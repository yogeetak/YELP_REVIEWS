That can&#39;t be right. I mean it was good but not that good. The sorbet and chili powder went great together, but it can do without the peanuts.

I realized they  don&#39;t specialize in fried eggs.(so over easy and over hard are the same to them).  What was disturbing to me was when I pointed out to the cashier/ server that the check was added wrong by $4.00 and she replied she was not the one that added the check .I politely asked her to re- add and she still added wrong along with and  8.8% tax.

Ordered the steak breakfast burrito a la Mexicana which is with peppers and onions. When the server asked if I wanted mild hot or half and half, I said with big eyes, &#39;hot&#39; and &#39;do you have extra spicy?&#39; She says in a concerned voice &#39;yes but you want half or on the side?&#39;.. looking away. I said, &#39;give me the spicy, I want the spicy.&#39;

When she brought my burrito, she was very concerned... and said hope it is ok... lol like it might be ruined.

Took one bite and perfect flavor and heat. There&#39;s not many Mexican joints that can get my nose running, this was spicy and so I ordered an extra side!

One note..I had to turn around on federal because I missed the place and there is no way to turn left going north. If you&#39;re headed east down 44th turn in to the parking lot just before federal. The wait staff was very friendly and the place is clean. Other than my server being concerned for me, I think the experience was pleasurable for all concerned."

What we ordered:
1. Chicken Cheese Chile Rice Burrito
2. Bean Cheese Potato Burrito smothered in Red Sauce

What we got:
1. Chicken Egg Cheese Burrito (chicken in one large piece, half of it inedible with tendons, etc)
2. Bean Cheese Potato Burrito smothered in pork green chile

I mean, it was a simple order. The dude was pretty rude and rushed my bf off the phone, which he thought was not a good sign and he was right.

We were in NW Denver, wanted Mexican food, and checked trusty Yelp for a recommendation.  Found this place, rated highly, and decided to give it a try.

When we arrived, there were 3 tables with people.  The rest of the place was empty.  The server took us to a table and gave us menus.  She never returned.  For the next 20 minutes, this is what happened.  A person would come into LF, go to the counter and place a carryout order.  The server would take the order.  Then another person would come in and place a carryout order, and she would take it.  And so on.  We never saw her go to the (now 4) tables of people and help them/us.  At some point, a nice young couple came in and seated themselves at a (5th) table.  The server never approached them in the 15 minutes that we and they were both there.  And strangely, when the server happened to pass by our table, she would smile at us in a friendly fashion.  Very strange.  I gather that she was very overworked.  But she never helped anyone at any of the tables.  So, we got up and left.

Amazing!  They were big chunks of sausage in the potatoes are fried with onions to golden perfection.  The green chili is packed with flavor but not a lot of heat so it&#39;s very versatile for even the most sensitive palate.

Although I had put it into my GPS, I still drove past the place. It&#39;s non-descript entrance is tucked away in the back of the tiny shopping center by the alley entrance...a single door with tan wrought iron securing it is all you will see under a tiny sign with the name hand painted on it. 

The inside is exactly as to be expected!  A food board with pictures of different plates offered his speech and above the single register.  The kitchen is right behind that filled with people quickly preparing the orders.

I have yet to be enticed into one of these little North Denver hole-in-the-walls that many praise so highly that I thought was even OK.  This one wasn&#39;t even that good.

It&#39;s a serious dump.  I mean even in Mexico this would be below acceptable standards in terms of appearance.  And, the food was even worse.  

No spice - nada - none - in anything I tasted.  Tried some chips and guac, followed by a combo with a soft chile relleno and a cheese enchilada (rice and beans on the side) - beans looked liked sun scorched mud and the rice was full of mushy frozen peas and carrots.  A couple of bites of each and I was out the door.  I&#39;ve tasted spicier baby food.

I simply do not have words to describe how terrible it all was.  BLAND, flavorless, dreck.  I give high points to the very sweet waitress but the food was malo malo malo.  I stopped at another Mexican place to fill up on the way home because this place left me so desperate for a little taste of something resembling food from South of the Border.

You walk in to an unassuming, hole-in-the-wall type setting. Pictures of some of their offerings on a large menu hanged above the kitchen entrance and cashier.  

We opted to dine in.  The tables were pretty empty when we arrive but 5 to 6 other groups walked in right after us and the place was bustling!

Conversation was easy and relaxed...we had some homemade chips and salsa and they we truly homemade--small portion but for two people it was perfect.  

Partner and I order 2 Deluxe burritos a la Mexicana with green chili, an order of cheese enchiladas and an order of tamales (both enchiladas and tamales came with 2)

The Burritos:  uh may zing!!! Seriously. We are breakfast burrito snobs and consider ourselves self proclaimed green chili officianados!  Lovely presentation with a burrito stuffed with delicious egg potatoes sausage onions jalapeños...mm mmm mmmmmm!!

The Enchiladas:  very nice.  Simple dish hard to mess up if you use fresh ingredients.  The green chili smothering made it that much better!!

The Tamales:  nicely done and cooked perfectly.  I feel these little bits of goodness can easily be ruined but these were on point!!!

I would normally give a restaurant with great food just four stars unless the ambiance was terrific too.  But the food is sooo good, I&#39;m rating them five stars.

Our favorite is the &#34;Special Burrito&#34; (chicken and rice) smothered with green chili.  We&#39;re very curious about their breakfast items because of the good reviews but we always seem to be near this place in the afternoon and we can&#39;t get enough of the special burrito.  Breakfast will just have to wait until we&#39;ve had our fill of the special burrito (if that can even happen).

We always seem to catch them at slow times when it looks like just the owners are there (man cooking and woman serving) and she is very nice, unassuming, helpful, and down-to-earth.

I searched Yelp for Mexican restaurants that were open in the morning, and called this place and they said they had vegetarian green chili.  We were not disappointed.  The green chili was terrific, in fact, they said that 70% of the chili they serve is the vegetarian version.

We really enjoyed breakfast here.   My husband and son enjoyed the Menudo, too.  We&#39;re planning to go back tomorrow."

So much better than the others I&#39;ve tried in this city - granted, I should have used yelp to help, but I guess I was just spoiled by having great Mexican food on every corner being from San Diego.

The food here tastes homemade, and the people who work here are all really nice. I&#39;ve only had the one burrito, but it was a diamond In the rough. The potatoes were crisp and added nice texture, and I dig the chili thing that Denver does. It definitely adds a little something extra.

Lunch was wonderful one day and a week later we had a less than average dinner with some of the worst service ever.  We had to request napkins, water, the wait was LONG and our food was disappointing, to say the least. The cheese enchiladas were not hot with the cheese unmelted inside.  Tamales were dry.  Margarita was supposed to be frozen but we had to ask for ice as they were warm.  I am so sorry not to be able to give a great review but one great meal and one terrible meal barely equals 3 stars.

 I was jealous, because i like my eyes and nose to water when I&#39;m eating.  I love that heat!  Overall it was pretty good. My tamales were very tasty.  I really knocked off a star, because their rice was weird. It has a bag of mixed frozen vegetables thrown in it, and it doesn&#39;t really give it a very authentic flavor.

Very tasty with the pork being shredded (++). I also had the tamales. While a little on the smaller side (2/$6) it was nice to see shredded pork in there too. Chips are good and homemade, salsa had a decent mix between heat and flavor. They also give you these side cups of salsas that offer different flavors to add, one of which being a habanero sauce. I&#39;ll be back if I&#39;m in the area. The kids liked what they order too. Very little left to bring home. On the menu, I did notice that the table menu is missing a considerable number of dishes that they have on the board.

The breakfast burrito was pretty darn good, especially considering it was only like $4.00. I am definitely going to go back for some more breakfast burritos.

I have compared their version with highly touted burritos from a dozen or so other places, and I have come to the passionate conviction (!) that La Fuente makes the best breakfast burritos in all of Denver. 

I get their chorizo, eggs, beans and cheese version, with spicy chili inside, for the best $3.50 mobile breakfast in town. Of course, you could get it smothered with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes and more chili, but I&#39;d call that brunch or lunch; not a breakfast that you could eat on the way to work.

Bottom line: If you can show me a place that makes a bettter one, I&#39;ll buy one of em for you. But if you try one from La Fuente and you change your mind and come to conclude that La Fuente does indeed make the best breakfast burrito in town, then you buy me one. Deal?

In my endless search for the perfect pig (as in pork burrito) I can happily say that the pork, bean, cheese and green chili burrito is as close to perfect as I can imagine. So simple, the ratio of beans to carnitas is heavily weighted on the side of the pig with just enough refritos to add texture and a different flavor. The pork is perfectly tender, moist and well seasoned. For $6.25 this &#34;deluxe&#34; burrito is big enough for two, or should I say big enough for lunch, followed by breakfast (yea!). The green chili is a classic Colorado style, not too thick but not runny. I go for half-n-half hot and mild which is just the right amount of heat (your lips will be tingling with delight afterwords). 

Very attentive and friendly service in a clean and pleasant atmosphere - I love the music in Español in the background.

The food quality was very good. It was reasonably priced and I left with a yummy vegetarian breakfast burrito smothered with green chili in my belly.

The service did leave a bit to be desired. There was only one girl working the entire front end handling table waiting, hostess, and to-go responsibilities. It took quite a while to get the bill and pay and we never got drink refills.

However, the food and price made it worth it. I would not rant and rave about how great it is, but I will certainly be back and would suggest giving it a try."

I tried the chorizo breakfast burrito and made it delux.

It was totally worth it.  The service was friendly, no-frills, sufficient and fast.  
I also loved it that they served alcohol and did not seem to judge me for ordering a strong &amp; spicy bloody mary on a Saturday morning.  The bloody mary was exactly that: Strong &amp; spicy - can&#39;t complain.  The burritos are huge so I could only eat about half of it - the leftover still tasted great the next morning, btw.

This place rocks!
We went for lunch on a quiet Thursday afternoon and had a wonderful time.

+ Very friendly, helpful and competent service.
+ Mexican music playing in the background.
+ $1 domestic beers on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
+ Pleasing artwork.
+ Spotlessly clean. http://www.denvergov.org/eh/tabid/444692/Default.aspx?establismentId=8672&amp;InspectionDate=6/4/2012
+ Food:
$2 guacamole side is an excellent value
My chorizo torta with fries was delicious and huge. I did not finish it.

- No Wi-Fi and the AT&amp;T cell reception was pathetic. I think it is due to the steel in the windows and doors.

Very much recommended."

I know nothing of their full meals, drinks or service. I stop by on my way into work when I am super hungry and this always hits the spot. 

Each breakfast burrito is $4 and I think it is safe to say it is 5x the size and quality of Santiago&#39;s $1 breakfast burritos. A good deal no matter what. 

Combined with the fact that these burrito&#39;s are assembled AFTER ordering and La Fuente is now far ahead of the competition. Their hot sauce is good - actually hot but with flavor. The burritos are made quite quickly - usually less than a 3 minute wait (just enough to check on work emails sent overnight before getting back in the car) before I&#39;m back on my way. I&#39;d say I&#39;m typically in and out in  under 5 minutes. 

The staff is always cheery &amp; friendly. The place is never so busy that I feel put out waiting but there are often 2-3 other people ordering just before or after me. They seem to  have just the right flow of patrons. 

Yes, the place is dated and a bit run down. Yes, signage (and spelling) could use some work, but the breakfast burritos are legit, fast, and a good size for the price."

The storefront is so small that I had been using a bus stop directly in front of it for a few months without even noticing it ... until that fateful morning, when I was in desperate need of breakfast.

I had precisely four minutes until the #44 was due (and as all RTD riders know, buses only arrive on time when you count on them being a moment late, and only arrive a minute late when you hope they don&#39;t). I needed fuel -- good fuel. I had literally run to make my first bus and left the house without breakfast, and was about to endure an arduous work day. I scanned the area urgently -- Starbucks? No food of substance, and certainly not without costing an arm and a leg, and I needed those. Chicken place? They were always slammed and slow, and ALL the way across the street -- there was no way it would work out in time.

Suddenly, behind me, overshadowed by the glamour and banners of a pretty fantastic head shop, I realized that the little thing on the end that looked like a tiny hole-in-the-wall general store was totally a Mexican restaurant ... and it had a sign for breakfast burritos.

Knowing those might be pre-formed, and therefore instant, I let out an internal &#34;HELL YEAH&#34;, and investigated. The empty shop held only a friendly young chick at the counter, and a smiley older lady back at the grill.

I announced, &#34;I have exactly three minutes until the bus is due -- can I get a burrito?&#34; and the girl said &#34;Yes, definitely!&#34; While I contemplated ingredients and rapidly settled on chorizo, she relayed my order to the older lady, and I could tell she conveyed the urgency of my situation, as the older lady started whipping up fresh ingredients on the grill faster than I could even keep track of.

The prices included tax, which was awesome for my mental math purposes. I&#39;d used my only cash on bus fare, and asked if $3.75 was enough for a debit card or if I needed to pick up something else. Helpfully and accommodatingly, knowing I was in a hurry, the cashier insisted that I didn&#39;t need to worry about it, so I tipped $2 to bring the adjusted total over $5 because I felt bad for the low amount. I figured that their willingness to hurry for me, and the great smell in the shop, suggested that this would not be a wasted statement of a tip.

We exchanged our thanks, I was handed a big heavy hot mess of amazingness, and I scurried out front to the stop. And ... wow.

Wow, man. Dat burrito, tho. Wow. 

The cheese was totally melted and everything was well-mixed and obviously freshly cooked and perfectly seasoned and perfectly integrated and barely held itself together and ohhhh maaaannn they make a fine breakfast burrito.

I poked my head back in, told them the burrito was amazing and I&#39;d see them again soon ... and was back the next night with my boyfriend!

The same waitress and same cook were there, and the waitress remembered me (I had just dyed my hair in between visits, too, so mad props to her ... I can&#39;t recognize people ever to begin with, let alone on Difficulty Level: Restaurant and people using cheat codes like dyeing hair!), and she was honored to have us back after my first visit.

My boyfriend got fajitas, and if I recall correctly, asked for them with a meat which they weren&#39;t listed with on the menu, but it was accommodated without trouble. I got the green chile or something else equally memory-wipingly good, and we tried the flan (I like softer flans rather than firmer ones normally, but the flavor is great and my boyfriend likes the firm styles and theirs is his favorite he&#39;s had) and everything was just so damn good. There was a small rush right after we arrived and ordered, and the same cashier was the to-go/counter/waitress/everything-but-the-cook, and she still somehow managed to handle everyone in a reasonable time. We were very impressed with the quality of the food (oh man ... dat obviously-homemade salsa with the chips, mmm) and the affordability. I had to double-check that the waitress remembered to charge us for the bottled Coke (hell yes, Mexican Coke!) because the bill worked out to be at least five dollars less than I had guessed (yay for including taxes).

We needed an &#34;our Mexican food place&#34;, and La Fuente is it. Don&#39;t blink or you&#39;ll miss it (we didn&#39;t even know the name of the place until I looked it up so I could review it) ... and you definitely don&#39;t want to miss it.

The &#34;Bob Evans&#34; style sausage links they chopped up and threw in were a little off putting and weird tasting, but the rest of the dish was quite good. 

Let&#39;s be honest, the &#34;hot&#34; green chile sauce here could probably just about rescue any dish. Great stuff.

But both are extremely good. 

I lived in San Diego for years and had burritos several times a weak from some amazing places, this place fills that void.  I took my wife over their for breakfast after buying her a burrito two separate occasions for her to try but me eating it for lunch before she can get home.  Ha.  

The service is amazing, and the place is a lot larger inside then it appears from the outside. Comfortable dining, and you can sit, eat, and pay in 20 minutes if you need to."

I can&#39;t wait to go back and have another one.  Maybe it was because I was so hungry or maybe it was the wonderfully tender pork green chile.  Either way, if you&#39;re on the hunt for a good breakfast burrito you should add this to your list.
The menu consists of a variety of breakfast burritos with your choice of meat.  In addition to the meat, they come filled with thinly sliced fried potato (not big chunks which I don&#39;t usually like), egg, and topped with cheese, green chile, and tomatoes &amp; lettuce.  
Green chile comes in medium or hot and we chose the hot.  I could&#39;ve gone for hotter but it had a nice flavor and didn&#39;t leave me with the urge to pour on more hot sauce.
They have fountain drinks as well as several bottled drinks in the cooler.

If you find yourself short of mouthwash, detergent, a giant bottle of ketchup, cholula, or some cigarettes ... you can pick up those items too. 

Look for the big breakfast burritos sign out front and enter through the iron bar door, grab a seat, and enjoy!  Hours are 7am to 6pm EVERYDAY."

They do have specials...dollar oysters Mondays. Can&#39;t wait to try it out.

Give me your sweet, your salty, your slimy masses! Obviously, I was really excited to try this place. A good sized group of us went and let me start with what went well: the oysters were fresh, properly shucked and damn delicious. We also had the swordfish, which according to the waiter &#34;flew in four hours ago&#34; and how can you say no to that?! Although it looked dry, it was actually cooked perfectly. The clam chowder tasted genuine New England to me (the white chowder, not red). We also had multiple rounds of wine and Bourbon Peach Mules and for the most part, everything served was spot on and a good time. 

Unfortunately, the service was really disappointing. It started with us ordering another mule and the server coming up and saying, &#34;We can&#39;t serve the mule because we&#39;re out of copper mugs. One of you will have to finish yours first.&#34; We really thought he was joking, until we realized he wasn&#39;t leaving the table. Ok then! We were in good spirits, so we looked around us and said, &#34;Ok, hurry it up! Someone chug!&#34; That&#39;s right, we classy people were yelling &#34;Chug! Chug! Chug!&#34; as the server looked on and waited. The rest of the night, he seemed in the weeds and it was hard to get his attention. When the bills came, they were higher than the prices posted. I was honestly willing to let mine go as it was only a few dollars but a friend of mine spent over $200 and wanted to fix his bill. He finally had to get up and go find the server, who in turn said it was the system and not his fault. Didn&#39;t immediately offer to fix it. Furthermore, he told another friend of mine that his bill would only change by a couple of bucks, essentially brushing him off. Needless to say, we asked for a manager. When the manager came, he asked for the rest of our receipts so that he can fix them, explaining he wouldn&#39;t have to re-run the cards or void anything, he would just &#34;fix it&#34; on his side. He never came back with the revised receipts and then was surprised when we asked about them. So, at that point we just left. It was all very unethical. 

To his credit, at around the time he was fixing our bills, one of their cooks was having an emergency in the kitchen which I&#39;m sure added to the stress. My friend, a doctor, happened to hear them asking around for help and went to offer her services. Imagine looking at someone&#39;s blood and vomit in the same kitchen that just served you though. Appealing, right? She stabilized him, then came back a little upset that no one even thanked her. In the end, they never apologized to us either. Between the emergency (understandable) and their reluctant service (not understandable), it took probably an hour for us to get out of there. We ended up finishing the night for more drinks and desserts at Second Home. 

If you are looking for happy hour with delicious oysters and great service, I highly recommend Jax Fish House. Seafood dinner at Capital Grille is also pretty good and even fancier, if you were planning on spending $200 on dinner anyway. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t see myself coming back to this place at all."

The service was great, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere great for date night or a girls night out. We ordered the broiled oysters, crispy cod, mussels in white wine and garlic sauce, calamari, yellow tail poke and haystack French fries. 

The calamari was way too breaded for my liking. The broiled oysters were interesting, had a good amount of flavor. The poke was very yummy, and was a good serving size. The mussels were very good but the cod took the cake, not because of the fish which was also very yummy and flakey but because of the amazing noodles it came with! Overall will be back!"

We were having a good time until we got our bills. 

The mules and some other items were charged higher than it is on the menu, and when we brought it to their attention, contrary to our expectation, there was no apology. Our server said, &#34;it&#39;s not my fault, it&#39;s the system that&#39;s set up wrong.&#34; To a friend who had already signed his bill without catching that error, the server said, &#34;oh it&#39;s probably about $3-4 off.&#34; Excuse me?? 

It wasnt about a dollar or two- it was about principles. We called the manager who also didnt apologize but just said he&#39;ll fix it, which then left us there for 20 more minutes waiting for it to get &#34;fixed.&#34; 

Then something happened in the kitchen where they were going around tables asking for a doctor. Luckily one of our friends was one, so she jumped in to help out in the kitchen when their staff was having a seizure. After she managed to wake up the patient back to consciousness, still no thank you, nothing. 

Only when she went back and told them that it was her who helped out their staff, the manager came back with a free drink card, aka the shut up card. Really?? 

I dont care how much i love oysters, bad taste in my mouth all around and will never return."

I digress.

Place has a clean hip feel to it. Music is pretty loud and obviously looks like this is the place to bring a date or meet friends for drinks at happy hour. 

On Monday the oysters are $1 each so we got those.  

We also split the cod entree. Although tasty, it really wasnt worth the $29 cost.

After being told of the 35 min wait at 2 other restaurants nearby, we&#39;re relieved to be serviced quickly here.  

Now on to the food.  How can I not order oysters at a place like this?  We tried half a dozen off the list, east coast won us over.  They were fresh and delicious.  The baked oysters with bread crumbs and butter were even better.  Oysters were juicy and flavorful.  Husband had his usual, a cup of clam chowder.  Again, the seasoning was balanced that enhanced the freshness of the clams.  

Then things went downhill... the stuffed clam with scallops and sausage looked promising, but the texture and flavor didn&#39;t deliver.  Garlic flavor overpowered the proteins, covered with mystery mush. My entree was almost unpalatable.  The tomato sauce in the Portuguese clams tasted like crushed tomato straight out of a can, watery and sour.  It&#39;s such a shame because the clams were fresh and tasty on their own.  Husband&#39;s braised short ribs were fine, but would&#39;ve been better had it been served with polenta instead of lobster pasta.  Being from Italy, he is not a fan of mixing seafood and meal flavor profiles.  

The service and atmosphere were good, the waiter was nice enough to remove the clam appetizer off our bill.  But I would come back for drinks and oysters, not for dinner."

Apparently, they have oyster $1 Mondays so really hoping to come back on a Monday. We tried out 3 different oysters and they all tasted fresh! We liked some more than others and this is a personal preference so I can&#39;t recommend which ones you should order. (Also, I can&#39;t remember the names of the three names right now...I should really write the reviews at the end of the meal.) 

We ordered the crab cake. It was really meaty but rather creamy and lacked the form of a &#34;cake.&#34; It was kinda of just crab salad in a creamy sauce pushed into a mound. Not a personal favorite but at least it wasn&#39;t just all flour and batter like some other places. I think it would be improved if it had a light crip to it on the outside.

The scallops dish was SO DANG GOOD! Scallops cooked just right on a pile of some type of fried rice. The fried rice is nothing like the ones at Chinese restaurants (I loved those too. Even more so, actually.) It takes some getting used to but it goes well in the dish.

The lobster bisque is rich and delicious. Good chunks of the lobster in it to taste. 

Friendly service to boot!"

My friend enjoyed the oysters and the mahi mahi tacos. I&#39;ve had a fish sandwich which was okay. It tasted good, but the sandwich fell apart while I ate it. The fish was far flakier than any cod I&#39;ve had before. And to be honest, I can&#39;t recall what I ate on my first visit--maybe a salad?

Cocktails were fine. Coffee was perfectly fine. See a theme here?

If a friend invited me to meet them here, I&#39;d happily go. But I doubt I&#39;ll ever suggest it. At their price point, there was nothing that stands out. And if I&#39;m going to brave a visit to Cherry Creek, I need a standout option."

It was much appreciated as we could then splurge on more of their food and drinks. The $1 oysters didn&#39;t disappoint and were all fresh.

After we were done slurpin&#39; those down, we each decided to start with their clam chowder. THIS WAS REAL GOOD. The potatoes were firmer than in most chowders so they held up nicely and weren&#39;t mushy. The chowder also came with clam fritters on top which were great for dipping in lieu of crackers/bread. 

I decided on the lobster roll for my main course. Unfortunately this wasn&#39;t as satisfying as the beginning of my meal. The lobster was good, but what missed the mark was the lack of mayo and a good bun. The bun was flimsy, dry, and fell apart rather easily.

First, the lighting in the establishment is horrific. Yellow fluorescent lights make anyone look sick and ugly. 

Second, if you are looking for fresh seafood presented in a minimalistic manner, this is not your place. 

The chowder was made with chorizo and simply tasted like sausage. 
I ordered a dozen kumamoto oysters and one was bad. I literally had to spit it out when I was met with the rotten flavor of spoiled seafood. The others did NOT taste fresh at all. I&#39;ve had WAY better at Jax and Stoic and Genuine. Stoic and Genuine has the best oysters in town if you ask me. 

So, fish and chips was mediocre. The fries were overcooked and very very crispy - so they were practically all fried oil. 

ummmmmmm.... my favorite part was the key lime pie. The whipped cream tasted like coconut and it was delicious. 

Blue Island Oyster Bar is going for more of the casual seafood fare at fine dining prices. I won&#39;t be back."

We also tried the octopus and several oysters. The octopus, though cooked perfectly, was quite the competitor for my butter knife. 
We rounded out this first trip with the key lime pie. Not great but the crust was so good. They should just do something with the crust it was that good. The key lime portion not limey enough.
Spendy, but delicious.
Service by Angela at the bar was great."

In true Sunday fun day fashion, I started my day off with the BIOB bloody mary. It&#39;s serious business. Topped with a fresh raw oyster, some grilled shrimp and the works! The drink itself was very much to my liking and had just the right amount of kick to it. I could drink these probably more often than I should. 

I had the scallop roll for my meal. It was good, but in comparison to the breakfast items, it just seemed rather small. I ordered a side of coleslaw with it, and my major peeve was that it was LITERALLY 3 bites for me, and I generally don&#39;t take in huge mouthfuls of food. Just sayin&#39; that this meal is kind of a rip off despite being tasty. At least fill up the sad little coleslaw side bowl so that it looks like you&#39;re getting more food. It&#39;s the cheapest thing on the plate for goodness sake! Oh well, at least I can look on the bright side and be thankful I had groupon? 

The service was great from walking in to being served at the table. All around friendly and attentive. Couldn&#39;t have asked for more in that department. 

I would most definitely come back for another bloody mary, and if you&#39;re going to get any grub, I&#39;d highly recommend the straight breakfast items just to get the most bang for your buck."

Went on a Sunday and was kind of surprised by the location, it&#39;s not likely in a place that too many passersbys would notice. But we wanted oysters and that&#39;s what we got. It was mostly empty when we went but that was fine. There aren&#39;t too many tables here but there is enough space for folks to spread out which is good.

All of the food we had here was good, but the oysters are very expensive. For $3.25 to $4 each that&#39;s a lot for an oyster but they were good. We also had the tuna tartar to start and then the lobster risotto. The risotto was amazing. Our drinks (martinis and mules) were very good. Our service was attentive but there weren&#39;t many people there.

I would like to go back but I think it would be more for food than oysters because they were so $$$! For a fancier place it should be more crowded than it is..."
blue-island-oyster-bar-denver,John V.,uS6rTQk1fyQO4EmxKK806g,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,413,20,Rqu16CD9WP4VFR6KnY9eOw,2.0,2015-10-22,"My first impression of Blue Island Oyster Bar (BIOB), a restaurant in the Concept Restaurants, Inc. &#34;portfolio of restaurants&#34; is that it is a very new restaurant which is still trying to find its sea legs, principally with respect to the food being turned out by the kitchen. 

What better way to start an evening at an oyster bar than with a selection of oysters, duh!  We selected the Kumamoto and Naked Cowboys (from Long Island Sound) and were not disappointed.  The oysters were fresh and each had their own distinct flavor, no complaints on the taste or quality.  The price point for each oyster was around $4.  Slurp.  

We then selected a variety of items from their sharable plates and one entrée: two orders of the charred octopus ($14), a crab cake ($16), steamed PEI mussels ($13), and the baked sea scallops ($24).  

The best of the sharable plates was the bowl of mussels. A generous portion to be sure, the mussels were steamed, and served in a flavorful curry broth, however I did think that the cilantro garnish was excessive.  Although not inventive in any way, this dish was executed well.  

The chef however deserves a drubbing for the brutal handling of the octopus dish, my least favorite of the items we&#39;d selected. When the plates were presented, I thought the food runners made a mistake and brought us some other menu item since at first glance there was no octopus discernible, not even one tentacle could be seen due to the heavy handed ladling of the chorizo vinaigrette which obscured any trace of the mollusc.  The gusto of the chorizo, albeit mild, dominated and obliterated any remaining flavor that the overly charred and dry octopus should have had.  The smashed potatoes served as an unwitting sponge to the leftover grease from the chorizo vinaigrette. It makes one wonder why the chef decided to cloak the main ingredient rather than highlight it.  Skip this dish.

The crab cake presentation was a lot less confusing, and although not as disappointing as the octopus, the cake was a bit mushy, with a slightly less than fresh taste which lingered on the palate after each bite. The Louie dressing was bland with no noticeable heat from chili or cayenne, and the pickled salad remained untouched on the plate by our group.

After trying the baked sea scallop entrée I can categorically say that not everything tastes better sitting on a Ritz.  OK, to be more precise, the buttery and delicate scallops were buried underneath what appeared to be at least half a sleeve of crumbled Ritz crackers.  Once again, I don&#39;t understand the rationale of hiding the main ingredient and making the guest play hide and seek in order to find each scallop.   The accompaniments included the same simple smashed potatoes used with the octopus and a side of sautéed spinach with tomatoes.  Yawn.

As for desserts, our dining companions dissuaded us from ordering the Key Lime Pie ($8) which they tried on a previous visit.  They did however praise the Ice Cream Sandwich ($6), which on this occasion consisted of two huge oatmeal cookies with delicious vanilla ice cream in between.  Although quite tasty and fun, this is a hard dessert to eat gracefully in public - none of us really minded.  Gluttons that we are, we also tried the warm Blondie with salted caramel and ice cream ($7).  This dessert was overly sweet due to the cloying caramel, with no salted-ness whatsoever.  

Service was efficient and friendly throughout, even if it was a bit robotic in that corporate overly trained way.  Relax.  

The space is nice and can be described as upscale beach chic. The banquettes and booths are upholstered in a watery blue; the chairs are handsome and evoke salvaged driftwood casually put together.  Above the long bar hangs an undulating whale bone sculpture made of warm wood, which although a bit overly stylized, fits with the overall unobjectionable coastal motif.

Now, please permit me to whine for a couple of moments.  

Why does Cherry Creek not deserve to participate in Denver&#39;s creative restaurant scene?  What did we do to piss off every creative chef in the city that they instead choose to set up shop on Larimer, South Broadway, or LoHi?  

The answers to those questions are likely a function of the real estate economics in the Cherry Creek North neighborhood: land prices are high, therefore rents are high, which then tend to result in corporate owned, multi-concept, upscale restaurants which usually end up being formulaic and all too often fail to execute and deliver on their promise.  Let&#39;s hope that Blue Island Oyster Bar can find a better blend of commerce, creativity and execution as it matures.  

Thank you for indulging me my whine."

Despite my proximity to Cherry Creek, I tend to avoid the pretentious restaurants that are sprinkled throughout the neighborhood. However, I love oysters and clam chowder and ahi tuna and wine, and all four of those things were excellent, and reasonably priced, at Blue Island Oyster Bar. Plus our server was adorable and knowledgeable and patient with our ordering indecision. Like everywhere else in Cherry Creek, parking sucks (although they do offer valet for $3!) and the crowd is Cherry Creek-y (read, slightly older, slightly over-dressed and slightly more artificial than general population of Denver), but this place might actually survive!"

I&#39;m not sure where to start. I received an email regarding &#34;National Oyster Day&#34; festivities so a friend and I decided to go check it out and it did not disappoint. They were so nice, didn&#39;t even give a dirtly look when we asked to switch tables because we were under the air conditioning vent and super cold. There was a small table tucked in a corner that would&#39;ve worked for 2, but was kind of crappy. We would&#39;ve taken it seeing as how we had asked to move in the first place, but they gave us a larger prime table for just the 2 of use - they would&#39;ve gotten brownie points for this move, butttt they don&#39;t need it. Our waitress was super patient with our questions and time it took us to order. We were just there having a low key, fun Friday dinner - and our waitress let us keep that vibe. Didn&#39;t rush us, gave drink recommendations, answered questions about the restaurant in general, kept our water glasses full and definitely added to the experience. Wait, I haven&#39;t talked about drinks or food yet, have I? We started with the lemon cucumber oyster shooter, and I had their signature martini. The oyster shooter was delicious and I&#39;ll probably get one next time. The martini was also great and lasted the whole meal(even though I wanted to drink it more quickly). We ordered oysters from the raw bar(of course), my friend had the fried oysters(which came on a bed of delicious shoestring fries... seriously.... will probably crave these later) and the lobster roll. I ordered the scallops. Everything was delicious. The scallops weren&#39;t all seared properly, but they were all cooked through perfectly and they were delicious. 

Tips (for you, or for myself for next time:-) ): The scallops portion was a little small - get a side to go with it. The lobster roll was good but the bread a bit much, will try the lobster salad with avocado next. Take an uber so that I (or you) can have 2 martinis. Take a group of people and order the &#34;Chef and Shucker&#34; as a starter.

It&#39;s not a matter of if there will be a next time, just a matter of when."

I had the Monday oyster special ($1 each on the special of the day), lobster salad and salmon tartar sandwiches. The oysters were terrific - very yummy, nicely rinsed so no sandy taste you get with lower end joint. The lobster salad was really terrific - I could have had a second one on the spot. The salmon tartar I thought was so so. I didn&#39;t like the spicy sauce on top of each sandwich (wasn&#39;t listed on the menu) and I thought the bread was too heavily soaked in something (not sure what) - I would have preferred a crispy bread. 

I would return. And Monday oysters are a steal!"

You know you&#39;ve come to the right place when your loud geeky friends are struck silent because they&#39;re too busy eating to carry on a conversation.

I loved the modern, open feel of the place and the driftwood chairs were both cool to look at and comfortable to sit it.  Our server was fantastic - fun and personable, solicitous without hovering.  Drinks were promptly refilled without having to ask.

My only gripe is that the space is pretty loud when it&#39;s full, which it certainly was on $1 oyster Monday night."

A friend and I stopped by for National Oyster Day and really enjoyed our experience. We went all out starting with raw oysters - and boy were they big and delicious. We also got oyster shooters - whaat?? The sweet pickley shot was tasty on it&#39;s own. Once you&#39;re trying to take the whole shot, oyster, chunks, and all, you feel like a chipmunk. I loved the fried oysters. Although 2 of the 6 oysters had that gross low tide taste, the others were immaculate. I&#39;d order them again in a heart beat. They were served with shoestring fries that were so tasty they prompted us to tell stories of the best fries we&#39;ve ever had. 
The entrees were a bit pricey for their size, but not outrageous. I believe I paid $24 for a lobster roll. The lobster was tender and juicy, but the celery flavor was the star of the show. The lobster should really be the star. I also ripped off at least 1/3 of the roll, it was too much bread to lobster ratio. My friend&#39;s scallops also got a good review, but would try something else next time. 
Despite asking the waiter the same question many times due to our own confusion, she was patient, friendly, and helpful. I enjoyed our dinner and would definitely recommend."

The lobster is okay, not good and not horrible. The bread is terrible...dry and firm. I&#39;m just glad I had water nearby to wash it down. My girl and I ordered a few other times that were just okay. Overall I&#39;d rate the food two stars.

The atmosphere seems to have some thought out into it. The decor sets the tone for some seafood and is in good taste. The decor bumped up my rating to three stars.

The service is pretty good, the servers have a nice attitude and are friendly. It&#39;s a place that has some potential, but will likely remain average. With the high rent and look of great food, I don&#39;t see a long future.

For those who read my reviews you know I am a big fan of high quality, properly shucked oysters. This place delivers.

We stopped in for happy hour where we had a half dozen of the no. 9&#39;s (Blue Island&#39;s signature oyster from Long Island) and a half dozen Island Creeks (MA), the latter of which are not on HH special by the way. Oysters were excellent. Because these were so amazing we ordered another half dozen more (all east coast), again all winners.

Bottle of Ridge zin which was reasonably priced I might add went well with our oyster tasting. We also had the fried clams- though they were good I am not sure I&#39;d order this again. I think it was $13 for this plate and there just weren&#39;t enough clams to justify the price point IMO.

Overall solid place, will continue to come here when needing an oyster fix."

So we eagerly made a reservation for Sunday at 11am due to the fact that the groupon said Sunday-Wednesday BRUNCH, lunch, or dinner...sweet!

Got there promptly at 10:55am and the doors are locked...strange...why would a place that serves brunch, has brunch menus on their website, and sells groupons for brunch open so late on a Sunday?? No matter we waited the 5 minutes and the doors were unlocked and when we went in it turns out the because of the cherry creek arts festival there was no brunch....interesting, but ok we were fine ordering lunch, no big deal I suppose. 

We order our food, which was OK. Not awful not spectacular. The fish and chips were the best thing...fries were a little over done, salmon spinach salad looked boring , fish tacos were pretty basic. The prices were fine had to food been spectacular but you would probably get the same flavor and quality from the local wahoos....only two beers on draft ...boring. All in all it was an ok experience, nothing to WOW us into coming back but nothing to deter us either .....

Until we tried to use our groupon......the server comes back with &#34;our GM says we don&#39;t take groupon on Sunday&#39;s&#34; I was like ok well the groupon clearly says Sunday through Wednesday...so not to sure about that...and he disappears for a moment and comes back with a pompous looking fellow whom I presume to be the GM based on his pretentious attitude and points out that there is this one weekend that the groupon is not honored which is this weekend due to the cherry creeks arts festival, which unless this place is always fairly empty I could not even tell was affecting this place.... Having spent years in the customer service industry I can tell you this is about as bad of customer service as you can have...I understand if you are slammed busy due to the event not honoring it....but I counted SIXTEEN open tables on the way out, not including the majority of open seating on the patio and the ONE patron at the bar....not exactly poppin bro....and given the average food it&#39;s no surprise why...the ambiance is cool, but you can&#39;t run a restaurant based on ambiance and location alone....you kind of have to offset that with food or at least service....not really sure this guys knows what it means to be in the SERVICE industry....I would recommend he take a lesson in that. I will say that our busser was great at refilling waters and clearing plates...he looked like a young kid that knew what it meant to be in the industry, I appreciated him....

All in all I will probably only be back to drink my groupon In cocktails and after that I never intend to come here again...there are too many other places that actually VALUE you me as a customer to waste my time on a subpar place like blue island ....."

I am so glad we did because this restaurant is amazing. Being from the east coast and growing up on the Jersey shore, it is hard to now live in a landlocked state and find fresh and well-cooked seafood. 

Things that stood out to me:

- The head bartender talked me into trying a cocktail I would never normally like (the Sayville Sling) and I loved it. The bar service was super friendly and informative. We  even got a back-story on the different types of oysters they serve and where the oysters are flown in from. 
- The waitress gave me samples of two wines I was torn on and suggested a great special for my meal. The scallops were delicious &amp; the side of honey carrots, I will now be trying to re-create at home. 
- Lastly, the decor and ambiance really do make you feel like you should be looking out to a waterfront view (instead of a snowy street view!). We will definitely be returning to try happy hour and the other dishes we couldn&#39;t decide between.

The oysters are still fantastic--plump, very fresh, tender, and with a real tang of the ocean. The wine list is well-selected and reasonably-priced with a good selection of wines by the glass.

Unfortunately everything else was disappointing. The waiter was friendly, but very inefficient. My wine was spilled all over the table. He lost my appetizer order and had to place it a second time (after I asked about it) which kept me waiting for food for a very long time. I waited another long interval to order my entrée and did not see the waiter again until it was time for the check. I ordered two crab cake appetizers as my entrée and they came out on two separate plates, then had to go back to the kitchen to be re-plated (poorly). I dined alone and it still took 90 minutes to get four oysters, a salad, and an entrée.

I ordered a special side, gilled corn (on-the-cob). It was awful; tasteless and mushy. I am astounded that the chef had the gall to send this out. No one had the courtesy to ask me why I took one bite and left the entire dish uneaten. The crab cakes were OK and have gotten a bit bigger than the original size (which was ridiculous for the price), but I still find them very pricey at $16.00 for one two inch cake. The pickle salad that came with the crab cakes was drenched in so much vinegar that it was inedible and ruined the taste of the crab.

The chef during the opening weeks had a very light touch and good attention to detail. All of the food was excellent. Clearly there have been changes in the kitchen and quality control has fallen apart. Too bad."

On a dreary Monday, my daughter and I stopped by to have some oysters for lunch. We sat at the bar and Angela came over immediately to welcome us. We started with the oysters (fabulous), then moved onto a fresh fish entree.
Everything was perfect!
Thank you Angela for your great recommendations and stellar service.
Our blah Monday was transformed into a Friday :) with your help.
We will go back as much as we can!"

My wife loves octopus and a well prepared one can be hard to find.   She loved the version here.  Creative and fresh.  I had the burger and lobster combo (best of both worlds) and my wife shared the lobster.   Again, great execution.   We both had a glass of sauvignon blanc.  They have Kim Crawford by the glass which paired nicely with seafood.   

We also tried several oysters.  The variety here is unmatched in Denver.   The restaurant is owned by and oyster farmer and they get a huge variety of fresh ones daily.   We are not experts but we fond several that are now our new favorites

We really enjoyed our visit and will be back.  A very comfortable atmosphere and great food"

Couldn&#39;t make up our mind so we decided to order everything off the oyster menu.  Our bartender was really knowledgable with the different types of oysters.  I think the only thing I didn&#39;t really like or cared much for was the clam.  It was bland.  But everything else was delicious and distinctly different when it came to flavor and level of brine and what not.  The charred octopus with chorizo on top of smashed potatoes is also a must try!  So two orders of every single type, few beers, and the charred oyster came out to approximately $130 before tip, so yeah this place is not cheap, but it was well worth it in my opinion."

Great and modern decor, awesome service -- located in all-new building next to Cherry Cricket, so just another great option all-around. 

Enjoyed lunch -- we started with 1/2 dozen of oysters (due to $1/ea special) -- served nice and cold and very, very fresh &amp; tasty -- truly exceptional fish tacos; made with swordfish!! ...and the side of sauteed spinach was a perfect complement!"

Started off with cocktails and raw oysters.  Can&#39;t remember which ones, but at half a dozen they were $3.25 each.  Easily could&#39;ve eaten another 2 dozen. I wish I remembered where they were harvested from as they were the freshest tasting oysters I&#39;ve had being this far away from any ocean. 

The crab cake and fried clams came shortly after with another round of Cosmos and Cherry Creek Mules. No complaints here either. 

The main course was, Fish and Chips, the NY steak, lobster risotto as an entree, and the Char.  Plates were bussed empty. 

We finished off with a raisin ice cream cookie and key lime pie. Both the pie and cookies crust was a little too crispy to my liking, but with a little effort, were destroyed quickly. 

Anyway, can&#39;t recommend this place enough.  Can&#39;t wait to come back and try some of their other oyster varieties."

I hope we haven&#39;t seen the last of $1 oysters at Blue Island because they were really fabulous.  May I suggest a yearly event, at the very least?

Blue Island has its fresh seafood flown in daily from its Long Island farm (along with the local newspaper, according to our charming server).  Normally, happy hour oysters are $2 each and they are a different variety from the $1 oysters we gobbled up.  Other happy hour bites range from $3 to $8 and the HH drinks run from $4 beers to $5 cocktails to $7 glasses of wine.  At the liquor store, I stumbled across a bottle of the same wine I was served here and, let me tell you, they are making quite a killing off those glasses of wine.  Next time, I think I&#39;ll go with a cocktail.

After my friend and I polished off our oysters, we shared the steamed mussels in wine sauce, a generous portion reasonably priced at $13.  The sauce was very tasty, not too buttery or garlicy, and the mussels, of course, were fresh and delicious.  We were too full for dessert but everything on the dessert menu looked appealing.

While I certainly do appreciate the wide variety of seafood dishes Blue Island features on the dinner menu, I was really put off by how many of them were either fried or smothered in breading, crackers, and other inferior ingredients.  If you&#39;re putting forth the effort to fly in fresh seafood every day, I think that seafood should be highlighted instead of drowned.  Ironically, crackers are not offered with the raw oysters, though I feel sure they could scrounge some up if you asked.

The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere.  The color palette consists of soothing ocean blues and calming driftwood browns.  A comfortable banquette flanks one wall and a large wrap-around bar sits on the opposite side of the room.  A small patio out front faces 2nd Avenue.  I&#39;m looking forward to returning for more raw and minimally prepared dock-to-dish seafood."

And they have a regular happy hour with a different range - so we got some lovely wine!

Staff is very friendly and helpful! They explain how they work and that the oysters are flown in every day from NY.

The rest of the menu looked pretty tasty as well, but our eyes were set on the oysters!

The atmosphere is neat and service doesn&#39;t disappoint. It&#39;s difficult to pinpoint a favorite item on the menu because I have literally enjoyed each and every thing I&#39;ve ordered. A few of my favorites : baked oysters! (We don&#39;t leave there without ordering) -- garlic mussels ; So creamy &amp; delicious! The portion is also great for a few to share. I&#39;m also a big fan of the clam pasta.. Creamy with a little kick of spice!

Raw oysters were fresh and sweet- the fried in cornbread was yummy but the fresh incredible. We also did the Stuffers( worth every penny) and the heirloom salAd.  

The mule variations on the drinks were really fantastic too! We will definitely be going back for $1 Oyster Mondays!"

We split the smoked trout dip. Whaaaat? Holy cow, this was Ka-razy yum.

Hubby got the clam pasta. He said it was &#34;soooo good.&#34; That&#39;s big praise coming from him, as he is a man of few words.

I had the lobster crab risotto. Super duper yummy. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was it had some kind of crispy grass-like element on the top that did not taste good and had a very inedible texture. Moved it aside, all was well.

I was here on a Monday at 1pm so it wasn&#39;t busy at all. I was impressed with the oyster selection so I ordered once of each to try.. I have to say the French Kiss oysters were my favorite. They were sweet, juicy, and didn&#39;t have a salty, fishy aftertaste like most oysters do. I ordered the tuna poke, clam chowder, lobster roll, and haystack fries (from the dinner menu). Aside from the French kiss oysters, everything else was just okay. It didn&#39;t taste bad but it was nothing really special. In addition, they have $1 oysters on Monday.. This special can&#39;t be combined with the groupon. We still ordered them anyway.. The oysters were good and clean.. $1 is a good deal for them.

Wait staff has been excellent, very friendly, non-rushed....just good service!

Decor is really cool, love the &#39;whale bone&#39; ceiling, inviting bar area ...the only negative thing I can mention, is the place gets pretty loud as it gets busy, they need better sound acoustics...no easy feat with the high ceilings.

Credit is due... I wrote in a previous review that I thought the portion/price ratio was off and changes were needed.  Not sure if it is permanent but restaurant week menu is excellent and they upped the quantity.

Had two stuffies for starters (very good) but the clam chowder looked great in a large cup with a couple of fried crab puffs on top.  Main course was fish with clam broth and 4 large clams and the other was a surprisingly delicious pork dish piled high on something but overall delicious. Desert was a good size and very tasty.  We were surprised and satisfied with the quality/quality and price ratio for restaurant week.

Not sure if this will continue beyond the special menu but after my last less than enthusiastic review it seems the dishes are still quality with enough extras to make it a satisfying meal.  Kudos for the change and highly recommended for Restaurant Week!"

We started with a few oysters from their awesome selection. The bartender Ben (?) recommended some oysters that were fantastic. Next, we split the lobster and crab risotto and the linguine and clams.

My husband met me at my office since its close to the Blue Island. It was kind of crazy finding a parking spot and we had to park far- no fun because I was wearing heels after an 8 hour day but every thing else was superb!! They had $1 oysters so we got a dozen of the special. We also got the fat bastard, hamma hamma and the royale. The oysters were small but fresh and tasty. Probably some of the freshest I&#39;ve had in Colorado. As long as you got the taste right, the size doesn&#39;t matter.  Also got a $24 lobster roll. Also small in size but the taste was amazing. Buttery roll- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. There were big chunks of lobster that sat in the roll. Sweet and succulent- you could tell it was good quality Maine lobster. The haystack fries weren&#39;t that great. They had some sort of mustard sauce on them, scallions and fried onions, I don&#39;t know what they were going for with that one but it was executed poorly and my taste buds weren&#39;t happy with the fries- but I came for the seafood, not the fries. Service was great and we ate so many oysters that I actually felt the aphrodisiac effect... Needless to say we didn&#39;t even make it home to romp lol. I really enjoyed the Blue island oyster bar. They shuck right in front of you, service is great, the food even better and the environment was fun and relaxing- exactly what I need after a long day at work.

 Oysters on the cheap buffets are 10 times better (if not fresher then at least 2 times bigger) than what you get here. Menu items are limited and signature item was dissapointing to say the least. $54+ for a platter that doesn&#39;t feed 3-5 unless those people wanted to just snack lightly is ridiculous. One of the drinks ordered had several flakes of aluminum from a bottle of champagne floating on top.

 The waiter was forgetful, slow, and neglectful.  When we told the manager and she chewed him out in front of customers , he came back with a strong attitude.

Blue Island is a charming spot in the Cherry Creek part of Denver, about 5 miles from downtown, well worth the visit. The room itself is delightful, the food perfect and the staff both efficient and charming. Happy hour specials are remarkable - like $1 oysters on Mondays. $20 lobster specials on Wednesday. Frequent diners get frequent email thanks with discounts. It is a great place to meet friends, hold a business meeting or celebrate with a loved one.

Oysters....well, great!  But WAAAY overpriced.  At $4 ea for most, that&#39;s $48 for a dozen denverites.  Double or close to double everyone else.

Until then...better prices around town for the same.  Really want this place to work, but the value is just not there (yet)."

Went for brunch.  We had the lobster scrambled eggs and the scallop po boy at our table.  Also ordered bottomless mimosas to drink. 

The waitstaff were the least attentive I&#39;ve experienced in some time.  The food took a while to come but not horribly long.   There was no concern about drinking too much as both our water and mimosas would be empty before someone would come by to offer a refill.  

The food was tasty but really couldn&#39;t make up for the service."

The place itself is very open and spacious.  The hostesses were super friendly and helpful when it came to bringing our baby and stroller for dinner.  The map of Long Island on the wall made my husband, a Long Island native, super excited for the meal.  My husband ordered seafood options and loved what he received, particularly the oysters.  We ordered french fries for the table that came so heavily covered in mustard that they were soggy and inedible.  Then, I ordered the steak, informing the waiter I was dairy-free and requesting a salad on the side.  Our waiter, who was a main cause of my low rating here, brought me a salad with cheese on it!  He didn&#39;t return for 10 minutes after the entrees were dropped off, so I ended up trading with my mom for her non-mustard-covered fries. The steak was a really odd choice cut and came pre-cut with so much fat on it that I could barely eat it.  Very disappointed for the price. My parents both got the burger that they both said was super tough and over-cooked.  Again though, because our waiter was MIA for so long, they just ate what they could.  All and all, it was a very disappointing meal for those of us not eating seafood.  I think my husband will be on his own to return.  Also, just a note, not having parking nearby or valet is a mistake for this price point."

We went in for dinner and were sat at a table that was in a high traffic area and felt very awkward.  They relocated us but the new table wasn&#39;t much better.  We then ordered oysters which were good but very pricey ($4.75 for a kumamoto).  The worst part of the experience was their menu and what they offered as gluten free options.  Most restaurants in Cherry Creek are very accommodating.  Blue Island had none of their main entrees available gluten free and the waitress basically told us &#39;sorry&#39;.  After spending $100 we left and ended up going to Cho 77 which was much better with experience/food/service.

The sauces they use are so delicious and flavorful. the ambiance is classy and the servers and bartenders are all extremely knowledgeable. I give this place 5 stars."

From the looks of this restaurant, it seems a little upscale. We came in sweatpants and caps and they didn&#39;t make us feel underdressed or uncomfortable at all. Everyone is so polite! 

We ended up sitting at the bar and the bartender was great. She told us about their happy hour and was very patient with us while we looked at the menu. 

Started off with mojitos - the only have one flavor, boo. 

Mussels appetizer: (20/5) this dish made my day. It is loaded with a generous amount of mussels, in a garlic tomato broth. The broth is to DIE FOR. It&#39;s not actually a broth, it&#39;s a sauce. But since I was down with eating it like a soup I&#39;m gonna call it broth. 

Nona&#39;s shells (4/5) creamy, cheesy, delightful. Carb explosion. 

Pizza (3/5) we built our own pizza. Although it came out looking great, it wasn&#39;t the BEST pizza ever. Usually when there&#39;s the word pizza in the name I expect this. I wish the crust was thicker. Something about a thin crust I don&#39;t like. It&#39;s huge and shareable.

The crust was delicious though -- and I loved how it was charred on the bottom.

The pizza is not the best I have eaten, but it is pretty good for American standards. My husband ordered the Diavola, which to me had too much salame and not the right kind. But oh well. I got the Margherita, which was good but I thought could have used some extra mozzarella.

The goats cheese and mozzarella together on mine was amazing but it really could have used more mushrooms &amp; the EVOO on it made it that tiny bit too oily."

Food - most excellent, incredible combinations. The duck and fig pizza is worth dying for

Environment - great location, great area, perfect if you&#39;re seeing a show at the DCPA, service is usually pretty quick

Suggestions - Be prepared to turn tables and bring patrons their food in a timely fashion even amid a dinner rush. I met up with a larger group of friends for dinner before a show at the DCPA. We told the server as we were sat that we were on a time schedule. Yes, it was busy and yes the server disappeared for a pretty long period of time leaving us all wondering where she had gone. Two of my friends were left without food because our pasta, pizza and other meals were brought out before their salads were ready ???? Strange. When their food finally came, they had to shovel their food quickly so we wouldn&#39;t be late for our show.

Portion size was perfect for me and everything was nicely seasoned. That being said, my male friend ordered the same and found the portion size to be too small. Pizzas were enjoyed by our group and those who ordered pasta received very large portion sizes.

The main issue we had was with service and turnaround time. Our server was snappy to begin with but warmed up to the group by the end. A suggestion for a sweet wine was a challenge and the recommended choice was not enjoyable. Our question of how the bills could be split was met with a frosty response that she would see at the end.

We both were happy and satisfied with our choices and each took dessert home for later.  Canolis are my absolute favorite dessert and the pizelle cookie it was wrapped in was a different but nice choice.  My only complaint was our entree was brought out too early.

There was limited space on our table, but there was no way I was giving up the delicious appetizer before indulging in the entree."

Ambiance: adult and trendy. Amazing wine list, and Samuel (our waiter based on the receipt) helped us find a good wine despite the all-Italian list. Adult mood lighting, full bar, quiet without being overly intimate, so good for friends too. Also, you could choose lounge/bar with tvs and the dining area for different feels.5 stars

Staff: the host was friendly, and I never felt at a loss after I walked in, which is always a worry for me at a new place. Server was knowledgable, helpful, informative without droning, present, and friendly, but not pushy. At one point I saw he was busy but we needed our check, and like a good server, he did the scan as he passed us despite full hands, eye contact was made, and he was there his next available minute. 5 stars

Food: perfect!! My partner got a delicious pizza, and I had a half salad and the appetizer meat ball, which was without a doubt, the best meatball I have ever had. The salad was a delicious, fresh, flavorful salad that was definitely worth the price, like the meatball. The pizza was equally as flavorful and very Italian. Did I mention the glory of this meatball? My partner agreed. 5 stars

Drinks: Great Italian wine that Samuel helped us pick based on our preferences. I also had a lovely espresso cocktail for dessert. 5 stars

The ambience is nice, but for a Friday at 7:30, the place was pretty empty. Never a good sign. Our server was very friendly and was up front about the gluten free pizza being smaller (and a $5 up charge for gluten free?! Seriously?? This is the highest up charge I&#39;ve ever seen for a GF crust).  

Because the up charge was so high, I decided to go with the chicken. The risotto was well seasoned if s bit too dry (in my opinion risotto should be on the wetter side. They likely make it ahead and it sits in a pot for a while).  The grilled chicken was dry, the &#34;beurre blanc&#34; was tasty but the whole thing was a little dry and felt like it had been sitting under the heat lamp. Overall, not the best.

We often get a flatbread as a starter and especially enjoy the rosemary &amp; fig one - the fig is so good on the flatbread. We also love the Fresh Burrata (roasted garlic to spread on crostinis), though it&#39;s a lot of garlic for two to share.

All the pizzas we&#39;ve had are delicious, and probably enough for the both of us without a starter. Chewy/Tender crust yet has that wood-fired blistering, and always fresh toppings. Our last time in we had the Margherita and added chicken, which was a perfect compliment to the basil and sauce. Also love the spicy pies Pizza Rustica and Pizza Diavola. Really you can&#39;t do much wrong, though I do avoid the arugula on pizzas as it&#39;s as if there&#39;s a salad on top of the &#39;za, making it hard to eat and enjoy in my opinion.

Service has always been friendly and professional. Lots of space, with a great covered patio during the warmer months (good people watching too). And it&#39;s a stone throw away from the light rail, so it&#39;s easy to eat and then wait until the last minute when your train is coming."

Must order? The burrata!! The burrata comes with some sweet peppers and tons of whole roasted garlic cloves. My favorite burrata in the city by far! (Its worth the $13, trust me).

I was at the Convention Center for an event and needed something for lunch.  I walked down the street and smelled the wood-fires from this restaurant.  Since it was next to a Which Wich (yuck), I thought it might be a pizza-by-the-slice place.  It was/IS not but they do offer a small 8-9 inch-ish personal pizza.  I had time so I took a table.  As it turned out, this is not just a pizza restaurant but an Italian restaurant.... and it was PHENOMENAL!!!

I ordered a Porchetta Sandwich and a personal-sized Margherita Pizza.

For what-ever reason, I feel the need for a coke when I have pizza.  They offer a locally-made natural soda that is somewhat coke flavored.  If I&#39;m having soda, it&#39;s always better to have one made from sugar and not corn syrup and this tasted light and refreshing.  It was perfect.

The Porchetta Sandwich was unbelievable!  I haven&#39;t had a sandwich that good in 20 years (and in New York).  The natural jus was the best I have EVER had.  I don&#39;t know how they made the jus but it was to die for!  Be sure to double up on the side peppers that come with it.  They go great with the sandwich.  I think they&#39;re pickled.

The Margherita Pizza makes for a great side.  I&#39;ll get one just about anywhere.  To me, the taste of the crust tells me how good the pizza is and this one did not let me down.  It was top-notch.

Overall - great staff, great location, and great all-natural food.  It was a tremendous surprise and I&#39;ll definitely be going there the next time I&#39;m in Denver."

I had the meatball and a pizza. I almost canceled the pizza after I ate the meatball. It was GIGANTIC. I only managed to eat a slice and a half of pizza, and the slices are traditional very thin crust without heavy layers of toppings... So not huge. My dinner partners had the chicken, a different kind of pizza, and a pasta dish, and everyone loved their food. Definitely a good choice for friends in town and staying at a nearby hotel!

I went to the Yelp app on my phone and did a search to closest restaurants and Pizza Republica showed up. It&#39;s so close to the theater and I only had an hour to dine before the show. It was snowing in Denver and I expected the restaurant to be deserted. I walked in and people were everywhere, the bar was packed not a chair or table in sight, every table was full in the restaurant and there was a wait at the hostess stand. Not promising but the gentlemen assured me it would only be a 10-20 minute wait and food service is quick and I should be able to make my show. I went to the bar and ordered a Prosecco and the service was great. Another guy checked to see if I could take a reserved table at the bar but it wasn&#39;t available. Not too long after getting my drink my table was ready sure enough in 10 minutes. My waiter knew I had a show to catch and helped me order right away. He said pizzas are the best to order when in a time crunch because they come out in 5 minutes. He was very attentive and served me a nice glass of Toscana wine. They have a good Italian wine selection too. Next time I would love to come and try the meatball or a salad but since I was dining alone I didn&#39;t want to order too much food and I was in a hurry. The pizzas are quite large and hard to finish by yourself. I ordered the Pizza Giacomo and added Prosciutto which is awesome on top of the Arugula. The waiter brought my check ahead of schedule to make sure it was there for me when I needed to leave. Delicious Pizza and Fabulous service is why I gave 5 stars. It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve had that kind of attentive service. All the staff here is super friendly and they had a lot of theater goers dining there. We all left around the same time to catch our shows at DCPA. Great place."

We were seated right away and outside on the beautiful patio that is perfect for people watching. This was my second time here, the first was for a quick lunch before comic con.

I really like their vast wine selection and easy ordering system. Numbers! Which is fantastic and saves me from butchering the names of some of the wines. 

Not a huge fan of their pizza. It&#39;s not bad, just not excellent. Very bland. My friend tried the Ceasar salad and thought the dressing was awful. She took maybe 10 bites. She also commented that the croutons were too hard and awful to chew."

The pizza is enough for about 1 hungry person and on Tuesdays, they have a buy one get one deal. That is pretty much the only time I&#39;d go here because the pizzas are all $15+. The pizza is good but... it&#39;s $35 for pizza for 2 people without drinks or anything. Kindaaaaa pricey. The wine list is pretty solid, but again, pricey. Like another reviewer said, it&#39;s not really a pizza place or a high end Italian restaurant. It&#39;s a little bit in no-man&#39;s land."

It is made from scratch, however the bartender will make it according to your preference.  The outside patio is  very large and the perfect place for people watching.  The only disappointment I have is, in order to take advantage of the happy hour menu, you have to be seated at the bar.

He wouldn&#39;t listen to a word she said and was exceptionally rude and condescensing. Treating people with disabilities in the way that she was treated is not only illegal but reprehensible.

It was fishy and peppery and cheesy and crisp. My girlfriend had the Mixed greens, with a great balsamic and pearl onions pickled in port. We got the Vesuvius, half calzone, half pizza.

Specifics: I had the Grilled Shrimp Fettucini, which was terrific. For dessert, I *attempted* to make my way through the world&#39;s largest piece of Tiramisu.

Moving on to the food... After happy hour up the street at the lovely Oceanaire, we headed down the street to Pizza Republica for a bite to eat. Per usual, this girl wanted more than one item on the menu.  Everything looked yummy!  So, I did the typical Brittney thing to do and created a custom dish (of course with Chef&#39;s approval).  

While the Grilled Salmon in a Red Pepper Glaze sounded delish, I couldn&#39;t help to resist the Butternut Squash Ravioli&#39;s accompaniments! My final dish?  Grilled Salmon in a Nutmeg Sage Cream with Spiced Pecans, Dried Cranberries &amp; Goat Cheese... served with Zucchini, Asparagus &amp; Carrots. Yep!  It looks &amp; tasted as good as it sounds!"

Service - prompt.  Drinks - good. Beet salad - good.

Pizza - meh...  Undercooked, doughy, flavors not that great.  Overpriced as well, $13 - $17 per pizza, per person.  I can think of several places with better pizza in Denver - Sazza, Silvis, Mod Market just to name a few. Heck, even Pizzeria Uno is better.

It has a great location in the corner of the Convention center, but with the many choices in the area, I won&#39;t be going back.

Oh, and if the manager had done anything more than brush past our table with a &#34;hi, everything OK&#34; and then rush away before I could say anything, I would have given him the feedback directly.  Hint to managers; if you want feedback, hang around long enough to listen."

Started off with the mussels, which we remembered from last time and then also had an orange marmalade with bread that was very impressive. You can build your own meat and cheese platter, which came out really good after some suggestions from our server, who was very knowledgable about that and there wine list.

The meatball is awesome. The sauce is what really does it I think but it&#39;s great as a satellite dish or by itself as an appetizer.

Both of us ordered fish entrees: salmon and the swordfish. I&#39;m having a hard time deciding which was better; and to be fair I&#39;m not a huge fan of salmon and I love swordfish. Both were cooked meal extremely well in that they were never frozen and had the perfect consistency for the type of fish. The salmon had a sweet glaze that was the perfect compliment and the swordfish was done with a lemon sauce that accentuated the dish without removing from the main flavor.

Topped it all off with the cheesecake which had a pistachio crust. Had a great texture like it was made in house, not too heavy with wonderful flavor blackberry garnish. 

This experience upgraded my rating of this place from 4 to 5 stars, I will definitely be coming back when we are in Denver"

Service was friendly (thanks Edward) but the kitchen forgot one entree so that slowed things down.  Pizza was fine but nothing special about it, although the pepperoni on my pie was extra crispy, the way I like it.

Cannoli were good for dessert.  Cookies that come with the lunch special are lame...more like Chips Ahoy rejects.  

Everything was affordable but overall it was just kind of okay.  You probably won&#39;t have a bad meal here, but it also probably won&#39;t be memorable."

There were two employees standing at the front desk with their backs to the door and did not turn around once in the 5 minutes we waited for someone to acknowledge us. The restaurant was mostly empty, so we were not sure if we should seat ourselves or wait. Finally a manager walked up and asked if he could help us. There were two of us and we asked to sit outside, which was also mostly empty (one table filled); were lead to a table, asked if we could sit closer to the sidewalk and were told that he would need to go check. Hmmm. Ok, moving on.

Our waiter was attentive and was super friendly. The pizza was good. Crust was really good, the red sauce had nice flavor. I did a build your own with Ricotta and Artichokes. The Ricotta was amazing, but the artichokes were ehh. Wouldn&#39;t order them again since there was only one piece on each slice which didn&#39;t seem worth paying a per topping price for.

Third bite was the realization that they use authentic mozzarella cheese.

Pizza Republica is located right across from the Buell Theater and The opulent Spire, so it makes sense standards are high. The patio is great in the summer, and the indoor space is nice as well.

Now, on to the food! This place has an extensive Italian wine list! Unless you&#39;re an expert yourself, the servers can tell you as much as you want to know, or just give you a few recommendations (always necessary in my case, but they know what they&#39;re talking about!)

The Mussels Arrabiata, kill it! Save the sauce for the pizza too. I tried the Caprese salad; huge slices of buffalo mozzarella, tomato and basil.  Pizzas are beyond delicious! If you&#39;re in the mood for something different, try the Gorgio!

Have not tried dessert yet (Crave is across the street) but if the rest of the menu is any indication, I bet it&#39;s delicious as well. We&#39;ve brought several friends here since discovering it ourselves last year. Republica doesn&#39;t miss!"

Plenty of wine and beers to choose from.  The pizza, salad, and bites selection is pretty big but we settled on a few options that night:

Burrata to start: came with cooked tomatoes and huge cooked garlic pieces.  Although the burrata was tasty, it doesn&#39;t compare to Osteria Marco&#39;s burrata. 

My husband and I then shared the pizza diavola.  Now, I love myself a neopolitan style pizza: it&#39;s chewy in the center with burnt areas around the crust.  

To end the meal we shared tiramasu (delicious and creamy) and the nutella ravioli (skip it.... it wasn&#39;t even tasty). 

Although the service was fast, I was pretty unimpressed with the flavors of our dishes. 

If you are looking for delicious pizza I would suggest Marco&#39;s coal fire for a casual experience or Osteria Marco for a higher end dining treat."

I will start off with quoting the owner himself on their webpage:  &#34;I want our guests to feel the same sense of family that I felt growing up,&#34; says George Eder, owner.  I guess he was abused as a child.
It started off great with our food server Russell.  He was great.  Very helpful and knowledgeable.  My friend and I had a restaurants.com voucher (yes I know, old school).  We ordered appetizers, entrees and beverages.  We notified our server UP FRONT of the voucher.
All of a sudden the owner comes at us, growling (literally) at my friend and I from 2 tables away saying: &#34;I don&#39;t know where you got this coupon, but I have never taken them and I won&#39;t take them and if you want to use a coupon go somewhere else&#34;.  He spoke to us in a very derogotive, disrespectful manner, in front of other customers.  He was so angry we wanted to use a voucher, his face was shaking.  He was so rude, mean and nasty, two other tables of guests got up and left.  
We got up and left. The General Manager Rona (I think that is her name) was kind, and apologized through our server, but it didn&#39;t help.  As we were leaving, he was yelling for us to get out.  We are so appauled.  
I have NEVER been treated so rudely, by anyone.  
I used to go here a few times a month, bringing friends of mine from out of town, because it is close to work and such.  NEVER again.  I work for a large local company, I have told everyone I know what happened and how we were treated.
My family has owned restaurants my entire life, and I cannot imagine them or anyone else treating anyone so poorly.

Will I or anyone I know be back?  Hell NO."

First--I am very aware that &#34;hospitality&#34; has a huge impact on my opinion of a restaurant. In fact, great hospitality--a feeling that you are truly welcome and the staff is glad to see you-- can overcome a lot of shortcomings in food and service. 

Initial reaction at the door--Mediocre hospitality from the host. He seemed rushed and bothered. Not a great start.

We sat in the bar. This is where things got much better. The bartender/server was very pleasant, helpful, friendly, attentive and seemed genuinely happy to help us. And on top of that, her service was efficient and well-timed. She earned my respect, and she earned a solid tip.

Wine list is extensive. Maybe a little pricy...but not crazy expensive.

Food offerings are interesting. We had the duck pizza. Very good and unique. Also shared a half-portion pear salad that was nicely sized and tasty. The food came out in a timely fashion, and the pizza was hot.

All in all--Great hospitality once we got settled into the bar. Tasty food...some unique pizza offerings. A little pricy, but still a pretty good value. And the decor was inviting.

I&#39;d definitely return."

The Grilled Salmon entrée is a favorite - cooked perfect every time with all kinds of delicious veggies and this amazing jam-like topping.  Not too expensive either and just super good.  Mussels in a spicy, marinara-like sauce are incredible as well.  Everything is always consistent, which is a sign of excellence for a restaurant.  One of the best things about this place is the staff.  Genuine and friendly.  Carlos, the manager, is too nice, always checking in to see how everything is.  So sincere and warm.

We were interested to learn that they make their own mozzarella there . It was obviously fresh mozzarella used on the Quattro cheese pizza.

The tomato bruschetta was excellent . 

The soda is organic and delicious.

It looks like care was taken when assembling the menu and product . 

Our server was very kind too. He squeezed our pizza into a small box for us so it could fit into our small hotel fridge be individually wrapping the slices with foil. 

Again I appreciate the time and care taken"

The burrata was swimming in way too much olive oil, but the roasted garlic smooshed on to the bread and the burrata itself was quite nice. The salad and pizza were fine, but not really anything memorable.

Pizza Republica is an OK choice for pre theater, but there are other places I&#39;d prefer to go to before a show so I&#39;m not sure when we&#39;ll return."

Perhaps we ordered the wrong items but as it was a very late lunch for us, on our way back to Boulder from an appointment in Denver that left us without a meal since breakfast, at about 4pm. We were just about the only customers when we arrived and it appeared that there was only one staff member. We had one definite item to try and it came off fairly well. It was a Vietnamese crepe and we intended to share it but also order some other things. We asked about duck options and one was suggested but turned out not to be a good choice. We should have each just gotten our own crepe.

The crepe was beautifully made, enough meat and shrimp filling for a light meal but not the full filling of veggies we have had at other places. And I just love sautéed bean sprouts. The duck dish was literally just some duck backs, mostly skin and bone, just chopped and set on top of rice. Nothing else. Each piece had lots of little rib fragments which had to be separated out of each bite. The rice was perfectly made though, great texture and very aromatic and flavorful. We were not in the mood for soup but clearly that is where their strength must be.

Our other disappointment was in our drinks. Most of the boba in each of our drinks were so hard, they could could not be bitten into. In fact, after the first couple, I could not get mine up the straw as some were stuck (frozen?) together. I tried scooping with the pointy end of the straw and could not get them to the surface. The lychee base of the drink was just fine in flavor (I love lychee) but on the extra sweet side. My husband&#39;s boba were a bit more manageable, but most still too hard. He liked the Thai tea flavor though.

When we find ourselves in Broomfield again, we&#39;ll give them another try as so many love the place and order some pho and some other noodle options."

It took us longer than it should have, almost to the point of embarrassment to select something. The staff was very nice even if they thought we were insane- not like it was our last meal on earth. 

We shared the spring rolls and the crepe. The peanut sauce for the rolls was not good. It almost had a floral quality to it and we passed on second bites with it. The crepe was good too but definitely not filled with meat in any way. 

The fried shrimp paste noodle bowl was super tasty. I added what appeared to be house made chili sauce and it took it to a nice heat. Mixing the noodles, shrimp paste, lettuce and cucumber gave the dish nicely rounded flavors.

Have to say the food was good, but not extraordinary. The service was lacking as well, had the kids with and didn&#39;t feel very welcomed. The atmosphere was not very comforting, my son was pursuing the fairly extensive menu and felt we were burdening the server by not being ready to order right away. Only saw the server at our table to deliver food, and again at the end ready for bill and had to ask for more water. 

The bill (prices in general) was a little more than I expected also. 

The Pho was good, but lacking in flavor in my opinion even with the added basil and jalapeños. The spring rolls had a very strong minty flavor which was overpowering any other flavors, and the noodle bowls seemed more like dishes from a quick service Chinese take out. 

Bottom Line: food is ok, but I will choose another of the many options near by next time."

I&#39;m not from the area, so I chose this place based on Yelp  reviews. I probably should have looked at the pictures beforehand, but I was in a rush to find a place to eat. 

I ordered a rice platter- grilled pork with egg and a spring roll. My friends ordered something similar, rice platter and noodle bowl (vermicelli). We were amazed at the TINY portions of meat. None of us  are from the area, so we wondered if it was just like this at all Vietnamese restaurants here.  We&#39;re from Dallas and none of the pho restaurants give you such little meat portions. As you can see in the photos from other reviewers, the meat is sliced super thin and they literally give you like 10 pieces. The plate is mostly rice/noodle. If this is what you guys are used to in the Denver area, you are seriously missing out. You HAVE to try a Vietnamese restaurant  if you ever come to Dallas or Houston or Austin. I have been to a lot and this is by far the worst place I&#39;ve been to. The quality of the food was mediocre at best. Even the peanut sauce for the spring roll was just so-so. 

I also ordered a MILK tea. The server brought me a THAI tea. I thought maybe he just misheard my order, so I told him I had ordered the milk tea. He said &#34;yea this is milk tea.&#34; I told him it looks like thai tea (orange). His response was &#34;yea milk tea, thai tea same thing.&#34; WHAT? They are most definitely not the same, and if he mistakenly thought they were, why list both on the menu? 

This is one of the very few times Yelp has let me down."

I came with my dad on a rainy summer day for the Mi Quang. I had never tried it before this time and I thought it was a pretty delightful treat. I love how the noodles were cooked with tumeric giving them a yellow tint. The broth is super flavorful because they give you very little. You don&#39;t need very much! The only thing I didn&#39;t like is the skin was left on the pork so I had to eat around it, but I also know that when they are making the broth, this makes the broth more rich, so if they had taken the skin off, the broth wouldn&#39;t have been as delicious. It&#39;s a trade off that I can deal with. 

We also tried the Banh Xeo, a pancake type dish with lots of mung bean sprouts inside. This was really good! I loved how crispy the outside was and the warm sprouts gave another nice texture. I would order it again. Their Vietnamese egg rolls were delicious also and they gave plenty of dipping sauce (I hate it when places only give you a teeny thing) but this was a fairly large bowl.

My dad tried a rice plate with BBQ pork and some other various things. He didn&#39;t like his as much, but I think some things like the fish cake aren&#39;t for people with more &#34;western&#34; taste. But his pork was very good and the rice was more like fried rice instead of steamed rice.

PS: Reviewer, R T., from July 2013 mentioned that the &#34;Asian&#34; customers received plastic cups and the &#34;white&#34; customers received glass. Our table received glass and I am a mixed race human and my dad is Chinese-American. Also, I recall there were was a table with a Caucasian family that had plastic cups. I don&#39;t think that people would care enough to discriminate in the form of beverage containers."

I always come back because their broth are so clean and flavorful. This time my bf and I got the bun Bo hue and the #7 five spice duck soup. I asked for no blood cakes on the bun Bo hue since I don&#39;t like the thought of eating them. It comes with thick round rice noodles, fish cake, and some other types of pork and beef. You can adjust how spicy you like the broth since they leave the spices in one spot. The portion is pretty large too since I had to take half of mine home. 
The five spice duck soup is very comforting to eat. It&#39;s a clear bone broth (duck bone?)  with egg noodles, a bit of pork skins, and leafy vegetables. I like how they served the crispy duck on the side so that the skin doesn&#39;t get soggy. Honestly, I could drink the broth all day. 

The 5 stars is for the food. Service is quick and friendly but if you have some complicated question, expect to rephrase your question a few more times. 

I would come back any day for their soups. I have yet to try their other dishes."

Golden Bowl has a varied menu and offers a lot of Vietnamese staples from noodle bowls (bun), rice bowls and the typical pho dish. They also offer more selection of Vietnamese appetizers compared to the other pho houses in the area.
One really cool thing that they offer is dinner combinations: a bowl of beef pho, eggrolls (or springrolls) and a drink for under $9.00. This is a STEAL for as much food as you get.
The food is good, though I&#39;ll have to say food quality at Pho Duy is higher. But the price is much more affordable, the service is incredibly attentive and the place itself is spacious and very clean.
I will return to try a different dish but would recommend this place for a reasonable Vietnamese option (if uncertain, try the combination option) with great service."

I always start my review of a restaurant in the bathroom, you can learn a lot just from inspecting the bathroom. 

Bathroom nothing special a toilet and a sink, but they were clean and that is what counts. Soap and towels stocked which indicates the staff probably wash their hands.

Seating, there are ample choices inside for seating, tables and booths.  We were promptly seated and offered a highchair for our two year old.

Ordering was simple they have a wide selection of appetizers and entrees.  Most pho places have large menus, but most items are only slight variations on the same thing.  Golden Bown Noodle House has much more than just pho.

We ordered the fresh spring rolls and cheese stuffed won-tons for our appetizers both were very good, the spring rolls had both shrimp and pork in them and had a delightful minty basil aroma.

The entrees we had were the pho tai (broth and rare steak) and my wife had the special Vietnamese noodle bowl which came with sauteed pork, chicken and shrimp. The flavors for both were phenomenal, best and freshest taste in North Denver. I love pho for the spectrum of fresh, flavors and aromas and Golden Bowl Noodle House delivered on both accounts.

The service was fast and friendly, we were among the first to arrive for the dinner service, but even as the place became more busy the server had no trouble keeping up.

We left our first dining experience at Golden Bowl Noodle House both satisfied with intentions of returning again soon."

Honestly, I think the pho at Pho 79 (in the same shopping center) is a little better, but it&#39;s also pricier and there are fewer menu options in general over there.

Pho is solid -- I always get the meatball and rare steak and enjoy it every time.

Now for the bad. Their Pho is bad. You are better off walking to Pho Duy or Pho 79 for good Pho. The more purest Pho eater would probably go to Pho 79 but I like both. Their Bo Kho was fine/mediocre but not awful. I&#39;ve had better ones but it&#39;s acceptable just not anything to write home about.

That&#39;s right, Westminster, you hear that?  You know what they did?  They pickled and salted the crap out of that lime, and then they BLENDED IT INTO LITTLE TINY PIECES.  Maximum flavor saturation.  Every bit of lime went up my straw.  They also failed to add 100 teaspoons of sugar.  Take note.

Even setting the chanh muoi aside, I was still very impressed with this place.  My friend and I came here on kind of a whim, not expecting Pho 79 to be closed at 9:15.  But it was, and we didn&#39;t feel like rearranging our food cravings to accommodate some other type of cuisine.  We always used to do this when I lived here: first open mic, then pho.  Breaking this sequence is like breaking a habit.

I ordered pho with everything, he ordered bun bo hue.  I failed to see that they had mi quang on the menu - otherwise I would have ordered that.  But we were there a half hour before closing and I didn&#39;t have time to really peruse the lengthy menu.  Pho it was.  It was great - the broth was particularly delicious (though not boiling hot), and all the meat was just ideally cooked.  Cooked to pillow-hood, not to jerky-hood.  The tendon was average, as was the tripe, so the meat was the star of the show.  It was almost so flavorful as to not really need to be dipped in any sauce.

Bun bo hue was also great, second only to one place far far away.  Spicy, but not too spicy, bloody but not too bloody, herby, but not too... OK, that&#39;s a lie, it is very herby and that&#39;s awesome.

I would say this place is better than both Pho 79 and Pho 95.  I rated the other places before I moved to CA and started eating Vietnamese food constantly, and while good, neither of them pack the punch that Golden Bowl does.  Pho 95 has better tendon, 79 cooks their noodles a bit better, but Golden Bowl&#39;s meat and broth are just unbeatable.  I urge potential diners to overlook the divey exterior and give it a try."

I am so glad I did, though. This may be my new favorite.

Since my last review, we have gone back several times. While Pho will always be my one true love, I have yet to try anything that doesnt make my heart melt! 

The Bo Kho Banh Mi stew is simply divine. The sweet and savory broth is rich and dense. The meat was tender and the veggies were hearty, but what really sold it was the bread. Such a simple thing, but sopping up the broth in the soft bread and feeling it squish out across my palette with every bite was wonderful!

On the recommendation of other Yelpers, I tried the Mi Quang. Excellent!  It wasnt really what I *wanted* but it did not disappoint. I loved the fatty pork and the Mi noodles were lovely. I would absolutely recommend it! It has so much going for it! Next time, though, I will probably try another one of their Mi dishes. Time to go exploring! 

The Banh Xeo crepes were a pleasant surprise. I had never had it before and was SHOCKED by how big it was. A huge plate! A pile of lettuce, mint, and cucumbers! And a giant crepe stuffed with pork and bean sprouts! So so so so so good! 

And the people there are so friendly. The nice lady who remembered us (and our order) on the second visit has been so sweet and so kind every time we have gone back. I just want to hug her!"

I was in Vietnam over Thanksgiving and the food here tastes just like the food we had in Vietnam. And, trust me, there is more to Vietnamese food than Pho. 

The Goi Ga (chicken salad) and the papaya salad are fabulous.

The Mi Quang remains my favorite! Finish it off at the restaurant or if you box it, don&#39;t take the noodles home. They tend to dissolve in the broth making it starchy and unappetizing. What is Mi Quang? Our Vietnamese guide explained it as the Pho of the Central Highlands of Viet Nam with &#34;less water.&#34; It packs a lot more punch than Pho.

Their rice paper rolls are delicious. As are their fried Vietnamese egg rolls. 

We&#39;ve had Pho only once at this restaurant. It was Pho Ga (Pho with Chicken) and it wasn&#39;t much to write home about. Their Vietnamese coffee is outstanding - both hot and cold. 

Service is very s.l.o.w. so be prepared to wait, especially at lunch time when they fill up. It&#39;s great to see mainly Vietnamese and some Chinese (a friend was able to recognize Mandarin being spoken) folks there, which to me means that the food is pretty darned authentic. However, I am not an authenticity snob (if there is such a phrase) but I do seek flavorful food and I found that at Golden Noodle Bowl House. It isn&#39;t very expensive and I will definitely head here instead of Chez Thuy in Boulder for my Vietnamese food fix."

I&#39;m sure the rest of their menu is delicious, and one day I&#39;ll work through it but for now all of my visits have been for one dish.

Bun Dac Biet is one of my favorite dishes in the summer. When its hot out Pho no longer appeals to me, and yet there is a worthy replacement ready at most Vietnamese restaurants.

Golden Bowl nails it with the perfect proportion of meat, veggies, and noodles in their Combo Bun. Even better, their meat is delicious and their egg rolls lighter than most (which I enjoy). This is the best Bun Dac Biet I&#39;ve had from years eating on Federal, in Boulder, etc.....hail the reigning champion.

Finally, a word for the service - outstanding. While I don&#39;t need great service to be a repeat customer it is refreshing.  As a result this is a great restaurant for those new to Vietnamese, and because of the quality of food its great for exploring beyond pho (enjoyed the Mi Quang, Bun Bo Hue, etc.)

Give the salty lemonade a try too....its fantastic."

Prices are cheap, food is delicious, place is clean and bathroom is clean AND private. 

This place is very very hard to find because its kind of put away at the bottom of some stairs next to a very popular Pho place and Pacific Ocean market. The only issue might be the service because of all the times I&#39;ve been there, our waiter has never spoken english.... proficiently? But honestly it doesn&#39;t matter because they are very friendly, just hard to understand if you have questions. The lady that owns the place or manages it is very good about it though.

I ordered the Pho which is good although Pho isn&#39;t hard to mess up. The prices are better then the Pho places I go downtown. Their Vietnamese egg rolls are something I now crave. 

The service is good as well but make sure you understand Vietnamese food because if you have a lot of questions, you might not get a server who doesn&#39;t understand you.

I was once a loyal customer. I have always order the same food, egg noodles with pork with soup on the side. And there is a lady waitress who always helped me and she knows exactly how I wanted it. Yesterday, I ordered food to go. A male server was helping me as she was busy. I ordered my food and left do some errands. After about 15 min or so, I came back for my order. As I approached the counter to pay my order, the male server asked, &#34;Where is your paperwork?&#34; I am not sure if he was asking me or if he is just talking to himself. I said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; ( Am I suppose to know?) Then he was talking to the lady server in language other than English, and with his gesture, he asked the credit card from my hand. I was confused because I didn&#39;t know how much to pay? Then he said &#34;$9...&#34; I usually looked at the receipt details so see how much the food cost, tax, etc. I thought this time I just let it go as I was tired and hungry. Then he ran my credit card and I signed the receipt that came out from the credit card machine. I didn&#39;t tip him because I only tip dine it orders.  And then I asked for a receipt. He then get very rude to me. He said &#34;It&#39;s too late... why you did you ask earlier...?&#34;. I was annoyed and I told him &#34; I am not happy...&#34; and he said &#34; Whaat...? You want receipt? and then he gave me a blank piece of paper and hand wrote $9&#34; Then the lady waitress came rushing to help me. She printed a receipt for me from the credit card machine with details on it.

I now have to think twice to eat there... I wonder is restaurant business is so bad that tips are expected even for to go orders? I read tips are for dine in. May be next time I should go to Noodles...

BTW, the noodle is missing a sauce..."

The prices are very reasonable, and the service is great. We&#39;ve been here so many times, the owners know us and graciously recommend new things to try ... that&#39;s how I learned about the chicken ga roti and beef cubes. The ambiance is relaxed, and there are plenty of tables.

We got the pork wrap and the steak sandwich. Both are fantastic and so different then the food we normally have. The spices are quite tasty and each bite tasted different. Plantains were also in the pork wrap so that was my favorite.

We ordered a bottle of water and beer along with our meal. Sat down and waited 15 min or more before one of the employees realized we didn&#39;t get our drinks. 
Another couple ordered after us and when the food was ready the girl took it to their table before checking the number. So when the next order was ready they couldn&#39;t figure out who&#39;s it was. Once they did they gave us a sandwich and fries even though we ordered 2 sandwiches and 2 fries. They began to joke about how the other couple didn&#39;t notice they got the wrong order and they weren&#39;t going to say anything to them. God for bid these people had allergies to something! After another 15 min we got the second sandwich but no fries. They neglected to look at our order and see that we had asked for specific no onion and other items on the side. 
My sandwich tasted horrible and my sister said the fries were not good. Also my sister ate her first half of her sandwich and went to the next to find out there was a HAIR in her sandwich! Grossed out she didn&#39;t eat the rest.

I decided to order the Cuban Sandwich (Cubano) and my husband had the Steak Sandwich (Pan con Bistec). We shared the sides, Cuban fries and fried plantains. I was not that impressed with the Cuban sandwich, but it was okay. What made it taste really good though was eating it with the Cuban fries, which was absolutely delicious. It was garlicky and yummy! The plantains helped tame the garlic in our mouths. When I had a bite of my husband&#39;s steak sandwich, however, I flipped. It was really really good, so much better than my Cubano. I will definitely order that next time.

Service wise, we were helped immediately at the order line. There were tables in the patio, but it was raining outside so it was difficult to get a table inside. We were fortunate, however, that a table for 4 became available. Then, we did not wait very long for our food to be served.

The atmosphere inside is a great combination of cultural and casual, with bright colors showcasing that ineffable Latin-Caribbean style and giving the place great energy.

That means that my review is almost exclusively about THE FOOD.

I ordered a minuta de pescado (fish sandwich) and it was oh so good. One trend that I am noticing lately about sandwich places (which is also true here), is that the full size sandwich doesn&#39;t come with sides - you&#39;ve got to order them a la carte. I got the side of sweet plantains, and I am so glad I did because they were great! Hubs got the pan con lechon (pork) as a combinacion, so his was a half-sandwich that came with 2 sides. He chose the beef empanada and Cuban fries, and was mildly disappointed. The Cuban fries were pretty much just regular American shoestring fries, and he was expecting something more special - or at least spicy. The empanada was good, but maybe a little greasy. Hubs let me try each of his foods, and I remember thinking that everything was very good and his sandwich was better than mine. We definitely ate everything, and look forward to coming back for more!"

Food is just as good.  Only thing that brought it down a star was I did a to go order with a side of tostones and there were only 3 small sized ones in my order, seems like I may of got shorted.

However the food itself was mediocre - it lacked a lot of the flavor from the Cuban food I&#39;m used to. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just because they need to tone down the flavors for the clientele, but it&#39;s sad. 

My biggest issue with my experience was the customer service l received. I placed an order for pickup at 3:50pm on a Friday - arrived about 3:58 and proceeded to wait for another 15 minutes for my food. The staff gave me no estimated time of it being ready, and they didn&#39;t apologize for the order being 20 minutes late. To add insult, I was 1 of 3 customers in there at that time and they appeared to be fully staffed. 

For the 4.5 Yelp rating this place has I am very unimpressed."

My wife and I ate here for the first time tonight. I love the standard Cubano sandwich and was excited to try this place. The first thing that struck us looking at the menu was that a sandwich with no side is $8.00.  I looked at my wife and she said it better be a big sandwich for eight bucks. We ordered a Cubano and a pork sandwich, with sweet plantains and plantain chips. When delivered, the size of the sandwiches gave me hope, but, upon inspection it was deceiving as the ingredients inside were let&#39;s say - sparse. The Cubano was roughly a half inch thick and I had trouble finding any pork in the sandwich. It tasted okay, but there was pickle only in about every third bite and I&#39;ve had much better. The pork sandwich, again, tasted okay, but there was little to no meat in the inch and a half on each end of the bread. We split the sandwiches and by the time I ate my half of the pork one, the bottom piece of bread was mush from all the cole slaw juice. I detest soggy bread. 

The sides were okay; and are a better value at $2.50 each. 

Bottom line, the food certainly isn&#39;t bad, but it isn&#39;t anything special and definitely not worth the price.  I don&#39;t think we will be going back any time soon; and I&#39;m concerned for the long-term success of this place if they don&#39;t offer a better value."

It wasn&#39;t able to contain the pork, onions, slaw, and aioli and instead completely fell apart.  The fries were soggy; although, with great flavor.

I ended up ordering the seasonal sandwich (which you can order gluten free for a small surcharge, or a half size). The seasonal sandwich featured eggplant and goat cheese and was tasty! They also have salads and pizza available as well. Prices were fair. I paid $8 for the sandwich.

FIESTA SALAD - $7.10 (half portion)
Our guy recommended this one too. I ordered this b/c the pizza I wanted to order didn&#39;t have meat therefore I wanted meat in my salad - I know, weird. The salad was good but maybe more ordinary tasting than the menu description - it had romaine, roasted corn, black bean salad, radish, avocado, pepper jack cheese, roasted chicken and red pepper vinaigrette. 

BACON CORN PIZZA
Oh wow this was really good. My co-worker ordered this based on our guy&#39;s recommendation - we had also heard about this pizza from one of our co-workers. Pizza had creme fraiche, roasted corn, all-natural, nitrate-free bacon, 3 cheese blend, basil, whole grain dough. Who would guess corn could taste so good on pizza ... well bacon helps too :)

BIANCO - $5.50 (half portion)
This pizza was very good too, with roasted garlic puree, spinach, fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, shaved parm, whole grain dough. Recommended by our guy too. 

Overall great food esp. if you&#39;re trying to eat healthy too. One of my other co-workers got the Green Chicken Chili and said it was very good - just met him during that meal so couldn&#39;t ask if I could have a bite :) Next time I&#39;d like to try the Thai Coconut Salad, Basil Chicken Sandwich, BBQ Pizza and that Green Chicken Chili :) Oh and I want to try their Cane Sugar Sodas too. 

FYI they are located on the far right side of the shopping center, Sprouts is located there too, and they are behind the Red Robin. The Yelp app wrongly directed us to the small strip mall across the street."

It&#39;s a really nice comfortable place, perfect lighting and plenty of seating indoors and out. I also like that it&#39;s not noisy. Great place to meet a friend for a light meal and some good conversation.

They serve at all times of day. I&#39;ve attached photos of all sections of the menu so you can see all the kinds of food they have for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

I had the Tai Coconut salad, large sized. It comes with grated coconut along with peanut mango dressing. None of those flavors came out at all, Still it was a very tasty salad. I especially loved the chicken that came with the salad. It was top quality through and through, the best I&#39;ve had at a place like this.

I think the ordering could have been more clear. After I placed my order, I had not idea what was next...as in how, or where do I pick up my order. I had to ask.

Also the woman who took the order was coughing up a storm. She was trying to cover her cough, but still it was a bit unsettling when she handed me my receipt,  pager, and credit card, since they&#39;d all been coughed on. She was a nice person, but I think she should have let someone take over for her while she was coughing.

They have WiFi, but you have to give your name and email address to access it. No thanks.

I think the prices are in line with other restaurants like this, but I&#39;d say the quality of the food is better."

Plenty of seating indoors and outdoors, perfect to enjoy the weather while sipping the wine while enjoying the fresh food that was prepared just for you.

Parking and trying to get out is somewhat of headache during lunch hours but park bit away so you can get out easily.

When I got there to pick up the order the food was not ready. I patiently waited for the last part of my order to be done and it was the waffle. The fastest thing to fix took the longest and there were maybe 7 people in the restaurant that were already eating there meals. Tried to make up for it by giving me $5 off my next meal. The meal should have been on the house.  When getting to my destination they forgot a good portion of my order and still charged me for it after explaining.

I am fond of businesses that take customer feedback seriously and offer a workable solution. They deserve a second...oops, gotta go; my buzzer is calling me....


More like Modern Fail.

It was my first visit and the website looked enticing. I ordered the flatiron salad with a few modifications, then I was handed my buzzer. Those might be good for Maggiano&#39;s on a packed Saturday night, but for a lunchtime short-order kitchen?? C&#39;mon. 

The next thing I noted was that there really isn&#39;t anywhere to stand in an organized fashion while waiting to get buzzed (in a conventional sense, mind you). The beverage bar is way in the back corner so the traffic pattern is awkward. Acoustics are terrible; this is a very noisy place. If your intent is to meet someone for a lunch conversation, plan on yelling at each other for the duration. Perfect meeting place with the ex-wife.

My salad showed up without my modifications. When I returned it, they said those changes weren&#39;t on the order slip, so the check-in was bad right off. They fixed another salad and this time it showed up without some of the ingredients that were supposed to be in it - and there were a few onions in it, in spite of me deleting that from the order. There really wasn&#39;t a whole lot of concern about customer satisfaction; more like dip into a few bins, toss it on a plate, throw it on a tray and hit the buzzer.

Sorry folks, I&#39;m going back to the Old Fashioned Market."

Let&#39;s be clear. The isn&#39;t a &#34;rest&#34;aurant, it&#39;s a &#34;work&#34;aurant as you shouldn&#39;t plan on getting any kind of service. You order at a counter and then you are on your own. You find your own table, get your own drinks, napkins and even condiments for your table. Then you wait for a buzzer to go off.
And these aren&#39;t fast food prices. 

We were there are at brunch and it was awful. Why offer an egg, bacon or sausage sandwich if you don&#39;t know how to cook eggs or bacon or sausage? The eggs were overlooked, the bacon was soggy and sausage was just plain funky. And the size of the ciabatta bun was way too large for the minimal ingredients inside. We initially tried to resolve this with a trip to the counter for mayo. They had no mayo. So this required surgery (and another trip to the counter for a knife) to make it not be like eating big mouthfuls of bread. I ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes and I&#39;d encourage everyone to pass on these. They were lukewarm, soggy and cut into such large pieces you could not possibly eat one in a bite. 

Then we had to clean up our own table before being on our merry way to Sprouts next door to actually buy lunch. 

Suggestions include having a food runner to deliver food and make sure every customer has what they need to enjoy their dining experience. Put the cutlery out with everything else, so customers can choose which utensils they&#39;d like to enjoy their meal. Offer plain mayo. It&#39;s cheap and makes people happy. Improve your coffee selections and put a little bin there for sugar packets and stirrers (The coffee bar was trashed). Overall, I think you&#39;ve got a decent idea but the execution needs major improvement. 

And I know, many of you could ask why we didn&#39;t complain. Honestly we were so over it and didn&#39;t really see any one obvious to call our disappointment to their attention. Why bother? We left and won&#39;t be back."

Modern industrial sort of feel to the place. Everything seems nice and clean. That&#39;s good.

When you ask for a glass for water you get a nice big glass and not some sort of Dixie cup or thimble. That&#39;s also good. Love that.

My general impression of the breakfast is they mostly stick with the old standbys, eggs to order, bacon, toast etc. So when you take quality ingredients and serve the old favorites, how could you lose? You can&#39;t, and they aren&#39;t.

It&#39;s good. -1 star for undercooked eggs with a lot of runny white."

Modmarket does just that, with farm-to-table style salads (among soups, plates, and pizzas) that actually made my mouth water on my last visit. Huge portions, fresh ingredients, and a decent variety to choose from.

For gluten-free/celiacs, it gets better. The gluten-free pizza swap was surprisingly impressive - I tried GF crust with a white pizza with goat cheese, and it was actually amazing. (Not even for those jaded by the non-wheat world. The boyfriend/avid-bread-eater tried a slice of my GF pizza and proceeded to &#34;wait wow, gluten free, really?&#34; and ate a second slice on me. So I guess that&#39;s high praise.) Salads are obviously generally safe, and at breakfast time there are bread substitutes available.

It&#39;s more expensive than I expected judging by casual seating (I paid around $10 for a personal pizza and $7 for a half-sized salad). But, portions are large and food tastes fresh.

Other highlights include: $2 wine glasses or $6 bottles (for legitimately decent wine), and nutrition labels on the menu that won&#39;t make you wonder why you&#39;re eating here in the first place. In other words, the food is good for you, not just good tasting."

Sure, they have some items that tip you over on half of your day&#39;s calories, but they also have PLENTY of low-calorie, all-natural options.  They print the nutritional information on your receipt, which is nice!

For breakfast, they have yummy coffee.  I like that you can get a real mug, because it makes it feel like a treat!  There&#39;s nothing that is like OMG this is so innovative, but ALL of the breakfast scrambles and plates are solid.  I don&#39;t know much about the sandwiches, because I&#39;m not a sandwich person, but my mom reported that while the ciabatta roll was really yummy, the bread to &#34;fillins&#34; ratio was pretty high.  Maybe too much bread?  That&#39;s a preference though, as they are still very tasty.  I can&#39;t forget the WAFFLES.  The Apple Pear Waffle is like eating dessert for breakfast, which I have absolutely no problem with!!! 

For lunch or dinner me and my love like to split a pizza and a salad.  I like the fiesta, thai coconut, superfood and FLATIRON salads....steak and potatoes in a salad makes it so hearty and you feel super satisfied. 

The pizzas are solid.  A thin-crust, wood-fired, delicious, authentic-type pizza.  Honey on the crust is delicious.  

Sorry I can&#39;t talk about the sandwiches...but everything else is delish,so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be good too.

The Wintergreen Salad is my favorite! The mixture of dates, tiny potatoes and the most yummy salad dressing is just perfect. If you add tofu to the small size of this salad you will be really full but not that weighted down, need a nap kind of full (which is good for going back to work). 

The cashiers are usually great except for the last time I was here and my water glass was filled with some sort of pink food residue. I handed it back to the cashier and asked her if she could replace it with the clean one. She shot back that it was &#34;just condensation not dirty&#34;...yes i know there was ALSO condensation on the glass but also pink food chunks...gross! I know she was busy as it was the lunch time rush but a single glance at the cup would have been sufficient to see the chunks.

It looked like someone prepared a half sandwich but didn&#39;t cut the other half of empty bread.

A handy BOGO coupon came in the mail again and since funds are low, I decided to try this place for dinner.  Shared an entree salad and sandwich for $10 plus tip. Thanks Mod Market!!!

The THAI CURRY CHICKEN SALAD was delicious and I especially loved the shredded sweet potato.  The dressing was perfect, not too much and it lended a delicately sweet yet tangy bite to the wonderful ingredients in the salad.

The BASIL CHICKEN SANDWICH  was also amazing.  Made with fresh basil and an aioli instead of pesto, this knocked the sandwich up a few stars.  Plus once I got to the end I was left with some bread and no sandwich filling....BUT that was more fine as the Ciabatta was to die for. As good as the best Italian bakeries.  I wanted a whole other piece of just the bread! 

Employees at the ordering counter were super friendly and made excellent recommendations.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more of the menu!

By the way, I am still confused on how to tip at these types of restaurants. I usually tip 10% and I hope this is acceptable.  It&#39;s not a traditional QSR like Chipotle (where tips are voluntary) so there should be a standard. If anyone has feedback, please send me a comment.

My go-to is the Rocket Egg breakfast sandwich (eggs, arugula, basil aioli, provolone, and tomato on ciabatta bread). It&#39;s on fleek.  

I also like that this place lists the calories of what you order on your receipt!  Trying to be health conscious can be difficult when you go out to eat.  But this place gives you lots of health options to stay on track.

For dinner, they offer some great wine specials (glasses starting at $2)!  The entrees are a good size and will leave you feeling full (not overly stuffed and uncomfortable). 

Another cool thing they do is offer 10% off your next visit if you save your receipt!  It&#39;s only good for a limited time after the purchase date, so check the details on the back.

Calina opted for the Steak Plate and you can choose two sides for this one. She chose the Coconut Citrus Soba and Arugula Salad. She also got a cup of the Chicken Green Chili Soup and a glass of wine.

Anthony took our order and he was very professional, efficient and friendly. It came out within 5 minutes. Portions were a good size and everything was fresh and just right.

Had a great dinner and the prices were pretty reasonable for this Fast-Casual restaurant with really fresh ingredients.

The receipt shows the nutritional values of the items along with the caloric content. On the back of the receipt if you come back within a week, you get 10% of your order or you can opt to get the 10% Yelp Discount when you check-in.

You can pay with credit card but they only accept cash tips. Didn&#39;t have a problem with parking but it probably does get a little hectic to find parking if you go earlier in the day for the lunch or regular dinner hour.

You can also share a photo of your food on social media with the tag #modmarket and get entered into their weekly free meal drawing. You can also sign-up to receive emails with discounts and specials."

Fresh veggies and sides. The sandwiches are a reasonable portion for one person. This is my son&#39;s favorite pizza in in the area (mine is Marco&#39;s). I love that they have fountain natural sodas!!! (I rarely drink soda but when I do it&#39;s not full of HFCS). They also have craft beer which makes the Dr happy. Bottom line: You can leave MM full, happy and not hating yourself. 

The parking can be painful so I say just park in the large lot on Arapahoe and add a few steps to your total for the day. The parking closer is just a mess of distracted people driving enormous SUVs or idiots in sports cars that think life is a video game."

I went in during &#34;off&#34; hours, just before dinnertime around 4:30-ish.There is outdoor seating which begins close to the front door and wraps around the corner with a decent view of the front range on the southwest side of the building. I opted to eat inside since I had been outside all day in the warm sun. The cool air felt great. Not many diners inside, the majority of the customers were dining outside. Many of the tables (about half of the tables) in the large dining area were not cleaned off.  It was not filthy by any means but it was apparent that many tables had been dined on and not wiped off.

The young lady that took my order was happy and pleasant.  In fact, all of the employees I had contact with seemed nice. 

There is no table service. Orders are placed at the counter, a beeper is provided which alerts diners that their order is ready to pick up at another counter. Diners bus their own table when done. I was glad that real plates and flat ware are provided. Not paper and plastic.

I heard good things about the pizza and so ordered a half Margarita. The pizza WAS delicious and just the way I like. Very thin crust, fresh mozzarella with red sauce and some basil sprinkled on top. I do not like a ton of cheese on pizza but I do like a bit of cheese with great flavor. This pizza delivered on all fronts. I&#39;d definitely come back for the pizza and possibly try some of the other menu items."

I love their healthy menu options.  I love the decor and beetle-kill pine accents.  I appreciate the &#34;open&#34; kitchen to see your food being prepared. Which makes me disappointed I have to leave a review like this:
As I was waiting for my food to be prepared I witnessed an employee behind the counter touching his beard and mouth. Right after he began to hand-toss the pizza dough. He was not wearing gloves, and didn&#39;t washed his hands before preparing the pizza dough.

It was right before dinner time, slow and quiet.  I rarely visit MM at a busy time.  The dishes in the dish bin near the garbage and recycling were stacked up, needing to be removed. I have noticed this several times, in my multiple visits, along with dirty tables and floors. 

After witnessing the food prep, I am hesitant to go back to Mod Market. I want to be comfortable eating my food. Knowing it was prepared with clean hands and care."

The food is fresh and they are open to variations on their menu items.  The superfood salad, I have had three times (twice at DIA).  (Once superfood salad at DIA the currants in the quinoa mix had some sediment on them which made the salad gritty and then inedible.)   We have also had the tomato and arugula sandwich, a kids tomato and cheese sandwich, and pizza.  All of which were delicious.

The dining area is decorated nicely and surrounded by windows.  The tables and chairs are pretty close together, so those selfish and rude parents that insist upon bringing strollers into restaurants make it very difficult to move around or they will hit you, your table, or your chair - this has happened every time now.

I didn&#39;t give it five stars because the menu is confusing and the food takes a while to get to you."

This phenomenon leaves Modmarket PACKED at lunch time, ruining it&#39;s atmosphere a bit. But there is a way around this to enjoy the many delicious options that have to offer. 

For a decent price, you can get a filling lunch and all of the caloric information you require IF you go before 11:15 or after 1 PM. If not, I&#39;m sorry to say, this place does not meet the coveted 5-star ranking when swarms of business people are fighting over the few available seating options. If you go early, or take your to go, you can find solace in the pizzas, sandwiches, salads and Izze Soda. Do yourself a favor and get a half and half, where you can enjoy multiple food options on the same plate.

This is the best food you can get in the DTC, sadly everyone else knows that too. Beware."

Pretty much going to be my new favorite lunch spot with my coworkers!!
It&#39;s basically salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and chicken/steak plates... And everything is pretty healthy. They even have the nutritional info printed on the receipts!! 

I tried he flatiron steak salad and it was DELICIOUS. The grilled onions added such a great flavor to the salad!! I ordered the full plate, but it was kinda too big, so I&#39;m probably going to do half order next time. All the other salads  sound pretty amazing and I can&#39;t wait to try them all. I think I&#39;ll switch off from salads and sandwiches until I&#39;ve tried everything on the menu hahaha.

It was super fast, and I also heard you can call in your order and do a pick up if you have short lunches. I&#39;ll probably have to do that in most cases.

The menu will make a decisive person indecisive, so come armed with patience for yourself or your fellow diners. The Thai Chicken salad and sandwich were both calling to me, and I ultimately went for the salad because it had sweet potato. Great decision - it was delish!

Friend raved about her Flatiron salad and Green Chili soup. The sodas are yummy, too - even if you don&#39;t normally drink it (I don&#39;t). They serve cane sugar sodas. I had a sip, and it was nice.

I can tell that during the busy hours it seems the portions get smaller, which is odd bc I see them weigh the meat but the salad lettuce portion always seems larger at off hours.   They could use to put a tray station outside and invest in more trays and soup cups as a whole.  I have been there multiple times and bringing your tray back inside after sitting outside can get annoying with the crowd (some people resort to them just leaving it and hogging a table for other guests) and I have also seen them run out of dining in bowls/cups for soup and serve soup for here orders in to-go containers, this is an unnecessary waste of material.

We got the superfood salad with champagne dressing, Bianco and prosciutto pizza.  The salad was well balanced.  A little dressing goes a long way.

Service, however, was bad at this location (Greenwood village).

We went across the street and had a delicious lunch sandwich at Einstein Bros. 

Could use some improvement in the staff attitude. 

My food was served on a tray that had some sort of bits of napkin left on it.. Not a big deal but a little off-putting. The containers that held coffee accessories like travelling lids looked like they needed to be cleaned as well, there were bits/grains of something in the bottom.

It&#39;s nice to have the pager so you don&#39;t have to wait to get your food. The salad was good although the salmon was overcooked. The rest of it consisted of mixed greens, hard boiled eggs, fingerling potatoes, onions &amp; Kalamatta olives.

Having not been in before, we were a bit deer in the headlights. I opted for the special sandwich of roasted sweet potato, red pepper, tomato and greens on multi grain bread. The cashier asked if I wanted half or whole. She explained the sandwich as being much bigger and thicker than it was in reality. Because of her description I decided to go with the half. Which two hours later was definitely not enough food to last through the afternoon.

The first time I went here, I wasn&#39;t feeling like my stomach could handle anything. So, I just got a half salad, which was perfect.

Today, I go for the salads. Sure, they have sandwiches, pizzas, some home style meals, but I always go for the salads. My favorites are the Farmer, the Winter Green, and the seasonal Beet salad, which I have been favoring since it&#39;s only seasonal.

Come early or come later, because this place is packed at lunch time. Dinner time is a bit better.

Back to the health issue, their receipts and menus list nutrition information so you can tailor your order to your diet."

I had a cup of the green chicken chili soup and a half salad. You can make your own salad with 5 toppings. 
They have an agave herbs dressing that is absolutely delicious! Coming here did not make me feel like I was lacking as far as what was on their menu and having to order it &#34;Paleo style&#34;.
Some places you go into while on the Paleo diet and you can&#39;t stop starring at the people around you and what THEY ordered that seams so much better than the veggies on your plate. I felt like everyone was wishing they had ordered what I had this time!
Note: the dressing was SO good that my husband wanted to lick his plate clean! I of course didn&#39;t let him. 
The 10% off coupon was a nice treat too!
We will definitely be back again!"

I&#39;m not a salad person, but if you put enough yummy ingredients on top of the lettuce I&#39;ll start to forget I&#39;m eating a salad at all. Modmarket salads are piled high with healthy veggies, meat, and tasty sauces. Get the large portion and try to save half for dinner (warning: you might fail). 

Most recently I tried one of their pizzas, which was also topped with fresh ingredients and featured a thin, slightly charred crust. 

The service is uber friendly, and you always get a coupon on your receipt for 10% off your next order. 

Be prepared for a long line during lunch and to be served up fresh, delicious, and healthy food. 

Oh, they serve brunch too? Ok, if I must..."

If you don&#39;t want to stand in a line a mile long, get here between 11-11:30a. The space is big(ish) and bright with a good amount of tables.  Everything on the their menu is very heathy, fresh and it is a good option for those who need gluten free of vegan.  

I opted for the farmer salad, entree size.  I was full of fresh mixed greens, corn, feta, a nice amount of chicken, grapes and a balsamic vinagrette.  It was well made and tasty.  It was also $10, which seems to be the going rate for counter service decent salads.

I&#39;ve had a few things here... I like their soups because they are tasty yet not over salted like so many other places. I thought the green chicken chili was on the money and really makes me want to come back for me but the cashew butternut was also very good.

I had the arugula mozz, which I&#39;m a sucker for, but when it&#39;s prepared like this it&#39;s hard not to love it. I had the thai chicken as well, which gives you some strongly flavors in cilantro and mint, elements you find in sandwiches like the Vietnamese bahn mi.

This place is always hopping during lunch but they move the line pretty quickly so the wait isn&#39;t too bad. With that said, if you&#39;re in a rush then you probably shouldn&#39;t come here but if you have a decent lunch hour then I would highly recommend it."

But then I won a $25 gift card to Mod Market and decided to take my chance by going at night and I must have the golden touch because this place is near empty compared to what it&#39;s like at lunch.  And what do you know? It&#39;s fabulous!

A bit pricey for my blood but if you&#39;re looking to eat healthy and have some extra bills sitting around, this place is for you. Love that they have a variety of items ranging from organic to gluten free to vegetarian and in the end, I went with the fall cobb salad and goat pizza combo. I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t have publish the price on the menu though, which is a tad annoying since I&#39;m a girl on a budget. It turned out to be about $12 for the combo which isn&#39;t horrible but again, I would have liked to have known beforehand how much it was costing me. Then I was surprised by the $2 wine they offer--you can&#39;t get $2 wine anywhere! But the best surprise of all was seeing the receipt--they print out all the items along with nutritional content of everything. I have never seen that before and thought it was one of the coolest things ever!

We sat down and were soon buzzed to go pick up our food. You get it on an old school metal tray then feast your heart out. The fall cobb dressing was comparable to Outback&#39;s Caesar dressing and love that they added it on (my boo didn&#39;t like his salad being doused in salad dressing though, you say tomato, I say tomaaahto). The pizza was thin, crispy and loaded with goat cheese which made my goat cheese loving self smile. Add that along with the funky yet simple wood and metal décor that is dare I say, mod, and friendly staff and this place is a winner......as long as I keep getting bonuses at work that is."

We needed a quick meal to pick up, but it had to be healthy and delicious.  ModMarket is THE place to go.  Local, sustainable ingredients are featured on the menu, along with a detailed description of what goes into each dish.  For me, this is priceless, as I am slightly picky.  ModMarket goes the extra mile to make sure many diets can be easily followed - gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, but also has hormone and anti-biotic-free meats, for my carnivorous self.  

I really wanted to sit outside on the patio and soak in the sun, but we had other things to do (I&#39;ll be back to sit here!).  The inside is spacious and trendy and completely inviting.  And the service is so friendly.  We must have looked &#34;new,&#34; as the kind girl behind the counter explained the menu and concept to us and offered up her suggestions.  She gave us real water glasses to get water while we waited.  It&#39;s the small touches that really elevate a restaurant to 5 stars. 

The food was ready quickly.  Why on earth would you choose to eat at a fast food chain when this place is easily accessible?  I had a cup of the green chicken chili; it was well flavored with chunks of tender chicken suspended in a green chili sauce.  Delicious!  I then had the Thai Coconut salad.  They offer half sizes, I chose the full, and easily have lunch left over for tomorrow.  The chicken was cooked just right, still juicy.  The mixed greens were fresh, the cucumbers crisp, and the roasted sweet potato and coconut really added to the flavors of the salad.  The dressing is peanut mango, a creamy blend of textures and flavors that really tied the salad together.  My husband had the BBQ pizza and enjoyed it as well.  The crust was nicely cooked, thin and whispey.  

This is my new go-to spot!"

The location can be chaotic to park, then you can guarantee to find a line if you get there even one minute after 11:30.  The line does move relatively fast though.  And there is minimal awkward standing around for your food as they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready to be picked up from the open kitchen.

The space is modern and open.  It can get pretty noisy inside and they&#39;ve crammed as many tables as possible in there, but they do have outdoor seating which I am quick to take advantage of when weather permits.

The food here is solid.  Good flavors, lots of options, and absolutely fresh and wholesome.  I feel ok about eating out, from a health conscious standpoint, since the ingredients are what I&#39;d choose to eat at home and the nutritional information leaves no doubt about what I&#39;m about to consume.  I love that you can order half sandwich/ half pizza/ half salad combos.  I like variety in my meals!

It is on the pricey side, approaching $15/person including a drink, but I do feel this is a situation of you get what you pay for- if you want a $5 sandwich, go ahead with your foot long with creepy meat by-product sandwiches topped with limp lettuce and day old tomato slices.  But if you want to really taste freshness, and feel good about your meal choices then this is the place for you."

The steak sandwich I had was very fresh, but a bit bland in seasoning and pricy for just a sandwich with no side. The pizza I had though was delicious and a good deal at like $7. Probably the best thing though was their chipotle breakfast sandwich. It was HUGE (2 eggs, bacon, cheese, ciabatta bread, chipotle sauce) and perhaps one of the tastiest breakfast sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had. And for $6.50, I think it&#39;s certainly worth it.

Prices and value certainly vary, but you definitely know you&#39;re getting something fresh and healthier. I love that they print out the nutritional data of your purchase, and that coupons are usually on there as well (we used one for buy-one-get-one breakfast). Thus, I&#39;m definitely a fan and wish more places would follow suit with healthier items and info on what you ordered."

They are extremely packed at lunch time during the week. We got here right at 11:30 and must&#39;ve lucked out because by the time we got our food the line was wrapped around the front of the restaurant.

I&#39;m going for healthier fare these days and Modmarket definitely has good options. I got the Caesar Salad, which had a good blend of veggies and the dressing was very good. I&#39;m not a cucumber fan so I slid all those over to my wife&#39;s plate, but everything else was good and fresh and the chicken was cooked just right.

I got the root beer natural soda and that&#39;s definitely a sugar kick to the teeth, but in a good way. I had to stop myself from getting more than 1 refill :)"

Loved the decor, the vibe and especially the freakingly delicious tapas and drinks.

P.S. I didn&#39;t take any pictures because the food was so good it didn&#39;t last too long on the plate!

We came for happy hour and it was rather pricey. If you order any cocktails off the regular menu they are about $12 a piece. It was $7 for a glass for my happy hour house white wine which I also thought was steep. Am I in Vegas? I think for the area if you are looking for a happy hour deal there may be better finds price wise. Or I could just be a cheapskate... who knows!"

It was not bad at all, it just was not over the top worth the drive experience.  With so many up and coming restaurants and bars near our home, I think businesses have to do their best to shine or they lose business. Again, it was not bad at all, just not memorable.  But if I lived in the area, i would come back for their happy hour.  

When we arrived there were many open seats, so we got to sit wherever we wanted. They were playing a variety of music and it was not too loud.  People are not dressed up, everyone is in jeans and a t-shirt.  It&#39;s a very casual dining experience, we were on a date so we were a bit dressed up.  Our waitress was very kind and suggested a few drinks for us.  The menu is quite small and simple, but that is a good thing too.  They have a variety of cocktails for around $9-$12 and I got a margarita which was not too bad. I love margaritas and found most places don&#39;t know how to knock it out of the park. The best one I ever had was at a restaurant called Los Arcos.  We tried the burrata and enjoyed it.  The cheese is very smooth and creamy. It came with bread and pesto sauce for happy hour it was $7 and it pairs well with many beverages.  I enjoyed my drinks and so did my husband.

First, the drink menu. It has a little bit of everything, but the beer and wine selection in particular were very basic. I understand the concept of keeping things simple but this was pretty extreme. 

Second, food. We weren&#39;t super hungry, but ordered a few small plates. As others have noted, the buratta was excellent. However, everything else was mediocre. The flatbread was particularly bland; the texture of the carrots was off-putting. I mostly just couldn&#39;t figure out what the theme was here - there&#39;s pasta, and a burger, and many people keep referring to &#34;tapas&#34; but outside of the croquettes there&#39;s nothing here that&#39;s even vaguely Spanish. It was just...confusing. My date noted that it felt like the room service menu in a mid-tier hotel, trying to appeal to everyone who might possibly pass through.

That said, the location is nice, good ambiance, lovely staff. I&#39;m giving them three stars because they&#39;re still new and I think that a more curated menu could work here."

We got some free drink tickets from our gym, and we ventured in last night to check it out. First of all, they allowed us to get ANY drink with those tickets, regardless of price, which was the first sign these guys are here to please. We got some nice chardonnay and ordered the Burrata. 

For those of you who are Burrata virgins, I implore you to come here and give it a try. It&#39;s basically mozzarella cheese and cream fused together. It&#39;s served with a beautiful pesto, and grilled french bread with olive oil. To die for. We then switched to red wine and got the olives and nuts appetizer. This is basically walnuts with olive oil and fresh rosemary, spanish olives on the side of that. Great snacks. 

We didn&#39;t end up having dinner there last night, but will be back. The menu is mostly small plates and apps, so don&#39;t expect a ton of entree options - wine and cocktails are impressive. Regardless, Blueprint is an excellent addition to the 17th street row.

I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the best meal we&#39;ve had in Denver to date (granted, we tend to stay in our little downtown/Uptown bubble).  As others have mentioned, this used to be Caveau, and ugh, this is so much better!  

The vibe is super classy, and trendy, but not pretentious. It&#39;s bright, spacious, and the staff wears blue t-shirts and jeans, and is super friendly!  We went during the early dinner hour, but after happy hour, and did not have to wait at all.  We got a table in the middle of the restaurant and even with my scooter and BFs wheelchair, we did not feel like we were in the way of everyone, or taking up the entire space.

We began with drinks, and I had the Kombucha Cosmo, which was delicious, and so unique.  It had a lavender sugar rim, which was a great touch.  The drinks are also very reasonably priced! 

We then had the oysters (my first time, and being from Maine, I know this is shameful).  They were a little pricey... but again, being landlocked is new to me.   I thought they were delicious and the horseradish, lemon, and spicy cocktail sauce are perfect additions.  We then had the Burrata small plate, the bf had the steak, and I had the INCREDIBLE homemade seasonal pasta, which was mushroom ravioli in a garlic herb sauce.  BF ate the steak in 3 bites, as it was a small portion, but everything was delicious and we cleaned all of our plates.  I loved that the pasta was not in a thick cream sauce, or an unrealistic portion.  Literally, the best.

I was too full to enjoy a full dessert, but the BF had the chocolate tart, which was incredibly rich, and came with black pepper whipped cream.  

Basically, I cannot wait to come back here, for brunch, and happy hour.  We may even be treating my family to a dinner here as out of towners!  Welcome to neighborhood BluePrint :)"

- I came with two adults and an almost three year old the first visit. The staff was amazing with the three year old. #HeartMelting 5 stars for loving on our little man!
- The food is small plates; we did it tapas style and shared them. The Roasted Baby Beets dish was good, although, I would prefer goat cheese over the cotija. The Burrata made me moist. It was like foreplay. The Hangar Steak was yummy. We had plenty more, but those were my two favorites. 
- Drinks: I tried the Turn Up the Beet, Aviation and Huck + Herb. The Beet drink wasn&#39;t for me, but that may just be me. The Aviation I wanted to love, but I found it incredibly unbalanced regarding the flavor and/or mixing of ingredients. I don&#39;t know if it was an off night or just the recipe at fault. I would avoid it! I&#39;m from Chicago and admit I&#39;m used to amazing mixologists. AKA-I&#39;m used to the best. I&#39;m gonna give them more time to get the drinks right. The drink I did enjoy was the Huck + Herb, which had a great balanced flavor that made my mouth happy. 1 out of 3 drinks though was a bit of a bummer. If this changes, they will have 5 stars! Perfecting your drinks at a bar is a necessity. 
-The music selection was ALL music I love, and I may have been singing and dancing to it with the little guy, but it was too loud for having conversations over dinner. We had to keep leaning in to hear each other at a four seater table on a Thursday night. Keep the music selection, just turn it down a tad. ;) 

That being said, YOU SHOULD CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! I&#39;m a fan! They need to make some tweaks, but they are new and hopefully listening to feedback."

We tried the beet cocktail and the mescal watermelon drink. Both were complex, delicious, and not overly sweet. The burrata and Brussels sprouts/hummus were incredible. For our second round, we stayed traditional with an old fashioned and sazerac. The bartender certainly knows what she is doing. Cocktail prices are very reasonable for the quality of the drinks. Definitely recommend."

* Service was great! Very friendly, quick, attentive.

CONS:
Can&#39;t think of any!

My girlfriend and I shared a handful of plates. The burrata was phenomenal; we agreed it was some of the best we&#39;d ever had. The croquettes were delicious and rich as you would expect. The fresh pasta tasted very fresh and we really enjoyed it. We also had the caesar and it was quite good. 

For wine, we did the Chenin Blanc which was very good and quite reasonably priced. 

Our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. He was busy but we never felt neglected. We agreed that for a restaurant that had just opened, it was run incredibly well and we definitely look forward to returning to try more of the menu!"

Walked in just after 10pm last night with some friends. We were all hungry and excited to be there.  It was almost empty, and the guy working the front area said curtly, &#34;kitchen&#39;s closed, we&#39;re not serving food anymore.&#34; Since we had come specifically for some late night snacks and drinks, and their tempting food menu had been prominently displayed on a stand outside, we turned right around and left, telling the server/host we were sorry to leave. &#34;Yeah, have fun eating shitty food across the street!&#34; he said as we walked out.  Wow. What a horrible way to make a first impression. What an unprofessional thing to say to potential customers. Blueprint, your employee just guaranteed that neither I nor any of my friends will ever come back, with that awful attitude. I was so sorry to see Caveau close, and I&#39;d been so happy that there was something new in this space. I can&#39;t tell you how disappointed it makes me, especially after reading other good reviews, to say that I won&#39;t be coming here ever again, but I just won&#39;t be disrespected like that, and the restaurants and businesses on 17th deserve a more cordial, polite, professional, and gracious neighbor than the tacky behavior that was displayed by your server last night. It&#39;s really too bad, such a shame. I wish you the best of luck staying open when your kitchen closes at 10 on a Friday night and your employees are rude and snarky. Caveau, come back!"

Using trusty yelp I came across Cinna Box, and couple that with love of cinnamon rolls, I couldn&#39;t resist. 

Cinna Box is a cozy little cafe style eatery run by a sweet couple. The atmosphere for me that day was welcoming and warm, and the aroma of the freshly baked delicacies was filling the air. Upon perusing the menu, it was refreshing to see a small selection rather than the smorgasbord of choices you often see when a place hasn&#39;t found their niche.

I settled on trying the special strawberry streusel bun, cream cheese filled bun, and the bacon Gouda quiche. I&#39;m getting long-winded here so let&#39;s cut to the chase:

Strawberry streusel was covered in freshly macerated strawberries and a wonderful cream. The bun itself was still that gooey consistency you seek while having a crisp bottom crust. It was delicious and my kids devoured it like wild animals!

Cream cheese filled bun was a more classical presentation, covered in creamy and simply delicious. Again very consistent gooey inside but not too chewy. The cream was delightful and very rich. I couldn&#39;t stop sneaking little bites while pretending to divvy it up.

Finally the bacon Gouda quiche. Simply amazing. Smooth fluffy eggs with big chunks of bacon throughout. The Gouda was a nice play of flavors and the cook on the quiche was perfect.  

All said, I would really recommend giving Cinna Box a try. They are perfecting their recipe and we are all lucky to be the recipients of their amazing effort.

We had a great conversation with Sam. She told us they do 2 bakings. one morning and one afternoon. She described what she had, and told us with what ingredients were in it. Its nice to know that we don&#39;t have to travel to Boulder or Cherry Creek to get bakery products that are organic and fresh. Sam also told us the cherries that were on one of the cinnamon buns were picked from Berry Patch Farms the day before. I love Berry Patch Farms and she also told us that next weekend they will have black raspberries. Yum! They also use Kerigold butter which we love. 

When Sam was explaining everything to us we could definitely see the passion that goes into what they do there. A day later we had the cinnamon buns. 10 seconds in  a microwave, cause who doesn&#39;t want warm buns?, and they tasted fantastic. Yesterday I had a rocky road chocolate cookie and a cherry hand pie. My husband and I shared them, and the handmade crust on the cherry pie was amazing. The chocolate cookie was so moist it fell apart when I picked it up. 

Its wonderful and dangerous to have this gem of a bakery in our area. They also do quiche which we will go back for. Oh yeah, almost forgot. they make doggie treats!"

After a spicy breakfast burrito something sweet always sounds good so I decided to check it out. I was greeted by a nice young man who seemed to be the proprietor and he  gave me a quick rundown of his baked goods. 

I chose a palisade peach cream cheese cinnamon roll and a small coffee. The roll was both unique and very good, my only regret was I ordered the mini instead of regular size. The coffee was good as well although I bet most of you would have preferred it hotter.

I grabbed a Rocky Road cookie to go before leaving to have later, but it was so good it didn&#39;t last 30 minutes.

I hope you&#39;ll stop by and give this place and this young man a chance. I think we need to support locally owned small businesses like this.

To top it off, we&#39;ve had the most delicious, flakey quiches each time: yaass! We also tried the salty caramel pecan and original cinnamon roll.

Honestly, just give me the toppings on a plate, and I&#39;ll be happy. The roll itself needs a little more work. The lemon vanilla topping is unique and worth trying.

The owner is simply delightful. She and her boyfriend run the shop and she&#39;s really a nice person to chat with. 
The food: had two different kinds of cinnamon rolls - had the minis. Salted caramel and original. Both very good. My only criticism would be that they&#39;re a bit sweet. I don&#39;t like dry, unsweetened cinnamon rolls, but these were a tad too sweet. Primarily in the frosting, particularly with the original. The salted caramel were nice - good combo with the sweet and the salt.
Chocolate chip cookie was also quite tasty. 
I&#39;ll be going back when I get a chance.
It would be nice if they expanded their offerings a bit to things like cinnamon bread or even really good French bread, or something, as the bakery is there and they&#39;re no longer in their food-truck, relying on a commissary. It is a small, young business, so I understand not wanting to have too much product, and wasting product. Maybe when their following expands.
Could use a bit more advertising, however. I only found it by accident through Yelp.
The cafe/eating area is sweet, too. Can&#39;t renege if they have beverages to go with the food, but maybe that&#39;ll be in the future too?"

Early morning and the place was a little slow BUT the owner was still very upbeat and polite he took the time to tell us about his dream of a 24 hour healthy fast food restaurant  (hopefully in the near future) lol. He showed us each roll that he had that morning and they all looked amazing we went with a cream cheese and salted caramel both were very good just the right amount of sweet.

This is one of those very rare kind of places where the owner is very passionate about what they do and it is very obvious in the quality of service and food. The owners are very involved in what they do, they prepare, cook, and manage the business on top of personally ringing up customers at the counter. You can see the pride they have as they list the rolls they have available that day.

Original: My fiancée stopped in here after an oil change and got a cinnamon roll, a mini blueberry pie and a muffin. The blueberry pie was amazing and we haven&#39;t stopped obsessing over it. Today, I finally went in to see what they were all about. A friend and I ordered the bacon Gouda quiche and a salted caramel cinnamon roll. I couldn&#39;t recommend them more highly. The salted caramel was fantastic and we look forward to making this place a staple. I only wish they had a menu so we could have picked up orders for our friends at work as well. I was thinking their offering likely changes which is why they don&#39;t carry a menu- but even something like Monday: Bacon Gouda quiche &amp; lemon cinnamon roll. Tuesday: spinach quiche and salted caramel, etc. some sort of rotating menu would even be fine. We would have been able to come pick up food for our office if they knew what was available!

When I got home my roll wasn&#39;t even warm and the frosting was not melted at all so it clearly wasn&#39;t warm at all, even when she first put on the frosting. The lemon in the frosting is an interesting twist that I liked. The roll itself wasn&#39;t especially tasty or all that soft and gooey like you would expect. I probably won&#39;t be back. The ONLY reason I would go back is if I was REALLY craving a cinnamon roll because there aren&#39;t any Cinnabon locations even remotely close to me. They also don&#39;t even have a cash register and use a phone to process credit card purchases.

This place is great. The owner here is amazing. He cares a ton about his customers. He has terrific reviews on Yelp, and he deserves each and every one of them.

This is a small little place, but I love the atmosphere of it. 

I got the Mile High Dog. A 100% Kobe/Wagyu Beef Dog, topped with thin sliced rare roast beef. It also contained pickles, sport peppers, and a homemade horseradish sauce. I also got Fries and a Drink.

The fries are incredible. I don&#39;t know what it is about them. They are fresh cut potatoes, but they almost taste even fresher than anything I&#39;ve had before. He offered a side of ranch with them. Highly recommended.

The dog itself. WOW! The meat was plump and juicy. The roast beef complimented it well. The peppers and pickles gave it some nice sweetness and heat. Finally, the horseradish gave it a nice creaminess to tie it all together. Nothing overpowered anything in this meal. That was the perfect hot dog.

I came by myself, but I am definitely coming back to share this gem with my friends and family. I love about 10 minutes from here, and this may be my new favorite place in that radius. Well done."

I got the Windy City dog with tots and BF got the chili pie dog and fries. We both got the jalapeno ranch for dipping - YUM. Dogs were great - best Chicago dog I&#39;ve had in a long, long time. BF dug the chili pie dog too.

Awesome place."

I&#39;m not sure if others are answering Ed&#39;s cry for a hot dog revolution but he is certainly helping lead the way. So far I have tried the brisket dog, the fried pickle dog, the Texas temptation and the surf n turf. All have been wonderful, Ed and his staff are truly doing great work in back. The brisket is moist with a sweet bbq while the slaw provides just a bit of heat to make things interesting. The fried pickle dog and surf n turf are unique experiences that will tickle your taste buds with something slightly different than they&#39;re used to. The Texas Temptation withthe fired onions, pepers and avocado, currently a special, is becoming my go to dog so I recommend you run in to get one before it&#39;s gone! 

Ed himself is very fun and detail oriented, he&#39;s going to try to break you out of your shell making your experience at Harely&#39;s something more than just walking up to the counter and ordering a dog. If you like something spicy ask who mixed the hot ketchup (the name escapes me now, devil&#39;s fire?). If Ed mixed it himself it&#39;s going to be properly spicy, otherwise it&#39;s more toned down. Either way it goes great with some tots. 

The restaurant is clean, when Ed isn&#39;t taking orders he&#39;s out front making sure everything is in order and people are enjoying themselves. You have a couple of TVs to watch football on while you enjoy your dog or simply get a small chuckle from Ed&#39;s humor shown in the motivational signs he has up. 

So why not a perfect 5 stars from me? I clearly like the place. Well it simply comes down to a certain lack of variety. Sure, Ed has a lot of different things he will throw on your dog in various combinations but at the end of it all is the actual sausage you&#39;re getting, while good, can become boring. I&#39;d like to see a wider variety of sausages mixed in; Elk, rattlesnake and rabbit, a spicy bison brat come immediately to mind. I feel as though I&#39;m already exhausting the menu which will probably move me from a once or twice a week customer to a once a month customer. Still great food, just a bit narrow despite the variety of toppings."

No gluten free buns but I&#39;m sure Ed might work on that! I loved my Windy City dog was good! On a bed of lettuce and I side of potato strings that were killer! I overall appreciated the service!

Being a fan of Mediterranean food, I got the Toga Dog with &#34;Greek&#34; toppings on the hot dog. It ended up being one of the best hot dogs I&#39;ve ever had (right next to Iceland&#39;s). You also can&#39;t go wrong with the sides whether you get fries or something else. To make the experience better, the owner was very humorous and made the effort to get to know us. The service was quick, tables were clean, and decorations were fun! Overall, I highly recommend this place for lunch!"

My friend and I were coming back from a long day of physical activity from the beautiful Colorado outdoors and happened to stumble across this place. We were extremely delighted at how delicious everything was. Get the taters too. Ahhh! So good. 

I got the BBQ Brisket Dog and it was incredible. As a former Los Angeles resident, I&#39;ve been to Pink&#39;s which always has lines that stretch across the block. I would say this is way better and so underrated, which for some strange reason, makes it taste even more glorious."

Immediately met Ed, who was incredibly helpful at suggesting what to get. Ed went through the motions of explaining his joint, about how he makes everything, which I thought was pretty impressive. He was aware of his good standing on yelp, since he inquired on how we heard about his place, and I was drawn in by how tasty it all looked. 

Upon arriving, I already knew I really wanted to try his fried pickles, I mean, just check out the pictures! My boyfriend and I, ended up choosing between two, which I unfortunately forgot their names! His hot dog reminded me a bit like a Cuban sandwich, while mine was similar to that of a gyro. We ended up getting meals, which Ed was so kind enough to give my boyfriend his sides free, because he didn&#39;t want to impose on the bill I chose to pay for. I found this place, so it was my treat!

Ed was very nice about checking in on us, and seeing how we liked our food. I very much enjoyed our service, because the wait wasn&#39;t long at all, and the overall atmosphere of he place. It does have a hole-in-the-wall kind of feel, but in the best of ways, and there are loads of comments left all over these boards, that are left on the wall. 

Since it was our first time, and we were a bit stuffed to order more, Ed was nice enough to send us off with some brownies. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back, and hope by then, I won&#39;t be so indecisive about what to try; it all looks so good! Thanks again!"

This is the same concept as Pink&#39;s in Socal except no lines (thank goodness).

I got a free brownie thru Yelp check-in. It was alright.

I had the BBQ Brisket Dog. This was pretty good. Its exactly like how  you would imaging a hot dog with bbq brisket added to it. MEATTTT so good.

I think what is more unique and tasty are the sides though.
The fried pickles come as fried sticks instead of fried chips. Fried pickles are much better as sticks. This is the only place that I&#39;ve ever been to that has them as sticks. I love them.

The garlic potato nest is so good. Its like super thin potato strips that have been stir fried with garlic. Tastes super good. Definitely a must-have side.

Parking is fine. Service is good. They like to throw the water cup at you, so make sure you operate your hands in some kind of coordinated fashion!"

I ordered one of the BBW Brisket dogs - Ed suggested that I also include the &#34;Sriracha slaw&#34; to the dog. First off, the all beef dog was amazing! Top that with the brisket, slaw and other fixins and I was in hot dog heaven!

We found this place on Yelp with a perfect five star rating.  With over ninety reviews, it&#39;s statistically significant, but a validation was in order. Immediately we were greeted by the owner&#39;s daughter with a genuine smile.  She asked if it&#39;s our first visit and proceeded with a description of what the restaurant is about, including the fact that 90%+ of the menu is homemade.  The service was superb from start to finish!

The place is very cozy and comfortable with ample parking! 

I had the Windy City Dog and the BBQ Brisket Dog, both tasty in their own way.  I specifically asked for the Windy City Angus dog not to be butterflied, that&#39;s how they are cooked in Chicago.  Best Chicago style dog in a long time.  

Definitely returning for more!"

That doesn&#39;t happen very often. It&#39;s close enough to work that my husband and I were able to swing over there during lunch yesterday. 
The owner was working the register, and he is hilarious. His service and personality really pushed the ratings up. He offered suggestions to us that really hit the spot. My husband and I shared the Chili Pie Dog, Windy City Dog, and Eddie Spaghetti Dog, along with sides of tater tots and potato nest with the special house jalapeno ranch. First of all, the dog itself is the best part, in my opinion. That solid, well-made foundation really anchors the rest of the dish. I say &#34;dish&#34; here because I wouldn&#39;t think of these as simple hot dogs, either. They are more like hot dog centered creations. For example, the Eddie Spaghetti dog was Italian sausage with spaghetti, tomato sauce, and cheese on top. It tasted like a complete dish rather than just a hot dog. The Chili Pie dog was a beef dog with house chili, cheese, and fritos on top. The windy city was your classic Chicago dog. 
Now, you need to have a big mouth to eat these. Don&#39;t try to be dainty and cut it up - that&#39;s just ruination. You need to get some of everything in the bite. Don&#39;t worry, there are plenty of napkins at each table. 
I am really excited about my future of coming here at least weekly for lunch. There are so many options (did I mention you can create your own dog?), including burgers and sandwiches, the place is clean, there&#39;s rockin music going in the background, and the owner is delightful."

I ordered an Italian sausage and they suggested adding grilled onions &amp; peppers. After I sat down to wait for my order, I began wondering how my $4.45 Italian sausage wound up costing me almost $7.00. So, I grabbed a menu and found the add-on cost for the grilled onions and peppers was $2.25. To me, that&#39;s outlandish. Their &#34;Chicago&#34; dog is almost double the price of other places and they&#39;re not even real Vienna Beef franks. The folks were nice and my sandwich was good. But, I don&#39;t appreciate being overcharged. If you don&#39;t mind, give Harley&#39;s a try."

Last night the place was manned by the owners daughter. Very nice kid. Refused the tip we were about to leave her and said the best tip was for us to come back again. 

We ordered three hotdogs. I had the Polish Dog with bacon crumbles as my toppings.  Harley&#39;s dogs are 90-95% made in house. They were tasty, fresh and the buns were lightly grilled. You can request your dogs not butterflied. 

They have some unique ones with BBQ meat as its toppings. I have to venture that way some day.

My boyfriend and I are visiting Denver on our way to California from Houston, TX. Let me just say stopping here for lunch was the best decision we have made since leaving Houston. 
We were immediately greeted by the owner, Ed. He&#39;s so nice and personable, and the interaction with him alone elevated our experience ten fold. 
I chose the BBQ Brisket Dog and Matt chose the Death Vader. We also ordered the potato nest &amp; fried pickles. Being from Texas, I have pretty high standards for brisket, and BBQ in general, but this dog absolutely nailed it. Sriacha slaw was an added bonus! The Death Vader was just as delicious but more spicy. Both sides were amazing and hit the spot. 

Ed is clearly doing it right. I love supporting small businesses, especially with an owner who truly cares and genuinely interacts with every guest.

Ed was hilarious and really perked up a very sour day we were having. Husband had the BBQ beef brisket and he thought it was the best dog he had ever had! I tried the pastrami dog and really liked it. We both tried each other&#39;s and I think we both agreed that the BBQ hot dog is amazing, best slaw I&#39;ve ever had on it! 
Great place to go for a good dog and if you want a break from all the PC bs and just talk to each other like human beings."

I had the Fried Pickle Dog (deep fried pickle spears top this 100% Angus Beef Dog w/ zesty Jalapeño Ranch on a toasted everything bun) with a potato nest (thin curly potatoes fried, mmmm good) and a large drink.  Ordered as a meal it runs you about $10 (saves you about 1.25).  My buddy had the Chili Pie Dog, it looked excellent.
Just so you know, I&#39;m not one to order a hot dog anywhere but a Harley&#39;s &#34;A Hot Dog Revolution&#34; is the one place that I&#39;ll do it again, and likely again....
The only caution I have for you in eating at Harley&#39;s is you might have to be able to catch your drink cup, cause they toss it to you in a nice easy pop fly fashion (If I can catch it anyone can)."

It was a small little place but had excellent food. Today, it still holds true. The dogs, sandwiches, and fries are all delicious. The owner and staff are very friendly and made my family and I feel like we were at home. 

What could be better: the iced tea is pre-mixed. The flavor does not taste like fresh brewed iced tea and is a major disappointment. Secondly, the chili (red and green) is delicious but the green could be a little spicier. Finally, the music is a little loud making it difficult to have a conversation with the family. 

What excels: as I wrote above, the hot dogs, sandwiches, and fries are excellent. Quality resonates, which is really important. It was nice to see a 6-top table. This fits my family and I. The staff is excellent making our time at the restaurant even better. 

(Fix the iced tea and I&#39;ll bump this review to a 5!!!)"

The owner is super friendly and seems genuinely interested in getting to know his patrons, and the rest of the staff seem pretty great, too.  I really love supporting local businesses like Harley&#39;s. 

I&#39;ve tried the windy city dog and the fried pickle dog.  Both delicious and just enough to fill me up.  The $2.95 upcharge to make it a meal combo seems a little steep to me, but the sides are unique and delicious (try the Texas toothpix!)."

I was working from home that day so I couldn&#39;t stay and eat it - but the atmosphere inside and out was charming and SO happy!

Traveling the US gives me lots of experience in finding quality food, and Harley&#39;s blew me away. I ordered the New York pastrami dog, prepared to perfection with a light, crispy side of potato nest paired with a bright, just-spicy-enough-but-not-too-spicy jalapeño ranch sauce.

Aside from the amazing food - which I highly recommend - the kitschy atmosphere is casual, fun, and the service is top-notch. I asked what the two most popular items were and the friendly server happily recommended two items, what I ordered, and the brisket dog. She was later very helpful and above-average in ensuring I was completely satisfied with my meal, checking in frequently and asking how each component was. Even thanked me with a brownie for visiting from out of town!

Having spent a LOT of time in Texas and having experienced some of the world&#39;s most highly-awarded barbecue, and having never been here before, I wanted to give them a fair shot at meeting up to their Yelp reviews. My guess after eating my meal? Texas would have had been given a real run for their money. Will definitely be back next time I&#39;m in the area."

We came in on a quiet rainy night and he was so friendly and funny. He chatted and joked with us like we were long time buds. Seriously an awesome dude. Third reason you need to eat here: the patio is so cool. With stranded lights brightening up the space and a sweet John Lennon mural, we will definitely be back to eat on the patio.

I tried the brisket dog with Sriracha Cole slaw and a side of tots with jalapeño ranch dipping sauce. The brisket was perfectly tender with the spicy cold slaw completing the experience. The bun was soft and not intrusive. The tots were crunchy, soft and hot. I would have licked the dipping sauce container if I weren&#39;t in public just to not leave any behind.

First, I digress - if you haven&#39;t been to a theater production at Town Hall, you must make a point to do so. It&#39;s well-done local theater in a quaint and quirky (an old jail) and intimate venue. And, if you happen to read this while &#34;Young Frankenstein&#34; is still playing, it&#39;s an absolute must-see. 

Now back to Harley&#39;s. It&#39;s small, but a very pleasant cubbyhole in a corner of the old Woodlawn Shopping Center. It&#39;s easy to find, has good access and lots of parking. While small, it&#39;s big enough - we had 6 in our party and they have a table for 6 and several other tables for 2, 3 or 4. You order at the counter - the young lady at the counter was absolutely delightful - insisted on throwing our beverage cups one at a time to each member of our party. Besides being fun, she was very helpful - on every sandwich we ordered, she told us the recommended toppings - none of it was up-selling - they were all included in the price. They call your name and you pick up your food at the counter when it&#39;s ready.

We had a New York Pastrami Dog (pastrami, grilled onions and German mustard topping a grilled hot dog), BBQ Brisket Dog (brisket, Sriracha slaw and BBQ sauce topping a grilled hot dog), Peppy Pizza Dog (pepperoni, marinara, and melted mozzarella topping a spicy Italian sausage), Toga Dog (a sausage of lamb and beef with gyro seasoning with lettuce, onion, tomato and spicy tzatziki on top) and a Buff Daddy Dog (buffalo brat topped with melted cheddar cheese and jalapeno ranch sauce). Sandwiches are priced ala carte and range from $5.95 to $6.95. Make it a meal for another $2.95 - a soft drink and your choice of fries, homemade chips or a &#34;potato nest&#34; (grated and deep-fried potato shreds nested together). The potato nest was the one very weak link in our experience - it was greasy and substantially under-cooked. Otherwise, our experience was terrific.

I live in Golden and I&#39;ll happily drive to Littleton for Harley&#39;s. Loved the food, loved the young lady at the counter, and the value is plenty good enough. Besides, I hear the Chili Pie Dog, Windy City Dog, Holy Guacamole Dog and N&#39;Orleans Dog calling &#34;try me, try me,&#34; and who am I to ignore the siren call of talking hot dogs."

Harley&#39;s appeal is two-fold. First, the food is great, they make great dogs, from your standard Chicago-style to more adventurous offerings. I&#39;m partial to the ones with brisket on them, they&#39;re some of the best hot dogs I&#39;ve had anywhere. Also, don&#39;t sleep on the potato nest. 

Second, the staff here is great, and they make you feel like you&#39;re part of the family, to the point that I actually apologized last time I was in there because it&#39;d been a few months. For lunch, or a light dinner with family, you can&#39;t go wrong with Harley&#39;s."

They also serve fantastic side potatoes and onions. Ed the owner is very friendly, but has Fox News polluting the atmosphere in his place of work. Taking a bite into a delicious chili dog and then looking up and seeing O&#39;Reilly on the tube made me lose my appetite.

This place is nothing short of awesome. Here&#39;s why:

STAFF: seem friendly enough and helpful. I had made reservations for this past Sunday for lunch with my parents - as I know this place is still pretty popular and fills up fast. we were greeted with smiles and offered samples of their various beer on tap! our server, was young, nice and encouraged us to try a variety of offerings. He filled our waters constantly and our beers were never empty.

FOOD: ehhhhhhh. i&#39;ve had better. literally everything was average and nothing insanely special. I opted for the shrimp and grits (which was decent) hubs noshed on the burger (meh), while dad had the BLT with avocado and their soup of the day. the soup and my dish were by far the best, while everything else was just okay. Not terrible, but not amazing - I - want-to-return-for-that, either.

SPACE: so cute, cozy, and really cool. The vaulted ceilings make the place feel even bigger and the natural light makes it feel wide open. I love the mismatched chairs/large booths, community tables and roaring fire place.  I could easily see renovating a house to look just like this!! Cornhole and other games are out back, along with the tasting room across the street - which we were tempted to do, but tours fill up fast, so make a reservation!

BEER: delicious, as always :) I really like the tasting area at the front entrance, along with the cooler of 6 packs and special bombers for purchase!

I can&#39;t wait to return here again for more brews with family and friends!"

This is seriously one of the best salads in the world and yet it is so basic. By far the best thing on the menu. The buttermilk ranch is so creamy and give the veggies just the right touch. This time I tried it with some grilled chicken on top.  It was really good, but taste better without the chicken actually. The chicken is more for filler. My fiance got the peach bread pudding french toast.  If you want something super sweet and gooey, I would recommend getting that. It was covered in almonds and blackberries oozing all over the plate. Yes, dessert for brunch. 

The place gets busy, so I suggest getting reservations. And I don&#39;t think they take reservations of 7 or more, so beware. I have had nothing but great service from the bartenders and servers each time I have gone. They have been fantastic with suggestions!

When we walked in, however, there was quite a line for a Saturday night and I had a plane to catch so I was worried when they gave us a 35-40 minute wait time for two people since it was a Saturday night.

However we were able to squeeze into two seats at the bar for a beer (I had the flight with the mango, white IPA, breck IPA and the bourbon brewed 11%&#39;er!) which were really delicious, and similar but still unique. We also ordered the pretzel, which disappointly turned out to be one small stick, but at least tasted good despite the watery &#34;Cream cheese&#34; it came with. 

We were called about 25 minutes later to our table and didn&#39;t have to wait long for our server, nor did I have to ask her for a water. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries - both were VERY good. The pork had plenty of sauce on it (though my friend typically asks for extra), and the fries were light and crispy.Oh and all of the food came to us within MINUTES. Pretty sure it was a record of any place I&#39;ve ever been!

Overall turned out to be a great experience and I&#39;d love to check out the games they have outside another time when I&#39;m not a bit rushed."

We decided to go, anyway, and only had to wait a half hour! Even that went fast as we were tasting beers at the tasting bar. We&#39;re seated in the area that had clear plastic walls to open in the warm weather. This was perfect because it was quieter. The elk burger and chips were good, but the pot pie just blah.

The salmon was cooked perfectly, the pot pie was outstanding and the appetizer and dessert did not disappoint. We&#39;ve never had an issue with the service, and it was stellar as usual.

I also tried the elk chili - amazing - and the cornbread - as good as it gets.

Now to the food. We started off with the meat and cheese board.  Was good but not $15 good.  Plus only half a baguette which doesn&#39;t go far on a cheese and meat board.  For the main meal I Ordered the special which was a grilled shrimp po boy and on a rainy day sounded good.  Well it comes out and no lie 2 small shrimp on each side of the po boy.  No flavor.  Then the waitress asked if they could add bacon to it to make up for lack of shrimp.  More shrimp would have made up lack of shrimp.  Manager finally took it off the ticket.

We took him up on the offer and when we saw how incredibly busy the restaurant was (on a Tuesday night, no less!), I must say I was a little shocked that he would bother to offer us a comped meal, especially when the initial review wasn&#39;t that bad.  

This time around we were seating by the fireplace and that was nice touch - I got to sit in a cozy armchair next the the fireplace and enjoy the view of the open kitchen and bar.  We both agreed that our server was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.  She was working the patio as well as several tables inside, and even though she was constantly running around on that busy evening, our orders came out quickly and correctly, our drinks were always topped off, and she was constantly watching out for our table without intruding.  This was all the more impressive when we found out that she wasn&#39;t aware we were there for special customer service visit - she was just treating us the way she treated all of her customers.  The food was also a more positive experience this time around, for the most part.  While my partner wasn&#39;t overly enthused by his pulled pork sandwich, I stole about half the beer battered fries off his plate.  I&#39;m a bit of a french fry aficionado and I&#39;d put these fries in my top 10 list.  So good.  I wasn&#39;t terribly hungry (and was saving room for dessert), so I ordered the meatball and green chile grits appetizer as my entree.  The meatballs were surprising spicy (a plus in my book) and the grits were quite good. Dessert, unfortunately, was a little bit of a disappointment.  I ordered the strawberry rhubarb mason jar thingy (can&#39;t remember the name).  It was served it a very slender jar that made it difficult to eat without making a giant mess and also made it difficult to get a bite of all the different layers at once.  It was too sweet for me and I only ate half.  The Boy, meanwhile, ordered a bacon beer ice cream that he didn&#39;t care for either (not sweet enough, apparently... perhaps we should have traded dishes!), though he did really love the beer-based caramel sauce he ordered to go with it.

Bottom line:  Farmhouse is very popular, and with the service we&#39;ve experienced there, I can definitely see why.  While the food isn&#39;t consistently to our liking, our experience was overall positive and we both agreed it&#39;s worth visiting again if we&#39;re in the area."

Now I will admit that I am using Olympic Gymnastics grading here, start with a perfect score and deduct for errors.  

The only objections that I had were due to the layout of the restaurant as we were on the porch area and when everything is opened up the traffic flow is less then ideal.  A bit of squeezing past people, which is never pleasant for anyone.

The beer was delicious and the beers that are on tap are wonderfully eclectic and very enjoyable.  The appetizers were solidly ok.  Not bad, not great, ok.  We had the pretzel bread and again, not bad, but not amazing, and not really something I would order again.  My wife had the elk burger and I am very happy to say, she ordered it Medium-Rare, and it came out Medium-Rare.  Doesn&#39;t sound like much, you know, serving a burger how it is ordered, but it is something that would have significantly dropped their scoring should they have not done so.

I had the fish and chips and was very pleased with the meal, very delicious.  Finish off with a dessert who&#39;s name escapes me, but it is served with a beer wort ice cream that was very well balanced and delicious!  

I&#39;ll be back if just for the beer."

It&#39;s a little deep in Littleton so this is our first time making it out, and I must say I cannot wait to come back! The tasting room was closed for private tours so we only went to the farm house but the space was amazing! Very rustic and well done! A huge space with many tables, but I just can&#39;t get over how great it was decorated! 

We sat at the bar, naturally, and it was a large wrap around bar like it should be! I wanna say they had something like 20 taps and all of their beers were wonderful. Lucky u IPA on Nitro was dreamy, and the Berliner Weisse with blood orange was so light and refreshing. We ended up getting 6 tasters and a pint and really there wasn&#39;t a beer we tried that we wouldn&#39;t order! 

Now about their food...we spilt an order of fish and chips...omg biggest pieces of fish I had ever seen...they almost looked obscene If you know what I mean! They were wonderful big succulent piece of cod, beer battered and served with malt vinegar. There was also a kale and Brussel slaw on the side that was a nice addition. Better than your average boring slaw! I&#39;m not sure how one person could eat this all on their own! We also saw some pretty delicious meals being ordered around us. They must have a breakfast menu because I swear I saw a Benny but our menus were lunch and dinner only...and the wedge salad...I saw a lot of those and they looked bomb! I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more delicious beers and tasty eats.

So I have to mention this...I kind of feel like George Costanza but...THE BATHROOMS....thank god I had to pee when I got here. I think these are my favorite bathrooms that I&#39;ve ever been in. I wish I could decorate my house like these bathrooms. Even if you don&#39;t have to use them I would just walk in there just to check them out!"

Also, this place is dog friendly, which I think is awesome!

I came here with some a group a friends on Saturday afternoon, and the group included a set of 5 year old twins. This is one of the few places around where the adults can enjoy themselves, and the kiddos can wear themselves out too, and everyone can go home happy. We chose to sit outside in the beer garden where they have picnic tables close to the area where there are the outdoor games that are good for kid (and adults too!). The kiddos had a great time playing Cornhole and running around all the open space. The downside to this was that we had to go inside to order beer from the bar if we wanted something other than the 4-5 varieties that were available from the tent outside, and we were limited to the food offerings from the food truck outside. The other downside? Sunburns. Ouch!! There are about 10 umbrellas out there, to cover a ton of tables and a 1/2 acre of open space. Management: buy more umbrellas!

I&#39;ll certainly be back, but more for the fun times, and less for the food. My cheeseburger was a run-of-the-mill burger, and the fries were so salty that they were inedible. Also, for those who aren&#39;t beer drinkers at all, just be aware that they serve no other alcoholic beverages here other than beer (but with all the microbrews that Breckenridge Brewery makes, even this wine-loving gal found some yummy brews)."

Service is great. The managers always table touch. The beer is great. Parking is free and ample. I like the veggie pasta with chicken. The mac n cheese is great. The Elk burger is divine and juicy.

Overall, I recommend it. Can&#39;t think of anything bad to say!"

What a great and professional experience. I recently hosted a corporate event at the Farm House for a group of 30. As I arrived, I was greeted by the manager, the event coordinator and all wait staff. They accommodated us with a privatized portion of the back patio. Knowing afternoons in Colorado, the weather was being unpredictable. While worried at first, I was quickly comforted by the fact that they had awnings and patio heaters available in the case the weather turned. It. Was. PERFECT!

Not a single person had a complaint about the venue, the food or the flowing drinks that came to us. The wait staff we waited on us hand and foot! The food came out quick and our cups were never empty. The food portions were generous and affordable.

One thing I wish we could have experienced was a brewery tour. Of which was completely my decision not to do. Normally the brewery portion is not open during the weekdays. But they were absolutely open to hosting a private brewery tour to accommodate our Tuesday night event. 

Hands down recommend this venue for any corporate event.

Thanks Farmhouse for the AMAZING experience."

The service was friendly and our food arrived quickly. Our beverage glasses were always filled, and many employees stopped by to see if everything was alright. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper and Portobello Mushroom sandwich, and I was easily able to substitute the fries or potatoes with the Carrot soup. The soup was flavorful and not overly sweet, which I always worry about when ordering a carrot or butternut squash soup. The sandwich was also flavorful, but I am thinking that an aioli, perhaps a garlic aioli, would have gave the sandwich a &#34;wow&#34; factor. Overall, we had a good experience, and I was very impressed with their selection of beers."

There were several of us and we were seated in the dining room area. There is also a bar and an outdoor section designed for lounging around and relaxing.

We were all pretty hungry and most of us ordered the buttermilk fried chicken. Mine was just okay. I have had really good versions of this in Atlanta, and this didn&#39;t measure up. It came with collards and mashed potatoes. Everything seemed dry. Quite possibly an off day. There wasn&#39;t much to choose from on the menu. 

The place is really beautiful. It was clean, big, and relaxing. I will return for the beer. I&#39;m a big fan of the many beers it has on tap."

Just opened in 2015, the big Red Barn restaurant is the new hot place in Littleton, often commanding 2 hour waits to get into the great room for dining, or on the beautiful patio littered with picnic tables.

The brewing facility and tasting room is just next door, and the restaurant is down closer to the river.  It is big and spacious and well designed, almost big chain-like....This and several other factors hint that maybe Breckenridge Brewery is trying a little too hard to become big and great???

Our group sat in the sofa section, and had beers and draft cider.  The nitrogen stouts were a hit for most members of the group, citing a velvety texture beyond compare.  

Some of us dined!  The hits were the 8 inch tall deviled eggs, an inspired creation of piping and blending- YUM!  I could have stopped there.  But no, I also tried the smoked chicken and polenta.  This was a dish that at my house, would have been marched out and deposited in the COMPOST bin.  Truly awful, someone please get a recipe for how to cook polenta to these people.  Similarly, the British Boyfriend&#39;s fish and chips were made with some thick dough like a cake doughnut and were truly terrible.  That being said, the fries were great, as was the hand-cranked sausage appetizer.

So the kitchen has some kinks to work out for sure, and the waitstaff was severely understaffed causing us to get up at least three times to &#34;go find our server&#34;.  So there are some issues:  Come expecting to be disappointed by something, but probably quite happy with the beer and venue and you will enjoy the Farm House!"

I had a steak that was cooked perfectly and of course I enjoyed a whole collection of tastings of different beers. What I found nice about the place this time is that we were able to enjoy ourselves without it being either overcrowded or empty. Great crowd without being shoulder to shoulder and my wife myself and my children all enjoyed. Staff is very friendly, if a little overworked.

Elk burger was average tasting - grossly overcooked with unsalted fried onions.  Burnt homemade potato chips with it. Kids spaghetti tasted like mold. Not sure if they added thyme (most likely), rosemary, or a combination of thyme and marjoram, but it didn&#39;t taste good. Why not stick to basil and oregano, especially on a kids menu item?  Free beer samples while we waited were the first only reason we didn&#39;t walk out.  Damn you free beer.
And is the King&#39;s Dish a Burton Style Ale (as the packaging says) or an ESB (as the server and bill said)?  Last I heard, a Burton Style Ale is more of an IPA than an ESB."

Let&#39;s start with the positives: This place is huge and the decor is amazing.
The place is really well built and fun to be in, lots of exposed beams and hanging pendant lights, gives it a really nice farmhouse feel. The wrap-around bar offers plenty of seating. And the french fries are the boss!

However, the wait staff and the chicken fried chicken entree really leave a lot to be desired.
We had a beer while we were waiting for our table and when we were seated we were still working on our first round. Shortly after introducing himself, I finished my first beer; and then was never, ever, asked if I wanted another round until (get this) after our meal was finished! It&#39;s the little things that count man... like asking if we want another beer, after we finish it.

I ordered the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens, and the entire meal was just... blah. I&#39;ve had better chicken fried chicken at Denny&#39;s. First off, it was more chicken fried tenders rather than a chicken fried chicken. I guess in my head I was expecting a slab of chicken, like a full breast, smothered in gravy, like the good Lord intended it to be. But no, there was a tiny dollop of gravy that they dropped into the potatoes, barely enough to cover up the extra dry flavor of them, and definitely not enough to share between the chicken and the potatoes. The buttermilk batter had no flavor what-so-ever, just bland breading. The gravy was way too sweet for gravy.
The collard greens was nothing but an undercooked greasy mess slapped onto the plate.

I was told that my wife&#39;s elk burger was amazing, even though it was undercooked. But after the disappointment of my meal and the general inattentiveness of our waiter; I can&#39;t say I&#39;m looking forward to coming back here for food any time in the near future."

The outside area is huge and so fun especially if you have kids with you.  Tons of room for them to run and play.  The patio does get really hot though and there is virtually no shade anywhere, even with the patio umbrellas.

I&#39;m giving this place 3 stars only because of our last experience.  We had a group of 9 and were planning on sitting outside but there were some ominous looking clouds coming our way so I decided to head in and see if I could make a reservation for 30 mins from then when the storm may hit.  I overheard the hostess telling the people in front of me they could take a certain table but would need to be done by 7 as it had a reservation on it.  So I was quite shocked when I went to the hostess and asked to make a reservation and she said &#34;we don&#39;t take reservations.&#34;  Wait what?  Didn&#39;t I just hear you say... Then she told me they take reservations but not same-day reservations.  Huh?  What&#39;s the difference between the two????  

Anyways, after this I decided to go ahead and get a table for our party.  To which she replied &#34;that&#39;s fine, we just can&#39;t push the tables together so you&#39;ll have to sit next to each other.&#34;   What?????  How do you plan on accommodating large groups and actually, last weekend when I was here I saw the exact same tables pushed together.  I understand that some places have crazy rules but even so, the delivery from the hostess was way off.  She had a nasty attitude and was not helpful I suggesting how to accommodate us.  We were a group of 9, not 50, it shouldn&#39;t have been that challenging.  Long story short, the supervisor came to our section and happy pushed our tables together and was extremely nice and helpful. 

I have to say, I enjoy this place and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back but I would recommend working on having a hostess with a little less attitude.  Not the best way to start your experience."

It&#39;s a brewery so the beer is good. The food can be hit-or-miss, but the hits are HITS. I personally love the skillet bread and the buffalo burger. The fried chicken is good too. We&#39;ve tried several desserts but none were as good as the skillet bread (it&#39;s listed as an app on the menu)."

I highly recommend weekend brunch. The brunch menu items are great, but if you go for the buffet you will get to experience soooo much more tasty goodness. The only thing Breck lacks is that I can&#39;t hang out with my dog while I play cornhole or giant jenga outside while I sip a tasty brew (a mango mosaic pale ale perhaps). It still gets 5 stars. Growler fills are also reasonably priced so you can take something tasty home you might not be able to find bottled. Hands down my favorite place in Littleton."

I made the reservation via Yelp and requested a table outside in the shade, and that&#39;s exactly where we were seated - a four-top on the porch.  I was very glad to be outside because we were gathering for catch-up conversation, and the noise level inside would have made that difficult.  

Our server, Jason, was very friendly, funny &amp; prompt.  The beer list is of course incredible, and they have a couple of draughts on nitro - including one of the IPAs which was a treat being different from the usual porter/stout on nitro.  Beers are very reasonably priced - most $5/pint, a few $6. We all especially enjoyed the Mango Mosaic. Samplers also available.

Food was delicious as well.  I had the Elk burger because I can&#39;t resist a rare item on a menu - and it was great!  Others in the party had the chuck wagon burger, the low &amp; slow pulled pork and the Infinite Harvest kale salad.  No complaints, everyone enjoyed.

There were lots of folks on bicycles and Jason informed us that there had recently been a stop added to the nearby bike trail adjacent to the property (I believe it&#39;s the &#34;Mary Carter Greenway Trail&#34; that follows the South Platte River).

We will be back!"

My second visit here was for a business dinner tonight. We had excellent service and delicious food. I had beer chicken, would have been great if there were no bones. Everyone else got the meatloaf, it looked amazing and everyone said it was great. It&#39;s on my list for next time!! 

The discovery I made when booking the table, it that even Wednesday nights can be busy. Open table will allow you to book for a table of 6 but not 7+, excellent because I wanted a table for 7. 
When I called, there were no larger dining tables left but were told we could have a high table for 6 and they could put an extra seat on the end. Funnily enough, one person decided they couldn&#39;t come at the last minute but it still would have been comfy with 7 although 8 people at that table would have been squishy. 

Original review: 
We came here in early December on a Friday night with a big group of gym buddies. We didn&#39;t book but they had managed to get the lounge area at the front, it was a busy night so it was a little squishy right there but it wasn&#39;t too bad. 

Our waitress was pretty good, remembered what I was drinking and everyone else in our group. We ordered the broccoli app, it was nice. A few other people had ordered apps prior to is getting there and the table didn&#39;t get cleared for hours. Our app came out while there were still dirty plates on the table &amp; we were slowly picking on it. I guess we were too slow because before we&#39;d finished eating it the waitress decided to clear the table, including our food, scraping crumbs off the table top into our plate before we got a chance to tell her we were still eating it! 
We told her, she was very apologetic and offered to bring us another one. We were just about to leave so we declined, but she didn&#39;t offer to remove it from the bill or anything. We just paid the cheque and left a very minimal tip."

Made a reservation because I heard it can be hard to get in without one (definitely recommend doing this!), once we arrived we were seated right away. Our waitress greeted us and happily helped me find a beer I would like. 

They don&#39;t have daily specials, but I think they have &#39;the soup of the day&#39;. We had the cast iron bread as an appetizer and it was delicious (but a little salty for my taste). The preserves were fresh and tasty. 

We had the ribeye and salmon. Beautiful presentation and cooked to perfection. The ribeye even came with béarnaise and our waitress offered A1 sauce too. We didn&#39;t have dessert because we were too full!  Perfect sized portions - not a plate piled high with food like a lot of places these days. 

Atmosphere was great. Not too loud, but even with an open concept it still felt cozy. Giant fireplace inside, with fire pits and picnic tables outside for families to let their kids run free and play lawn games. 

Definitely a great place to take &#39;out-of-towners&#39; to give them a taste of the Colorado vibe!"

Its not really my style of place, but my wife wanted to go there and we had a free night that has become rare for us, so I gave in and we went to check it out.  The place is alot bigger than I thought.  We were seated immediately on the patio, which was pretty nice.  It was a beautiful day.  I was impressed with the patio and all the outdoor space and games.  So far, I actually liked what I was seeing.

Now I am not a craft beer guy.... I like budweiser.  I ordered their Lager and was actually happy with my choice.  It had good flavor and was one of the better crafts I have had.  Now they have two plusses on my board and Im beginning to think that I may have misjudged the book by the cover.  I will say however it did take 13 minutes from the time we ordered our beers to the time we received them which is pretty slow for any establishment.

Perusing through the menu, I noticed they had fried chicken, which I love, and though, man this place is going to win me over.  I ordered the fried chicken, with whipped potatoes and chips, asking for the gravy to be left on the side so that I can add myself.  My wife ordered the BLAT.  I wish I could say BB kept impressing from here, but that was the end of the good fortune for me.  The first time our food arrived, my plate had gravy all over it, not on the side as I had asked.  No big deal, except that fried chicken doesnt cook quickly and my wife would soon be done eating and I wouldnt have a plate yet.

The second time my plate arrived it was correct.  HOWEVER and this to me is a big however, their fried chicken is not really what its cracked up to be.  Its BONELESS, its SKINLESS, and its fried.  Not at all what I thought I would be getting from the description in the menu.  May as well have been chicken tenders at that point.  It was two breast peices and a thigh.   THe thigh was still raw.  (of course it was, I prefer the dark meat)  The breasts were overcooked and dry.  The chips were cold, like felt like they came out of a refrigerator cold.  Not sure how that happened and the whipped potatoes were just meh...

Anyways, I really really really think if your going to have fried chicken on your menu and its not traditional, then you should explain that to your guests on the menu.\

All said and done, the manager comped my meal, which was courteous, but expected.  Now normally a restaurant with slower than average service and poor food in my opinion wouldnt get three stars from me, but the ambience, beer, patio and games all pushed them up a little bit.  I would go back for drinks and play time, but probably wont have dinner here again."

We went a couple weeks after opening and it was great! Came back and our server, &#34;Garth&#34; came for drink order and we added an app but never got the app. Our regular food came out and we had to ensure we weren&#39;t charged for that. He acknowledged that he forgot to input it into the compurer but didnt offer any redemption in the error. He never came back for us to order another drink until we were done with our food and I was getting up to go to the bar with my flight tray. He tried to clear out our food while still eating. Felt like they were trying to clear us out when we were there to enjoy lunch and a few drinks on a Sunday afternoon. The supervisors in the vicinity clearing tables avoided eye contact with us as well while we just were looking for a drink from our flight to enjoy. 

We tried to sign up for a brewery tour but the Web navigation either went to nothing or went to the open table site where it said the restaurant wasn&#39;t on the site. I went to the hostess station for assistance with booking a tour and she told me to go online on my phone, I was explaining to her that it wasn&#39;t coming up and she tried to get me to go on my phone again until I finally asked if she could just help me with it. She finally did to say it was booked, which is fine, it was a busy Sunday but just frustrated with the level of hospitality at this location.  Hopefully the next time we come back the service will have improved on all fronts."

Tons of beer on tap and rotating handles from Wynkoop. I tried a Ginger Cider from C Squared and it was delicious! We had the Kale Salad and the wings. Both were good- but not great. The Kale Salad came drenched in dressing and covered with cheese which I was not expecting. A light dusting would have been sufficient. It was missing the sunflower seeds (I had to dig though to make sure they weren&#39;t buried underneath all of that dressing and cheese) but they brought some out of me after I asked. It was a good salad but could have been so much better if put together properly.
The wings had a great flavor but some on the bottom did not get covered in wing sauce and the chicken itself was a bit dry. 
They do have a happy hour- it runs M-F from 2-6 (I think) and is just $1 off beers. Nothing too exciting. It&#39;s great for groups and is certainly very busy so I think they&#39;ll survive if Hubs and I don&#39;t return for a while..."

The value for the food is sub-par to what they charge. Want a substitute for fries? That&#39;s extra! A warning about extra ticket items would be nice, as the up selling is a bit extreme here, and it would be nice to know about before receiving the check.

The service is always great and there&#39;s plenty of parking and seating.  First lunch was with a big party.  Free tasty pork rinds for the table was a nice touch.  I had an Elk Burger, perfectly cooked and great flavors.  The second lunch was just a few people.  No pork rinds this time.  I tried the Fish and Chips, which wasn&#39;t very good.  Way too much batter and none of it stuck to the actual fish.  The batter itself was also over-fried and had an undesirable aftertaste.  Based on the inconsistency of quality of the food and the high prices, I&#39;d say the place is just OK...

Several items are a repeat performance. I call them the Staples of the Brewery. The cast iron bread with the homemade seasonal preserves is yummy. Three of the group got the Fish and Chips and other person go homemade chicken soup and salad. There were several desserts that were fresh to choose from.

The Place: Great versatile atmosphere! Breck&#39;s newest digs is located on a beautiful sprawling plot of land. It&#39;s large modern farm house style buildings make you feel like you feel that you are no longer in the suburbs of Denver but somehow magically transported to the setting of the next whimsical lifetime movie set. Large screened in patio, sturdy farmhouse tables, a majestic fireplace, bonfire pits outside, impressive beautiful bar, and plenty of picnic tables and open seating while you wait. This place is great to enjoy some hearty food and drinks during all seasons.

My favorite dish is the fried chicken dinner. Juicy chicken snuggled inside the perfect breading with a hint of sweetness. This pair wonderfully with their farmhouse or saison. I have had a hard time getting both of these beers recently, they seem to be out of it and keep saying they are brewing more. Either way, they are definitely worth the wait.  The fish and chips are pretty yummy too. Warning: there is a TON of breading on the fish and chips, I personally enjoy it that way but I have had others in our party not so fond of it. Their cheeseburger soup is more like a thick sauce. I do not recommend it as soup but as an awesome side to dip fries in!

If possible, save room for dessert! Their mini cast iron apple pie with vanilla ice cream is the perfect touch to send you careening over the edge into a food coma. Their lemon pudding was probably my least favorite dessert simply because it was very sweet.

I absolutely love coming here with a big group of friends and/or family. It&#39;s a great spot to relax, catch up, enjoy dinner and some drinks together.

Some tips: This is not an in and out experience. Allow a couple hours to enjoy dinner and drinks. I also highly recommend making a reservation a few days before - otherwise there can be a long wait around dinner time- however hanging out with some beers and enjoying the sights is a-okay too!"

Later, we had lunch during peak hours on Saturday brunch, and I felt the staff did a great job to accommodate all the needs of our team, even mine.

It definitely has an authentic farm house feel and on beautiful summer days, I can&#39;t imagine a better place to grab a beer. 

I&#39;ve only been twice, but both times my meals were off the charts and packed with flavor. This most recent visit, I had the steak salad. When it came out, I thought the serving size seemed a tad small... however, I was completely satisfied by the time I was done eating. I think it&#39;s one of those things where we, as Americans, are so used to ridiculously large portions that when something comes out the size it SHOULD be, we are shocked. Regardless, it was a filling lunch for me and I enjoyed every bite. 

The service was friendly and we got everything SUPER quickly. That was a nice surprise considering we were there on a busy and beautiful Saturday afternoon.

The service really needs some work. Our server was not overly friendly or engaged at all. Burgers were seasoned with salt and pepper and ok. Kids spaghetti with butter came out with marinara on it. Had to send it back. Chicken Caesar salad was fine. Don&#39;t put tomatoes on a chicken Caesar. Our server never took the appetizer plates off the table. 2 dished of ice cream took a long time to reach the table. When they did each kid had a small scoop of half melted ice cream.

My husband had the mango beer with the salmon and apple risotto which was amazing! That is what I am getting next time for sure! It was spicy but sweet and went really well with both beers. For dessert we had the apple galette and the vanilla porter ice cream that was served with it. The ice cream was phenomenal but the apple galette was just alright.

With incredible Breckenridge beer and so many tasty things to nibble on, I&#39;ve been here nearly half a dozen times since it opened a few months ago. This new restaurant from the Breckenridge Brewery folks is huge, comfortable, beautifully designed, with a very homey atmostphere. Yes, it&#39;s often busy, but in our experience the wait has never been as long as they think it will be, and often you can find a seat at the bar while you wait for a table. 

As for food, this place is fantastic. Their meat and cheese board is worth the visit, with a spread made for two complete with local Cheeses, meats, preserves, bread and other delicacies. The Farmers Cheese dip is divine. During our last visit we ate all the chips and veggies that accompanied the dip so my hubby finished it off with a spoon. Yep, it&#39;s that good. 

As for main dishes, my favorite is Fry Pan Striped Bass or the Ranch Grilled Chicken sandwiches. You can&#39;t go wrong with either of those, so I haven&#39;t tried much else. However from experience and based on what I&#39;ve seen, everything looks good. 

No matter what you get, you absolutely MUST get the cast iron bread. It&#39;s a small serving of delicious fresh made bread, sort of like biscuits, served with smoky creamery butter and house-made seasonal preserves. It&#39;s incredible. 

The dessert offerings at the Farm House also look great, but we&#39;ve always been far too stuffed to try any of them. Someday... 

If the weather is nice, after dinner go spend some time in the yard just past the beer garden. There are games, lots of room to spread out, and it&#39;s just a wonderful place to hang out while you enjoy another beer."

My mom makes plans to meet up with some family she hasn&#39;t seen in 20 years. She dressed up for the occasion, and I elected to look like a homeless mutant as usual. We get to this place, and order a round a beers like people normally do at breweries. The waiter gets to our table, and apparently thinks my mom signed up for a wet t-shirt contest because he dropped an ENTIRE TRAY full of like 6 beers right on top of her head. Now was this objectively kind of funny? Sure. In a twisted way, yeah, but we had just got there like 5 mins before this happened. My mom was a great sport about it and let him off the hook. 
The waiter and manager came over and offered to comp us two free appetizers. If two appetizers are worth getting an entire tray of beers spilled on your head, honestly I would probably take that deal about 50% of the time, but that&#39;s only because I think very little of myself. That&#39;s like what $25? That doesn&#39;t even cover half the cost of my moms shirt that was just ruined. What they should have done is buy the round of beers they tried to remake Flash Dance with, and given my mom a free t-shirt so she didn&#39;t have to wear one soaked in beer. Hell, thats free advertisement. 

As if that weren&#39;t enough the food is honestly pretty mediocre. The beer is decent, but I tend to judge my breweries based on the quality of the beer they put on the table and not the ones dumped over my head."

I&#39;ve only been there twice, but it is an excellent place for food and brews. I would not, however, get the pulled pork sandwich. I am not one for gluttonous portions, but this sandwich was pretty small, and there was not much meat on it. In addition, it was very bland in flavor. I&#39;ve had the elk burger in the past which was AMAZING! And I really am looking forward to trying out the fish &amp; chips and the buttermilk fried chicken--both of which I&#39;ve seen in person while at the restaurant. And the beer is outstanding. I really enjoyed the tequila-barrel-aged beer (can&#39;t remember the exact name). So, aside from the pulled pork sandwich, I love the Farmhouse!!"

Breckinridge Brew is usually just ok in my opinion, but they have guest taps as well as some beers they don&#39;t distribute like their barrel aged and farmhouse ales.   The vibe is really chill, and the design is super cool.  The four sided bar had tvs and didn&#39;t interfere with the ambience on the dining side.   

We started with the cheese &amp; meat plate which had some great cheeses and some condiments like pickled garlic and marmalades.  We ordered the fried chicken and split it, nice sized portions for us and the children.  We will be back!"

Great place to finish off a 23 mile bike ride along the Highline and Lee Gulch trails.  There are, awesomely, bike racks there to lock up your ride while you enjoy some frosty brews or post-ride snacks or meals to recharge.  On a sunny day, that patio is bliss.  It was a bit of a challenge to find a seat -- because everyone else there was enjoying the sun and warmth the same way my brother and I were.  Having the serving tents set up outside is a bit of brilliance as well, even if it did result in lines of people.  There are tables, benches and big big boulders to sit on.

My brother did not get carded - and on a busy weekend as well.  Fair note to those who leave their IDs at home and are middle-aged or those who don&#39;t look 16: you may be able to drink here without your IDs with you.  Good times, can&#39;t wait to come back after another ride."

I was a little lost when I first got here because Breckenridge created something huge! I located the farmhouse and managed to find my friends. The interior is so cute, whoever was in charge of interior design, kudos! It looks like something out of a Pinterest wedding with it&#39;s cute rustic yet modern charm. Our server was clearly very busy, and did his best to take care of us.

Instead, we were directed to sample beers at the farmhouse before our meal. However, Carole, the beer server, seemed to want nothing to do with us. It was so uncomfortable trying to sample A beer, that I wanted to leave. She was very preoccupied in anything else but us, the only people there. We stayed for lunch and our waitress did her best to remedy the situation. Food was great, atmosphere nice. I&#39;m a fan of rare and unique beer tastes and we loved the pumpkin spice latte.

Well, where to start. 3 1/2 star rating sounds right. So disappointed! Especially since this is right off the bike path . And literally down the road from Hudson gardens. For a not so conveniently located location, this seemed to be ideal for this type of brewery. Plenty of available land. Which equates to plenty of space. But, therein lies the problem: maybe too many tables for the waitstaff to handle. 

I met a friend here. She arrived early and sat in the beer garden. Plenty of space, full picnic tables for large parties. From her time, it was a full 30 min before I FORCED someone to pay attention to us. Thankfully he took our order even though we were not in his section. Saying something like our server was trying to &#39;fix the computer&#39; and thats why it took him so long. Ridiculous ... Who has waitstaff who are also your primary IT guys??? Regardless, it did not sit well. 

Again, the wait was obnoxious. 30 min from time order was placed to food on table. I also caution you that their posted menu is only &#39;kinda&#39; available outside ... Meaning they have a limited menu for those they have to walk an additional 100 feet for. Why? No clue. I&#39;ve been waitstaff in the past, this does not seem to be an Olympic caliber feat. 

Overall, reasonably priced ... For three of us with full lunches and two beers apiece it was $55 before tip. I am not typically a huge Breck Brew fan but their autumn seasonal was fantastic: a nut brown with plenty of character and balanced flavors. 

I am also pleased their beer garden, or patio area, allows &#39;well behaved&#39; dogs, going so far as to someone bringing my dog a bowl of water ... This was not a request, and this was someone who more or less had nothing to do with us. Impresssive! Just just too bad my dog&#39;s service was better than mine ..."

We got there about 5:30 on a Friday night, I did call ahead of time and was told it was a 30 minute wait and I could not get on the list via phone.  In the 15 minutes it took to get there the wait grew to 1 hour.  An hour and 20 minutes later we were paged for our table.

Two of us had burgers, one the fired chicken, and I had the fish and chips.  All of it was ok, however, none of it was worth the wait or the price IMO.  I have better fish at Gunther Toody&#39;s, the burgers are as good at Red Robin, and the chicken didn&#39;t come close to White Fence Farm.

I had signed up for their Vibe Club.  I received an e-mail coupon for a free birthday sandwich good for 2 weeks and a free sandwich with purchase of chips and a drink good for 3 weeks.

I used the coupon for a free regular sandwich for my birthday.  I filled out my bag and handed it to the cashier.  I ordered a Classic French Dip.

They called my name and I picked up my sandwich at the Pick Up counter about 5 minutes later.  The restaurant was quite crowded.  They had high and low tables.

The sandwich was wrapped in paper and cut in half and around that, wrapped in foil and placed in a bag.  The 4 ounce side of au jus was very generous.  The sandwich was exactly the way I ordered it.

I will probably be back."

I would highly recommend getting the buffalo chicken sandwich (but go easy on the buffalo sauce) and pairing it with some avocado, pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing, spinach, and tomatoes - and you got yourself a mighty fine sandwich. Their milk shakes are also fantastic, especially the Oreo milkshake. Wait times can vary depending on the business so go early to avoid the lunch rush.

I called to let them know whoever made it didn&#39;t do a good job so others didn&#39;t have the same problem and actually spoke to the guy who made it. He insisted he did it the way it is supposed to be made. I explained that we have had them many times and there is no way these were made the same. I said either you guys have gone cheap with your flavor or you just made it wrong. He said just asked for more pumps and taste before I take it the next time.

I went back and forth on what *star* rating I should give this place. I&#39;ve been into this shop twice. Once it was busy and the other time we were practically the only people in the shop. The employees are so incredibly unfriendly here ! I was willing to overlook the 1st time but when I went back a second and there was an entirely new staff and they were the same way I was very surprised. No smiling, no greeting, no Thank You - NOTHING ! Even when they come out to wipe tables they look at the floor ! 

Does Which Wich hire ZOMBIES ? After enduring 2 visits with blank stares, half frowns, and no eye contact on either visit; I&#39;m starting to wonder !!  

Ultimately I decided on 4 stars since I loved the concept and since it&#39;s fast food really didn&#39;t need to have much interaction with the staff. 

The concept of choosing your own bag and marking what you want on your sandwich is fun and something different from your ordinary sub shops ! There are so many different types I believe I may have stood there for 5 minutes just looking at the menu ! My concoction was wonderful ! They toast the subs and it was done just right.

If you haven&#39;t gone to WW here is the concept.  WW is a place that just gets it right.  They do the obvious - let you 100% customize YOUR sandwich.  As you walk into the place you are greeted with a station filled with paper bags.  The idea is you fill out the bag to customize the sandwich you want. 

Today I strayed from the basic Turkey and got a Cuban (Ham, Pork, Pickles, Lettuce &amp; Dijon on wheat - heated).  It was so yummy.  

This WW has a lot more parking that the Lone Tree one, which is extremely nice if you want to run in quickly and pick something up (without hiking in to get to the shop or fighting for a spot).

You go in and pick the bag with the kind of meat you want, make selections of the various toppings and condiments. There&#39;s lots of options and the end result is great. I wish they offered a larger size! Mmm... Too much of a great thing! Completely customizable! They have some original ideas and offer milk shakes as well to quench that sweet tooth. For all those outdoor enthusiasts out there: take a Which Wich bag next time you climb a 14ner in Colorado, take a picture with it at the sumit, and you&#39;ll get a free which!!

They only had one size sandwich, they didn&#39;t toast them and the coleslaw was more like sauerkraut (the word alone makes me want to puke). That being said we didn&#39;t come back again. Not too long ago my cousin mentioned that they now have bigger sandwiches and that was enough to get us in the door. 

I have been on this quest to find a somewhat specific salad. I get it at a sandwich shop in Michigan and they use the shredded lettuce from the sandwiches...well the point is I really like it. So when I saw the &#34;bowl&#34; option my heart started to beat faster. The bowl is pretty much just a salad that you can put any sandwich fixings on. While it isn&#39;t exactly the same it was damn close and that is awesome!

My boyfriend got a huge sandwich with turkey and a bunch of cheese and other goodies all toasted. He was in love. I tried a bite and I was instantly in lust. The beauty of Wich Wich is that you get to build your sandwich. It is like subway where they have a bunch of items you can add to a basic sandwich but there are way better items you can add and instead of having to scoot down the line with your sandwich you just write it on the bag that they end up shoving your sandwich in. It is also fun and different and that is exciting! 

We will definitely be back more often now. The one thing I will say is that the kid working the counter had a serious lack of customer service skills. He barely even said our names when our sandwiches were ready let alone a &#34;enjoy!&#34; or even a &#34;you are welcome&#34; when I said thanks."

I was Einstein hair ecstatic when I heard a new location was going in at the corner of Arapahoe Road and Parker Road in the new Cornerstar development. 

This new location is just like the others with red sharpies and brown bags to make your selections. Choose your meat, your cheese, additional toppings and your set or you can pick from their classic selections including a Monte Cristo and BLT that simply ROCK! Kid friendly place shown by their &#34;Kid Wich&#34; selections. 

Breakfast too??? You got it.  Your choices include bacon, steak, ham, veggie and sausage. 

Catering???  Oh yeah.  Stop in or give them a call for more info. 

A recommendation is to give the shakes a try. A cup of frozen goodness that will keep you coming back for more. And the fresh baked cookies are something you just can&#39;t miss. 

A definite plus is the loyalty program. Scarf down 9 of their &#34;wiches&#34; and the 10th is free! Top notch deal that more places should get in the habit of. And the good thing is the card is simply transferable. Eat at any Which Wich and get your 10th free at any location! 

While dining in besure to draw on your bag and hang it on their &#34;community wall&#34;.  Let me tell ya that there are some pretty talented people out there who can pimp a brown bag and a sharpie.

Get up, get out and get your groove on down to Which Wich.  I guarantee your mouth will thank you."

A bit daunting at first, what with the menu on the wall and the bags to write your order on. I picked it up quickly enough though, but I will admit that I was nervous my order was going to be messed up.

A very short time later - and I point this out because they did seem busy - my wich was ready and damn.....was it tasty! I went with the buffalo chicken, which was basically turkey deli meat (sliced) smothered in a variety of Frank&#39;s. It was accompanied with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and guacamole. The bread was lightly toasted, which was the cherry on top. This sandwich was absolutely awesome and I cannot wait to go back.

I also got a &#39;homemade&#39; brownie on the side, which I saved for later. It was extremely rich, but that is ok with me.

Oh, and free refills.

I don&#39;t know what changed, but oddly enough though this place is always slammed when I&#39;m in these days they aren&#39;t doing as good a job as they used to which leaves me wondering why they are so busy. 

My most recent sandwich here was pretty bad, only half of my sandwich had chicken. And, like my experience at the other location there was basically one of everything that I asked for on my sandwich. Literally, one sliver of onion, one pepperocini, one pickle... one tomato. You get the idea. So by halfway through my sandwich I basically had no insides of it left. The only reason I&#39;m not rating this location as poorly as the Park Meadows is because even though they toasted my sandwich they didn&#39;t turn it into a pile of croutons.

I give up. Which Wich... fix your shit and when you do maybe I&#39;ll be back. Until then, stop trying to be like Subway. You had a good thing going and you fucked it up."

You pick the bag you want 1st- so different categories like meat, breakfast, veggie and so on. I think there are like 13. 
Then you grab a sharpie and mark up the brown bag with toppings and other customizeable items you want on your sandwhich.

Pretty simple: cheese, mustard, veggies- choose it all. 

Then you pay and your bag gets clipped up and they make your sandwhich right there. Reading what you marked off to create your own unqiue sandwhich.

I dig the pastrami with mustard and cheese. Really good!

I mentioned the mistake on my most recent visit, describing to the cashier how my sandwich was &#34;practically inedible&#34;.

The food was solid. We are Thai food snobs and this was excellent. 

We had a few curry dishes, a rice dish, the seafood noodle soup, and some vegetarian spring rolls. All of the food was fresh, well spiced, and packaged well.

Noodles were definitely superior to what you would normally find in this dish. And the shrimp was not over-cooked, which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever experienced anywhere else. Husband had the Tom Yum soup to start with, and it arrived in a large and impressive covered bowl on top of a heating pot. This could be a full meal on its own. Full of vegetables, and medium-high spicy (it&#39;s a spicy soup, no surprise there). Our server warned that the curries tend to be spicier than their other dishes, so husband got his in mild. He later wished he would have tried medium, as it was not overly spicy. Unfortunately, they were out of coconut ice cream, so I&#39;ll have to try that next time. They had Chang and Singha beer, which we saw all over Thailand when we spent two weeks there on our honeymoon. They still have a delivery sign on their window, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s only offered on certain days, or what the problem was with a previous reviewer who couldn&#39;t get delivery.

Back then the food was authentic, hearty, and the best in the Denver metro area. Today I cannot say the same. With a hankering for Thai tonight and both Thai Garden and Pearl of Siam being closed on Monday, we ordered the Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and Papaya Salad for take out from J&#39;s. 

First, they served standard rice where real Thai serves jasmine rice, and the portions were extremely small compared to the others (see my picture of our $26 dinner).  I would go for the portion sizes at Thai Garden. As for the picture, I had placed a small amount of food on a plate already. But bottom line is that the portions were smaller than received at other Thai places. 

The Papaya salad consisted of about a cup and a half of shredded papaya, carrots and too large chunks of tomato. Real authentic papaya salad mashes the tomato in a mortar and pestle along with fish sauce, lime, tamarind and chiles. These were simply big hunks of tomato. This wasn&#39;t even close. No dried shrimp, no taste of tamarind, no peanuts. I had to add my own lime and peanuts at home to make it acceptable.  While the Country Pad Thai was flavorful, it severely lacked in the advertised shrimp and tofu. I&#39;ve had much better at Pearl of Siam. The Panang Curry was tasty, but had the consistency of soup instead of curry. It also had very large chunks of green pepper. Another unacceptable ingredient. Again, I have had much better at the Pearl. 

Bottom line: Having spent 7 years in Thailand, I know Thai food. We may try J&#39;s again, simply because we know what they used to be. Today&#39;s experience made me feel like they have become just another Thai place catering to the &#34;Thai food craze&#34;, skimping on the authenticity only to make an extra buck. I would happily pay more for the J&#39;s of old..."

Seeing how this restaurant had a solid 4 stars out of 193 reviews, who could be wrong?  Well, downhill from the very beginning.  This is a family owned restaurant.  The mom runs the front counter and the daughter waits on the tables.  Food came out super quick.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  That was about the only good part.

My fiancee ordered the Pad Thai (medium spice) and I ordered the Pad Se Eyw (as they spell it/medium spice).  Her Pad Thai rocked! I took and bite and thought &#34;this is awesome!&#34;  Solid presentation and great texture/taste.  I bit into mine and wondered where the flavor was.  So I had to play tarmac operator, stand up in the booth and flag them down. Our waitress gingerly waddled over and I told her there was no taste and no spice.She took the dish to the kitchen and the chef recooked it and added bean sprouts to make it look fresh.  Now the noodles seemed mushy from being twice cooked.  I ended up ordering drunken noodles instead and sending these back.  I was hungry by then and accepted whatever somewhat better taste came my way.

At the end of the meal, I found a hair in my dish. (refer to pictures)  They even tried to charge us for the dish I sent back.  The mom said &#34;Next time you come back, ask for more sauce.&#34;  Seriously?!?!  After you tried to charge us for a meal that was so tasteless that chopping up cardboard would have more flavor?! Not going back and definitely NOT recommending this place.  You have been warned!"

This one is pretty good.  Located on Parker in a strip mall, it doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside.  And guess what, the inside matches the outside !  Pretty plain, not much ambiance.  (I can image the admonishment...&#34;You come here to look at art, or you come here to eat?&#34;)  It&#39;s a mom and pop (and daughter) operation, and I have found the food is pretty good.  Authentic is probably the word to describe it best.  The Pad Thai, (the standard by which I try and gauge the taste quality) is eight out of ten in my opinion.  Service was fast, but the waitress/owner didn&#39;t communicate with much more than two or three words the whole time I was there.  Lunch menu specials are day of the week specific so be prepared to not find your favorite as a special on the day you visit, but the prices are reasonable anyway.

1. Crab cream cheese rangoons
2. Pineapple fried rice with tofu (mild)
3. New Thai vegetable mix with seafood (medium spice)- had shrimp, imitation crab &amp; mussels
4. Custard and black bean sticky rice with coconut ice cream (called sweet lips) 
5. Thai tea $2.50

The prices for entree are around $7-8 and dishes are smaller than I expected compared to other Thai places I&#39;ve tried (though the cheap prices are proportional to its size). If you ask for mild spice it&#39;s not spicy at all. Medium has a good kick. The Thai tea was too sweet for me and they told me that they didn&#39;t have any &#34;good mangos&#34; for the mango sticky rice dish I wanted. Instead I got the Thai custard which was really pleasant. The coconut ice cream wasn&#39;t good because it was made with coconut cream rather than real coconut. The flavor tasted a lot like canned coconut cream. I thought the crab rangoons were tasty and crunchy and weren&#39;t too greasy. The pineapple fried rice was also very good but was much more moist than typical pineapple fried rice I&#39;m used to. The vegetable seafood dish had good flavor and wasn&#39;t too salty or bland. 

The interior is carpeted so it absorbs the sound in the restaurant so it feels quiet and a little awkward inside. It had a very un-restaurant feel to it that I cannot really explain. The owners daughters (?) work there as well and it threw me off that the older daughter carried her purse on her while serving people. It looked unprofessional and was unnecessary for her to carry her purse around while working. Also, her and her mom would openly talk across the room about the orders and business which was awkward because everyone sitting in between, which was everyone...., could hear. So I heard her asking her mom about a customer&#39;s tea order across the room. Our waitress was much friendlier with us after we paid than during the order-taking process. 

You seat yourself and tables are empty with no place settings and plates. I think they could improve by adding paper place settings and plates or by offering to seat you. 

I&#39;ve definitely had better Thai food but I think because the prices here are cheap, it&#39;d be a good lunch option (lunch meals typically below $7)."

The crab Rangoon was fine. The man liked his pad thai. My massamun curry was okay, but it wasn&#39;t the best. It felt like something was missing. Might try it again, but might try other places instead. It was fine, just didn&#39;t wow me."

In regards to her daughter .The  daughter is very shy and young it is a family business. I spoke to the Mother about customer service skills it will be handled in due time. Now back to the food if something is not cooked properly they will re cook it for you or just order another dish if there is a problem with the dish that you ordered just take a few bites and then return it so they can correct it for you if there is a problem with the bill they will definitely take care of that for you also communication is the key to any situation.

For take-out we ordered the Country-style Pad Thai and the New Thai Fried Rice. Both were solid but not exceptional.

The veggie soup was delicious, too, and was filled with green cabbage, carrots, and celery.  I had the green curry for my entree.  I was told the mild green curry is like medium due to the spices of the curry itself.  I ordered it mild and the server was completely correct. The spice was perfect for me.  My friend had the drunken noodles as his entree.  He ordered it medium but it was nothing like my mild. His medium was honestly not spicy at all.  But otherwise, his lunch was delicious too!

Take out experience is sub-par at best.

The parking lot had 0 spots open with several vultures circling around waiting for one to open up.. so I had to park in the employee parking in the back. They said the Pad Thai would be ready in 25 minutes (which already seemed long), it wasn&#39;t. It took 35 while I sat waiting the last 10 minutes.

I asked to pay while I waited. The very young girl behind the counter responds, &#34;Um I&#39;m not sure how much it will be, sorry.&#34; Wait, WHAT? You can&#39;t tell me how much it is before it&#39;s ready? &#34;No, I&#39;m not sure, sorry.&#34; To myself: What have you been doing the last 35 minutes!??

The only redeeming qualities were that I didn&#39;t get mugged returning to my car and my food was good/spicy. 

As far as first experiences go, as a whole, this was disappointing. I don&#39;t plan to subject myself to that again. Perhaps they SHOULD deliver to spare unsuspecting innocents from the pick-up nightmare.

One thing I liked about the cashier, who doubled as waitress, was that she gave new a recommendation for next time on the rice to go with my Bangkok noodles. I ordered the Thai style egg rolls, shrimp Bangkok noodles, and sticky rice with mango. Will always get an order, or three, of the sticky rice. Anyways, while waiting for my order, I noticed the table for two might not hold two people and did. W table looked really small. Plus, when waiting for food, there isn&#39;t a place to sit. What looks like seating against the wall, I don&#39;t think it could hold a full grown adult of any size. But my food can&#39;t very quickly, probably because no one was there.

The Thai style egg rolls were just oversized vegetable egg rolls that you can get at any Asian place. But they were crispy and definitely full. Could have used different sauce then the fish sauce. The Bangkok noodles were very good. I ordered hot, which I could have easily ordered the medium instead. But very very good and would order again. Threw sticky rice was small, not sure if that was because I did a pickup or not. If I eat there, I&#39;m really going the sticky rice is a bigger portion. 

Spent a little more, $23 including tip for lunch then I was expecting. But maybe that&#39;s because I got a couple more items :). Yea I&#39;d recommend. But would not recommend for delivery as it&#39;s a $20 minimum, but free delivery."

We ordered the coconut soup, which they added extra veggies to and we ordered the glass noodle pad Thai which they substituted mushrooms and broccoli for the meat.

My only complaint would be calling in food- several times they have put me on hold, then forget about me. This then means I hang up, but they haven&#39;t, so their phone doesn&#39;t work for several minutes because they left their phone just sitting there.  That gets kind of old after 4-5 times.

My girlfriend and I are regulars because it&#39;s our favorite thai in Denver and we&#39;ve never been let down.

If I&#39;m extra hungry I order extra noodles on my entree because portion sizes here are not massive but i always leave full and happy.

I love family-owned, local places, and I have been missing authentic cuisines since I moved from Minneapolis a year ago. This gives me hope that I can find more small, wonderful little gems in my neighborhood!

We had Thai iced tea, the crab rangoons, chicken pad Thai, chicken red curry, and the mango with black sticky rice. Our whole bill was still under $40, and everything was the best Thai we&#39;ve had! Seriously, if you don&#39;t get the crab rangoons, I don&#39;t know how you will live with yourself!

Just a heads up, they do a scale of one to five for hot, but you can also do a ten if you&#39;re really ballsy. I normally order a three at Thai and Indian restaurants on a similar scale, but the waitress recommended only a two, and she&#39;s wasn&#39;t lying - this spice scale goes from bland to pants-on-fire in 0.2 seconds. My boyfriend got the three and couldn&#39;t finish his whole meal without a second Thai iced tea. Take their spice scale seriously, and if you consider black pepper spicy like I do, do a one or a two at the most!

It is clean and the woman waiting on us was fantastic. We will be back again within the month to try more!"

What is not lame is this place.  The (albeit limited) food I have tried from here has been delicious.  Believe the reviews: Country Pad Thai is fabulous.  The flavor is just SO good!  Made me ashamed to have eaten Pad Thai at places like PeiWei (sorry, dudes).  Crab rangoons are yummy, possibly the best filling I&#39;ve had, and the sauce they come with is a nice, different touch.  The curry puffs are great if you&#39;re a curry fan (don&#39;t worry, they aren&#39;t spicy, just have a really great curry flavor).

Speaking of spicy, they have different levels, which I appreciate.  I got the medium and it&#39;s perfect for me.  Enough to have a kick but I don&#39;t need to make sure there&#39;s milk around before I indulge.

And quite, honestly, it was my last.  I had Tom Yum soup, and though it was plentiful and hot, the flavor was weak, and it was mainly broth--a few tomatoes, pieces of chicken.  Actually, the worse Tom Yum I&#39;ve ever had.

Entrée was Prik Pow Noodles--which was good, but nothing to rave about.  There was one small piece of broccoli, a scattering of mushrooms, but mainly carrots and onions.  Portion was also small for a Thai restaurant. 

Service was poor--even with only a few customers.  

There are way too many excellent Thai restaurants in Denver to return here.  I know they have won many awards, though it seems like their last one was in 2006.  Perhaps they can&#39;t compete with better Thai eateries."

A few of my favorites:

1) New Thai Egg Rolls ($5.95)
2) Country Pad Thai ($8.95)
3) Yellow Curry (Chicken, Potatoes, Bamboo Shoots, Onions) ($7.95)
4) Tom Kha Soup ($8.95)
5) Sticky Rice (This is not on the menu, but you can order it)

The Thai owners (family) are extremely kind and go out of their way to meet their customers and establish a genuine rapport with them. I witnessed the owners hugging several of their repeat customers inside the restaurant. Also, the servers are extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. For example, I wanted Tom Kha soup as an appetizer instead of paying $8.95 for a big bowl, and this was easily accommodated and the price was reduced accordingly. 

So why not 5 stars? I think some of the appetizers are bit on the expensive side. For example, $6 for 2 eggrolls is quite a lot. I have a personal philosophy that no Thai appetizer should be more than $5, and 2 eggrolls should be no more than $4. Just my personal opinion, of course. 

Overall, we&#39;ll be repeat customers, and I assume we will soon be hugging the owners, too...."

Long story short, this is the original owner of the J&#39;s on Federal, though he is no longer affiliated with that restaurant.

The menu is almost identical to the J&#39;s on Federal.  The food was good, but not as good as the J&#39;s on Federal.  I would have given four stars, but the servings were considerably smaller, so much so that I was still a little hungry when I left.  We also ordered the special (the name of which I have now forgotten) which can best be described as a type of catfish custard.  When it arrived, the dish (bowl) was still icy on the bottom from not being reheated thoroughly.  That is two strikes and one star deducted.

Will I be back?  Perhaps, but it is not near the top of my list."

And more often than not I have been disappointed upon following the lead.
After several years and many meals at the lesser popular J&#39;s, my experience has been one of great satisfaction with the each and every preparation.
I eat only vegetarian food, so remain unable to comment on meat and fish items, however, for those who do not wish to have fish sauce, e.g., in their papaya salad or drunken noodles, you will be well served.
My experience with properly prepared Thai food has been &#34;gestalt&#34; like when the combination of flavors blend into a cohesive whole.
There have been very few restaurants where I have had this experience, but am happy to credit J&#39;s Noodles &amp; New Thai for consistently creating what borders on the magical when it comes to this gestalt flavor sensation.
Having eaten at what are considered very fine Thai restaurants in the states and abroad, I am always happy to return home to Denver to dine at J&#39;s.

I mean the restaurant is beautifully located in a beautiful downtown hotel, valet parking is included if you dine here. The bathrooms are a bit out of the way and involves taking the elevators downstairs but up to this point everything was promising. 

I should&#39;ve known to lower expectation when I asked our server if the menu item &#34;White Bass&#34; means Chilean Sea Bass or Colorado Striped Bass (as the difference is miles apart), she responded with a short &#34;Sure!&#34; (WTH does that even mean? I hate it when people answer questions that way). Of course it wasn&#39;t Chilean Sea Bass (even though the price tag suggested it could&#39;ve been) and I&#39;m never impressed with other types of Bass so the dish is a pass for me.

Since we were in the mood for seafood, we also ordered a Pallae. With all sorts of ingredients that scream Umami (shrimp! chorizo!! mushrooms!!!), how did they manage to come up with something so tasteless? I had a ray of hope when I saw this menu item that I&#39;d taste somewhat authentic Pallae, well, the verdict is it&#39;s worse than &#34;Americanized Pallae&#34;. 

At least dessert was better: Warm Chocolate Espresso Cake. But, I really doubt you&#39;d need to be sitting at a fancy hotel for this kind of gooey dessert."

We went to the Range this morning for breakfast. The entire time we were there, I felt like it was an inconvenience, like our presence (and my husband felt it as well) was not wanted, by the staff that we interacted with. I only wanted to eat, and get out of there. I couldn&#39;t get out of there fast enough! 

The table we were seated at, had to be cleared first, no problem. Once we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to drink. We replied coffee with lots of cream and sugar, no problem we were told. Coffee was brought, and the waitress went off again. We waited 3-4 minutes for someone to bring cream and sugar. No sign of our waitress, so we asked another person. We waited another minute or two, but finally got cream and sugar. 

Our waitress came back (eventually), and took our order. We never did get water, actually there were no water glasses on our table, so I guess it really didn&#39;t make a difference, except some water would have been nice.  I looked around at all the other tables, and they all had water glasses.  The young couple next to us, eventually had to ask for water, and they eventually got some.They, at least, had glasses to put the water in.

Our food came, and the waitress asked what else we needed. We replied that we&#39;d like some ketchup and cholula, if they had it. No problem, we were told.  A few minutes later, someone came around the corner and slapped down a small ramekin filled with ketchup, on our table. Literally slapped it down on the table, rather rude.  We started to eat, and eventually our waitress came back (long, long time between visits), and asked if there was anything else that we needed. I asked for jelly, and my husband asked for cholula. The waitress brought me three individual small containers (individual servings) of jelly, very nice. She then said to my husband, &#34;I brought you a new bottle of cholula.&#34; Fine, no problem with that, except that it still had the sealed packing wrapper on it. Give me a break! At least take off the wrapper!

Listening to the young couple next to us, her eggs were not properly cooked. The table two over from that, had been given the incorrect bill.  People had to wait to be seated. It seems the staff were talking more among themselves, then giving the service you would expect from an expensive restaurant. 

As I said at the start, we have been wanting to go to The Range, for breakfast. We have enjoyed our visits there for dinner. My experience this morning was poor, rude, and so disappointing! We will NOT be back to the Range. I don&#39;t know what has changed since we were there at the start of this year (January 2016). Again, it was so disappointing. We discussed going to several other places this morning for breakfast, and passed them all up, because we had high hopes for The Range.  Darn, I wish we had gone to some of those other places instead. Disappointing!"

I was attending a conference at the nearby convention center, and I needed a big breakfast to get me through the day as it wouldn&#39;t be until 2:00 PM or later until I&#39;d have time to grab lunch. 

I had the House Cured Salmon Lox.  I love salmon, but I usually can&#39;t order this dish as I hate cream cheese.  In this version, there was a creamy, light, mild goat cheese in its place.  It also came with a toasted bagel of my choice, tomatoes, red onions, and capers.  The salty capers and fish melded perfectly with the mild goat cheese and fresh veggies. My only complaint is that the onions were a little strong and needed to be soaked in ice water or a little vinegar water first to take away some of that bite. I was greedy and also ordered the Range Home Fries.  I didn&#39;t need them, but I don&#39;t regret ordering them as they were fresh, crispy, well-seasoned and contained plenty of peppers and onions.  

My coworker had the eggs benedict and a side of fruit.  The fruit was a nice variety including fresh melon and berries.  We texted my boss and told him we were having breakfast in his hotel.  He said he was about to go get breakfast himself and asked us to order a cheese omelette for him.  We asked the waitress if that was something she could do, she said no problem, scooted another table next to ours, and asked what kind of side he&#39;d like.  We weren&#39;t sure, so she sent out a beautiful looking omelette that arrived only a few seconds before he did with a side of fruit, toast, and a few greens over a ripe tomato.

I would definitely come back for breakfast and I&#39;d be interesting in trying out lunch or dinner here as well."

So, It seemed pretty gluttonous.   they purported use good local meat as well, but it is very pricey for what you get. Also, for that kind of money, you got to have fries that are better than McDonald&#39;s or at least different than McDonald&#39;s.

FYI, I think it&#39;s $16 for just the burger with homemade potato chips, which were way too spicy for me.   It&#39;s an extra two dollars if you want the McDonald&#39;s type fries."

Positives: They knew our party of 6 was arriving for our reservation and pushed our tables together quickly upon arrival and our server made some great recommendations for apps, which was in line with what I wanted to try - the 3 Little Pigs Board: the fire-toasted bread, candied bacon and salami were truly delicious. Three of us had a Manhattan which was VERY strong and served with its own small bottle for a refill. The truffled french fries were on-point.

The mehs: However, that&#39;s where the deliciousness of the meal ended. I ordered the trofi pasta without protein (since I just ate the pigs board) and the flavor was lacking, I can&#39;t even put my finger on it. I took home leftovers and discovered I didn&#39;t even want to eat them! My boyfriend ordered the short ribs papardelle and it was also lackluster. I wish I could put my finger on it! A few people at our table ordered the bison short ribs and the pork loin and seemed very happy with their orders.

We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and we couldn&#39;t finish it. It simply wasn&#39;t appetizing - it tasted like a fire (which I understand is their theme) and it also wasn&#39;t set up and didn&#39;t have that satisfying crunch on top, and the almond cookie and citrus jam seemed confusing as a side. My friend ordered a chocolate lava cake and it had the same fire-burned taste to it. Just not appetizing. What is going on here!

When the tab came we were feeling a bit too boozy to split it up by couple so we asked the server if he could do it for us - offering a good tip for his effort - and he actually scolded us for not telling him at the beginning of the meal (yes, I agree that would have been easier) and acted annoyed. I have never been a server so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s an inconvenience to re-do a tab for a party of 7, however, I did give him a 25% tip. I can&#39;t remember the last time a server scolded me.

Anyway, I had very high expectations for range. I enjoyed the atmosphere and had a great time hanging with my friends but perhaps I just made bad menu selections all around because I don&#39;t feel motivated to return. Just being honest!

P.S. Free valet parking for 3 hours if you&#39;re just going to the restaurant. That&#39;s a positive."

This review is based on a specific experience today.  I ordered the buffalo pastrami sandwich on the recommendation of the server.  The sandwich showed up, and looked delicious.  But when I picked it up, the bottom piece of toasted bread was wet (huge pet peeve) as if the sandwich was sitting for a quite a while.  Top was crispy and toasted, bottom was soaked.  Ick.  We were in a hurry, so I flipped it over and took off the wet bread and ate the balance with a fork.  It tasted fine, but no cheese since that was on the wet bread.

Server came by and asked how everything was, I told her the bread was wet and I how I dislike that, and she did nothing!  She kind of laughed and said &#34;Wow, and I told you it was crunchy&#34;.  Didn&#39;t offer to bring a replacement (which I didn&#39;t have time for), didn&#39;t offer to take it off the tab, or ever offer a free dessert.

I&#39;m not one to make a scene or complain further, I figured I would simply warn others instead.  The servers at Range have clearly not been trained how to take care of any issue you might have with your meal.  For the prices, there are much better alternatives."

I had low expectations since everyone knows hotel restaurants are usually bad.

I was seated immediately and was pleased to see several vegetarian options on the menu. After speaking to the attentive waiter about my choices, I decided to get both the blistered peppers and the butternut squash hummus.

The blistered peppers came in a big bowl with cauliflower, green and kalamata olives, feta and a smear of romanesco sauce. I love all of these ingredients individually and was thrilled to experience them in the same bowl.

The hummus was topped with pepitas, more feta and jalapenos. I think it was good but honestly I was so enraptured with the peppers that I didn&#39;t savor it as much as I could have. The only thing I didn&#39;t love about the hummus dish was the tostada chips it was served with. They were kinda greasy and flaked all over my lap. Then again maybe I&#39;m just a slob.

I would definitely come here again for lunch to try the grilled mushroom and kale salad."

The service was great. Ambience was also great. Drinks... Great. But unfortunately my blue cheese burger didn&#39;t satisfy my craving. I left over half of it on my plate and called it a night. The good news is that I am traveling back into Denver next week once again and staying at the Renaissance. I will give Taste another shot and update my review accordingly. More to come!

I&#39;ve not really noticed it in the past but since this was the target I had the &#39;uh huh&#39; moment when I found it. 

Somewhat surprising to me was the good happy hour they had. I didn&#39;t know about it but it is definitely on the radar. What wasn&#39;t surprising is that the staff treated us like tourists or out-of-towners for the first part of our visit. I didn&#39;t take offense to it as probably most locals don&#39;t frequent this place. I was here for dinner so it only made sense to grab a drink and catch part of a game while I waited for the rest of the party to show up.

As for dinner, everything we had was fantastic. We started with the Jalapeno Bacon, which a couple people already noted, and it definitely didn&#39;t disappoint. The bruschetta was truly once of the best I&#39;ve had... they did a great job with it! And I went with the waiter recommended pork shank and it was awesome! All in all, excellent spot for dinner!"

We came at noon and literally had the place to ourselves.  Our waiter was really incredible and we pretty much went with every recommendation he made for our meals.

One thing he did not have to mention because I&#39;ve had it before was the habanero bacon - wowza is this bacon on point.  Spicy yet sweet with nice elements of fat in it, it is one to order each and every time you come!

For our mains, we went with the buffalo melt and the never ever burger.  My husband really enjoyed his buffalo melt and my never ever burger was ridiculous good.  We both upgraded to the truffle fries which are some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Washing it all down for me was a Breckenridge Bourbon Kentucky Mule.  I knew from previous experience that Range makes an incredible mule.  

Our trusty waiter recommended the peanut butter and jelly donuts for dessert.  I tend to steer away from desserts in restaurants as they are almost always a disappointment.  To no one&#39;s surprise, the donuts were spectacular.  Perfect doughy thick pillows of donut, drizzled with a peanut butter glaze, honey roasted peanuts, peanut butter whipped cream and a berry compote on the side = perfection."

Our meal and service were subpar and looking through everyone else&#39;s glowing reviews just baffles me. Could we really have been so unlucky?

4 entrees and 2 appetizers, and we had 1 good app and 1 decent meal. 

Appetizers: loaded potatoes and the bacon/pimento fritters. The fritters were awesome. They were really tasty and the ranch that came with it was great. Good flavor, nice consistency.

The potatoes would have been ok, but the actual potatoes were under cooked and a bit mealy. 

Entrees: 
-Hanger steak - our friend ordered this medium rare and there was not a single trace of pink. His potatoes also looked raw. Must be a theme here that night. 
-Grilled portabella mushroom - a new fan of grits, I think the person who ordered this was hoping for something tastier. I kid you not, it looked like she took 2 bites and moved it around. 
-Classic cheeseburger - what could go wrong? Holy eff, that was the driest meat I&#39;ve ever had on a burger. The bun was also overly toasted making the texture even more difficult combined with the dry meat. I ate approximately a quarter of it. The cheeseburger also comes with your choice of side salad or fries. Look, I&#39;ll be honest. I wanted fries, of course, I always want fries, but in the effort of being a little healthier sometimes, I asked about the side salad. The server shrugged and said &#34;it&#39;s a regular salad&#34; Silly me for expecting a &#39;regular&#39; salad.

What I got was shredded lettuce and another green. Kale perhaps? Something a bit more bitter. Sliced radishes, feta, and some weird orange cubed veggie. Was it butternut squash?! I wasn&#39;t sure. This is not what I would consider a &#34;regular&#34; salad, by any means. 

-Pepperoni and jalapeno pizza - the only acceptable dinner dish we got, lucky for my husband. He was actually brought a sausage pizza initially, but once informed it was the wrong dish, the pepperoni appeared rather quickly

Our server went through the motions. No one asked if there was something wrong with the food, which may have been evident by there being so much of it left over. I don&#39;t believe anyone asked if we wanted a box either. 

We should have nixed dinner orders and went with 4 more of the fried pimento cheese fritters."

We walked over to Range because we read online that they had happy hour until 7. The specials were nothing to rave about. We ordered beer and the buffalo chicken sliders to share, it was like blah bar food. Chili&#39;s could make it better. I didn&#39;t really like the dark atmosphere much either.

I went with the butternut squash pizza. which advertised charred butternut, bacon, crispy sage leaves, rapini pesto, bleu cheese, and maple honey.

The butternut had no char, which would have added tremendously to the dish. The pesto was a standard pesto, not a rapini pesto, and instead there was broccoli rabe (rapini) on the pizza. However, I&#39;m not convinced it wasn&#39;t broccolini (baby broccolI) because it lacked any of the bitter character of broccoli rabe. The pesto was very oily and there was a considerable amount of mozzarella in addition to the bleu cheese, which was total overkill and made for a very heavy, greasy pizza. I didn&#39;t eat most of the middle and just picked the toppings off. The basil in the pesto competed too much with the sage and drowned out that flavour. No hint of honey to be found. The dough was underdeveloped and missing the elastic character of a decent pizza dough.

Overall it was pretty disappointing, but I ate most of it. My beer was good and service at the bar was fine. Found myself wishing I had gone back to Guard and Grace for a second night."

I came to try it out because so many other Yelp reviews talked about the Brussels sprouts and it was only a block away from my hotel. They were the highlight of the meal. I went with the shrimp tacos, and while tasty (candied jalapeño nice touch) they paled in comparison to the truffle fries and the phenomenal sprouts. My waitress Amanda was super nice and attentive. She said another customer didn&#39;t feel the sweet contrasted with the sprouts and I disagree COMPLETELY. They are roasted and served with a cider reduction that is just the right amount of sweet along with the apple slices. 

I may be back just for those!"

My wife was not a fan of the wine selection but my Moscow Mules were excellent.  We started with the stuffed potato appetizer.  I feel like we could have made that dish at home with ingredients we commonly keep in our pantry and fridge.  It was simply nothing special.  We indulged with the fried pimento cheese balls next and, like the potato appetizer, were unimpressed.  

Our entrees, on the other hand, were excellent.  My lamb was cooked perfectly and was flavored well.  my wife&#39;s hanger steak was superb.  The complaints we had on the entrees were that the sides were inedible.  My couscous was flavorless and seemed misplaced while her duck fat potatoes should have just been mashed.  The crème brulee was excellent, however, and saved the meal.  Service was good as well, except that halfway through the meal I left to feed the meter and the hostess treated me like a criminal.  I was not dressed like a criminal and like to think that my wife and I do not look or act like criminals."

While they were expertly prepared and very yummy, I don&#39;t think I will be &#34;fancy-ing&#34; up my carnitas with duck again anytime soon.

That said; dinner was delicious.  

We started with the butcher&#39;s board.  The habanero candied bacon is well executed and had me not caring to hide the fact I had sugary goodness stuck on my fingers.  I licked that goodness right off.  No reason to let the napkin take it all.  The pork-chili mixture has a nice savory/sweetness that plays well with the spicy/sweet bacon.  And the salami lollipops, well, you can&#39;t go wrong with meat, ghost cheese, and olives (3 with kalamata, 3 with Spanish green). 

I was torn between salmon and skirt steak for dinner.  When I told our server about my dilemma, she highly suggested the steak, stating the salmon is kind of a basic smoked salmon.  I&#39;m definitely glad I listened and went with the steak.  It was delicious and well cooked.  A little more rare than I&#39;d usually go, but it worked very well.  I did find it odd the bleu cheese was under everything and therefore melted, but it did lend to the flavor.  My Valentine got the meatloaf, which was smoky, moist, and made me rethink my recipe.

We ended with the banana toffee dessert, which was good but VERY sweet (I know, toffee right?) so I was glad for my cup of coffee to balance that out.  Being Valentine&#39;s weekend, they also provided all the ladies with a beautiful red rose when bringing the check.  Nice touch.  I think we&#39;ll have to return and see what their happy hour is about."

One of the neatest things about Range is that it&#39;s located in the recently opened Marriott Renaissance Hotel at 17th and Champa, inside what was the old Colorado Nat&#39;l Bank building. That place is a hundred year old neo-classical white marble masterpiece that is filled with Allan Tupper True frescoes from 1925 (count &#39;em: 16 impressive as-could-be murals in the lobby). By saving that Colorado art the Renaissance has done us all a huge historical and cultural favor. You really should just go in and take a gander, even if you&#39;re not going to go into the restaurant. This is a special (semi-) public space in our city which you can enjoy for free.

That said, the Range is worth your time and money, too. It&#39;s low hard ceiling&#39;ed and so somewhat noisy, but the food--while ala carte pricey--is 4 star good.

Had a delicious cold leek soup starter followed by a wonderful Berkshire pork loin in caramel whisky sauce over grits and roasted grapes (!) with Brussels sprouts the other night and it couldn&#39;t have been better or more creative. A fairly priced pinot gris from the Willamette Valley Winery was a bit unusual match but a tasty accompaniment.

All-in-all a stylish, kinda pricey, new high-end dining selection for local foodies, business-folk and travelers."

The place didn&#39;t have a lot of people and it did feel like a typical hotel restaurant with the few business travellers but I am sure during the weekend it is busier or as people try their menu.

The staff was friendly and attentive and the menu very interesting. Some of the entrees were expensive but there are plenty of options to pick from with smaller dishes, flat breads and appetisers that were perfect for us as we wanted to try a few things.

We shared a rabbit stroganoff that was simply delicious, rich, and definitely a must have. We also tried the scallops and the tuna both also great, light and fresh and we shared a side of truffle fries. 

We were very full at end but saw some very well presented desserts that looked delicious."

You can try lots of Colorado fare in a beautiful environment without the risk of taking your guests somewhere they won&#39;t be able to find something to eat.

I went with a couple of business associates from the Mid West and they were both happy with everything to do with our meal. We ordered a bottle of wine from the monthly special, it was fine nothing amazing but very passable. We did not order a starter but did all get salads. I had the house salad with the vinageret dressing and was pleased. The dressing was thicker than I expected and they didn&#39;t bring out a whole tub to pour over the bowl it was just enough for people who like a heavy dressing but not so much that it turned into a bowl of dressing soup.

For the main course I had the Colorado lamb because I am not an idiot and I knew it would be wonderful. It was. I totally won the who ordered the better dinner contest.  We were talking business so I didn&#39;t ask for a detailed description of my guests meal but they seem to enjoy the scallops and the fish they ordered. The Lamb was tender and cooked medium rare to perfection. If you like a pink center go for medium. Medium rare is exactly what it says. Medium on the outside and rare but warm in the middle. I did not think the accoutrements added to the dish the meat really spoke for itself. 

Dessert, because why not, was the strawberry jar. It was tasty but not something that i am going to dream about. It was a great size for splitting on a date."

It was a bit weird walking into a lobby of a hotel that we weren&#39;t staying at to have dinner but the reviews and pics from my fellow yelpers gave me strength to try something new. 

The attire was a mix of dressy casual and wayyyy casual. We were seated right when we walked in.

Selections of apps to share, apps for yourself, and main dishes.  Great wine and local beer selection. 

We got the bacon jam flat bread to start and it was tasty. A bit thin on the toppings though.  

For my main course I had the scallops that were served on this sweet potato purée and the combination was very delicious. One of  the best scallop dishes I&#39;ve had. 

Too bad the jalapeño peppers and the beef carpaccio were so tasteless.

The dessert made us happy again: the decadent smores tart.  The marshmallow top was slightly burned and really elevated the dessert&#39;s flavors.

To sum up: my main dish was great but the appetizers and other small dishes were less than desirable.  Although service was quick, it was TOO quick. I felt like the wait staff wanted us out of there: she kept asking if we were ready to order before our appetizers came which is a nice dining no no."

Rest assured, this has no influence on the restaurant, after all it&#39;s within the lavish and classy Renaissance Hotel.  There are two ways to enter the restaurant, the side door placing you at the bar and through the hotel&#39;s main entrance that I recommend as a scenic route.  The hotel lobby is simply astonishing, and this route leads to the hostess podium.  The interior is equally impressive, it boasts a modern and dashing decor.  I was politely greeted; eating alone, I was offered a table or a bar seat.  I wanted to experience the table service, so I chose a table.  I did take a glimpse of the bar and it appeared spacious and well stocked with local beers, spirits and wines. Speaking of bars, the Renaissance Hotel lobby bar, at the entrance to the restaurant, is unbelievable, the bar surface lit up like a white glow stick.  I believe one is able to dine there and be served by the restaurant as an option; in hindsight I wish I did.

The waitress appeared and with enthusiasm offered me information on the menu.  After a few minutes I decided on the Colorado Lamb Sirloin.  When ordering I didn&#39;t see a simple side salad on the menu, so the waitress offered to have the chef prepare one for me without a fuss.  The house salad arrived first and it was an indication of the entree to come, excellent in every way.  The crispy variety of produce, olives and shredded carrots with a spicy ranch dressing was quite a treat for a simple side salad.  The lamb arrived perfectly cooked to order and its presentation resembled and matched the restaurant&#39;s and hotel&#39;s striking decor.  The charred exterior with wonderfully tender interior, lying atop a bed of garbanzos and carrot confit, garnished with red peppers, feta, olives and encircled with green garlic yoghurt was perfection.  The flavors were complementary, including their textures.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.  The waitress was equally devine and I&#39;m glad she made this recommendation from the two options I presented to her.

I had a scanty lunch, so dessert was in order.  I went with the waitress&#39; recommendation and ordered the Nutella Crack Pie.  Basically, it was a rich dark chocolate brownie with a cracked crunchy layer garnished with Nutella sauce.  Accompanying, served in a jar, was a thick mousse that eased the sweetness of the pie and the crunchy texture.  Towards the end, I found myself scraping the jar&#39;s interior with my spoon, yearning for more.  The dessert was a perfect ending to a fabulous dinner.  Next time I hope to try their flat breads baked in a wood fire oven, that everyone is raving about."

Starters - breaking bread is tasty and light. Grilled japs ok but disappointed they weren&#39;t more flavorful or spicy - or is that a Texan complaining Colorado doesn&#39;t know spicy? Guac was fine, it&#39;s guac, what can you say about it.  

Black bean soup was thick and had a lot of flavor. Nice. 

Chicken pan roast for main. It was a little dry. For some reason the broccolini had been chopped into tiny bits with only a few on the plate (are we running out of broc and trying to stretch what&#39;s left, guys?) Sauce was cloying and entirely unnecessary.

I will be back to make a real review based on a &#34;typical&#34; dining experience, but I can&#39;t NOT give this place the shining accolades it deserves.

1) Drinks are strong and tasty. Even the water was flavored/infused with orange and mint. (the centennial mule here is kickin&#39;! I was feeling pretty good after the first one.)

2) THE BACON. It deserves a review all on it&#39;s own. Thick. Peppered. Crisp. and then glazed with a jalapeno jam or something (for a slightly sweet and a def. hint of heat with every bite). I asked the manager to make sure that their bloody maries included the bacon. And for a brekkie sandwich with it. Or a BLT. Or really, anything.

*so, if someone near and dear to you loves them some bacon? bring them here*

3) Every bite of their food is well thought out and tasty. I tried their Boulder Elk Sausage (a tiny piece) b/c it was there. I didn&#39;t expect to like it. But oh oh oh YUM. 

4) GET the bread board ($5) for two popovers and two chive biscuits. Served with some honey and a pat of butter with herbs on top. 

5) We shared: Endive Pear salad (perfectly balanced with the acid from the lemon vinaigrette, candied pecans, pomegranate seeds), the semolina gnocchi (A MUST HAVE. Perfect pillows of potato cakes served with a smoky sauce. Favorite dish of the night. It&#39;s also quite substantial). Entrees: teres major (steak) served with creamed kale, horseradish, and a bunch of tiny potatoes. Heirloom squash tortelloni served with mushrooms, pine nuts, and more kale. Desserts: Nutella crack pie (mmm) and the creme brulee. CREME BRULEE. Get it. It&#39;s served in a bowl so that there is a terrific ratio of crunch brulee to the creme.

Excellent service. Excellent food. Great atmosphere. I can&#39;t wait to come back for brunch."

One of our coworkers was downtown with his wife celebrating.  Needless to say, he was pretty crunk himself. 

&#34;Tom, where the F are you?!?&#34; &#34;My apartment, where are you??&#34;  He answered in a slur, &#34;The Range!&#34;  I am thinking to myself what in the hell is the range, he could have meant a shooting range, a mountain range, hell, he could have been sitting on an oven range in an alley for all I knew.  &#34;It&#39;s on Champa and 18th, nice place&#34;.  He was hammered, I wasn&#39;t necessarily sober either.  So I put on my camo hoodie, and started walking, hoping to find this place.  

My roomie and I finally found the place, looks like it was nestled inside the Renaissance Hotel.  I called him again, to ask where he was sitting.  He said the corner.   Wow, since this place had like 10 corners (it&#39;s possible).  

So we enter, and tell the hostess our friends are here.  As we look damn near everywhere, people are wondering what a camo man is doing in the lobby of a nice hotel on Valentine&#39;s.  At this point, I was thinking it was all games.  Low and behold, our drunk coworker runs into us. He showed where he was sitting, which actually was a corner right near the bar! We had our own little nook.  

The place is swanky, and you know what, they didn&#39;t give me the boot. I&#39;ll take it!  In our corner, they had small tables, and short stools covered in cowhide.  I wanted to take pics, but it was pretty dim. 

They had ordered a meat and cheese plate, also a bread plate.  I loved the presentation and flavor on both.  The pickled veggies that came with it were fresh and clean tasting, which I am hard to please when it comes to pickled foods.  

Our server (I forgot his name) was very friendly and attentive.  He kept bringing us Budweisers and tequila.  I am just glad we were ALL walking that night!

The crazy thing is when we left, the staff gave us high fives and hugs, like we were VIP.  I could only imagine what happened here before we got there.  Ha.  

This seems like a cool place to have a date night or what not.  I wish I could have paid more attention to the menu or drink items.  

But I remembered enough to get a review out of it, so it had to have been decent!  Will have to def go back on more sober terms!"

I had the Kale Cesar salad and the Mushroom Pizza.  That was worth 5 stars.  We paid cash and card and the waiter made the mistake of charging the whole amount on my card and keeping the money.

Had the endive salad and it was delicious, the candied walnuts were insane, perfect balance of dressing, cheese, not to big not too small. 

The lobster risotto was nice, though the lobster was a little rubbery.  My friend had the scallops which were perfectly cooked.

As a non meat eater there were some challenges navigating the menu but hey..that&#39;s what the drink list is for, right?

the berry sage rum concoction was interesting and not overly sweet.  The (red) zinfandel on their wine list is very good.  Biegnets for dessert a fun presentation with chocolate dipping sauce and gelato.

The restaurant wasn&#39;t even half full and was nice and quiet with a decent ambiance..still had a slightly affiliated-with-a-hotel vibe and playlist but pleasant enough.

It is adjacent to the new Renaissance which has a BREATHTAKING lobby of an old bank. They even have a dining room inside a vault (not sure if it is affiliated with the restaurant or not).  But were I do do it over again, I would make sure that I had a drink in the lobby before dinner, it really is remarkable.  Or in the vault if you can!"

My husband and I visited with expectations of good food, but what we got really exceeded our expectations. For apps, I got the oxtail gnocchi and my husband got the pear and endive salad. Okay.....WOOOOOOOOO. That gnocchi was one of the best things I have EVER eaten. I had to basically clutch the table to keep from moaning out loud and embarrassing my husband to death. 
For entrees, I had the bbq pork belly with spaghetti squash, and he had the chicken dish with house sausage and cassoulet beans. Everything was perfectly seasoned and had really interesting flavor combinations. I appreciate the rustic, full flavors of the food. 
For dessert, I had the most amazing vanilla bean crème brulee with kumquat jelly. My husband had the rich, crazy awesome &#34;crack pie&#34; with this freaking thick whipped cream that I could drink by itself. 
We were so full that you could have rolled us out of there, but I cannot WAIT to go back. I could eat this food all the time. Also, I appreciate the free valet.

I have tried all three varieties and though it is a very tough call, my favorite is the one with the bacon jam. It&#39;s a tie between the sausage one and the artichoke and kale. My other favorite item is the man candy--also known as candied bacon. It&#39;s a delicious piece of thick cut smoked bacon that is candied and has a little heat (crushed red pepper maybe). It is so good that I actually went in there just for that this weekend. I haven&#39;t had a whole meal yet, but I&#39;ll be back soon and will write an update.

First and foremost, if you like bacon you have to order the jar of habanero bacon off the bar menu. It was amazing. Just as a heads up it is served cold. This didn&#39;t take away from the taste at all it just threw us off for a second. 

Secondly, the flat breads are killer. The bacon jam flatbread was awesome and the crust was doughy without being a true pizza.

Finally the building is really neat. If you have a minute you should walk around as its within an old bank and they have all the old vault doors still in place. Only problem was the bathroom was a floor below and not in the restaurant - completely manageable just kind of a pain."

We were talking. I had a draft beer from the very small selection. What is up with that? I had the Cubano with Kale Cesear. It was good except the pieces of kale were to large. They got stuck in my throat. Come on people Kale needs to be cut up finer and massaged to break down the fibers. Kale should be smaller and massaged or it is tough. The sandwich was good. Tasty. My friend had the pastrami and liked it. 2 hours went by in a flash.

First, it&#39;s in the renovated Colorado Bank &amp; Trust Building, which is absolutely gorgeous inside.  Part of the Renaissance Hotel.  Apparently both the hotel, and this restaurant, opened in 2014, but they have been relatively quiet about it (I told the wait staff they need a new PR/marketing firm).  :)  Anyway, on the restaurant itself - great staff, great wine and drink list and unique food offerings. Our table had the land &amp; sea board with a great smoked trout dip, then onto plank roasted prawns and I had the homemade pasta small plate.

Our Hotel was down the street and we decided to try this restaurant based upon its reviews. We entered the restaurant from the outside street and not through the lobby. It was kind of slow(to my surprise) and our server had a little more time to spend some time with us an enlighten us on their menu. 
The food was unreal. So inspiring and so tasty. I loved how the menu infused a lot of sweet and spicy with a nice balance of both. Nothing was too overpowering. We were only in denver for a few days however, we ate here three times. Twice in one day actually. If you are staying near by it is worth it to go in for breakfast.

I was really craving Snooze but didn&#39;t want to walk that far from the hotel and sit close to a lot of people. I chose Range because it was in the hotel and not very crowded.

Looking to impress and the range came through! Fantastic, attentive service. Our waitress recommended a red blend that we both loved. We started with the Field &amp; Stream Board along with the Breaking Bread and I would highly recommend the former. The bread was good but the Field &amp; Stream board was unique and delicious! I can only speak for my entree but I had the Cedar Plank Shrimp &amp; Grits....unbelievable.

It has the standard &#34;rustic&#34; look that has popped up in restaurants recently. Lots of wood and exposed lightbulbs. As for the food, it was just okay. We started with the &#34;Breaking Bread&#34; appetizer which was pretty boring. I&#39;ve had better &#34;free bread&#34; at other places. The butter was too hard to even spread on the bread and the honey was nothing special. For my entree, I choose the buffalo meatloaf. It started out pretty good but by the middle, the BBQ-like sauce on top became too much and overpowering. Plus, I realized there there were jalapenos throughout the meatloaf which gave it an unnecessary kick. Our server was good and they did make a decent vodka martini but overall Range missed the mark for me."

We were here last year and had such a good dinner we vowed o come back, but never made it again till now. We were a party of 4 with reservations. We were seated promptly and had excellent service. I ordered the chickpea fritters, rock shrimp as appetizers. The fritters were okay, very similar to polenta fries and didn&#39;t stand out much, the accompanying feta and olives were wonderful. I ate far too many! The shrimp were cooked to perfection and succulent! They had a lovely glaze and were so good, I could have eaten a plate of them as my entree. My main course were the vegetable enchiladas. These were a bit disappointing. They were bland and not really packing the flavor, so I didn&#39;t finish to leave room for more. They really needed more seasoning. I couldn&#39;t really taste the tomatillo at all. For desert I had the lemonaid cake. Wow, so good I had to force myself to slow down so I wouldn&#39;t scarf it down. The rest of my table had the hangar steak and the lamb. They all raved about how good they were. I would come back to try some other items. It would be great if they expanded their vegetarian selections a bit. Cheers!"

Overall, the experience was good, though a bit overpriced. 

We started with the &#34;Breaking Beard&#34; appetizer, which had 2 portions of the chive drop biscuits &amp; 2 portions of the cheddar popovers. The biscuits were delicious, but the cheddar popovers were average.  The butter &amp; local honey that came with the app was great.  A good start, but not worth the $6 price. 

For the main course, I choose the pork tenderloin, which was amazing.  The dish came with a large portion of pork, accompanied by a sweet whiskey caramel sauce, bacon, brussel sprouts &amp; grits.  The grits were rich &amp; creamy and a great balance to the pork. The sauce added a lot of flavor to the dish as well.

My husband, who ordered the Cedar River NY Steak, was less impressed with his dish. His steak was cook well and had a nice sauce, but there was too much fat on the cut of meat he received. His sides, an under cooked kale and simple baby potatoes, were not very impressive.

The wood fired pineapple tart dessert was a nice finish to the meal. It came with coconut rum gelato, which was delicious. 

Even with the $50 living social deal, our bill came to over $100 (with tip).  While the food &amp; service were both good, it wasn&#39;t worth this price."

They have a nice cocktail and beer selection to begin with and a number of palate pleasing apps and salads. We started with the kale Caesar Salad. It needed to be marinated a bit longer as it was still a bit too tough but it was serviceable. The corn bisque was excellent- definitely the best thing we had! The cavatelli was interesting and good, but not our favorite, yet it was well-made. The burger was quite good and cooked exactly as ordered. The mushrooms on the burger were fantastic!

The meal was excellent.  I started with smoked lobster risotto and went on to the braised venison over orange zested mashed potatoes with a yummy dark reduction.

Although the wine, pan fried chicken, and the service were all fine, we left seriously disappointed and will not return. The pan fried chicken had good flavor and a nice crisp on the outside, but that was the only high note of the meal. The black eyed peas were unnecessary and didn&#39;t add anything to the pan fried chicken dish. The cornbread in the pan fried chicken dish was hard, flavorless, and fairly inedible. Do NOT order the ricotta cavatelli pasta. It may sound delicious, but do not be mislead, it is one of the worst dishes I have ever had! The flavor was terrible and the pasta was not al dente, but rather crunchy and uncooked. In general everything was overpriced. Skip this one."

Had lunch there with a friend once.  It took them over an hour to bring our food (a pizza and a salad).  A frustrated manager came out and comped the meal.  Which would have been nice had it not been followed by a stern warning that we should never ever expect a free meal from them again.  We didn&#39;t even ask for a manager or to be comped!  So I am not sure what that was all about.  

Recently, went there with a large group.  Most people ordered burgers, most of them on the rare side.  Every single one of the burgers came well-done.  Only one waitress served us, and of course had trouble keeping  up.  A bunch of the employees kept coming out, assessing the tables, and then walking away without doing anything.  A random server would refill my water glass, but not my companion&#39;s.  They obviously have a team-dynamics and training issue."

I had a southwest style black bean soup which was just slightly spicy and wonderful, and lamb meatballs that were brought out in a small cast iron pan with polenta.

The wait staff were friendly, helpful and service was great. The food was extremely flavorful.  We shared two salads because we couldn&#39;t decide: the organic kale caesar was a delight and the spinach &amp; quinoa chopped salad was equally as delicious - we were glad we got both.

I had the Skuna Bay Salmon for my entree and it was phenomenal. My colleague had Mary&#39;s chicken and said that he couldn&#39;t believe how much flavor was packed into the dish.

I was here yesterday and ordered prepared oysters, 4 different tacos, mixed ceviche, and elotes. My friends were hesitant on ordering oysters from a taco joint but I didn&#39;t care. The oysters turned out to be amazing! They were tipped with shrimp ceviche and most importantly, they were fresh and clean! We were all very impressed. 
As for tacos, we had Asada, carnitas, chorizos, and lengua. The lengua are a must! I thought the meat was going to be chewy but it turned out to be super soft and they melt in your mouth!
The reason for my 4 stars is because they forgot to bring out our elotes.. We didn&#39;t remember until the next morning because we were so full at the time.

I tried crispy chicken Katsu ramen with shoyu broth ($12). The broth was nicely savory, flavorful and clean. It may have been a little on the salty side but not enough to bother me. Noodles were fine but the real winner in the soup was the crispy chicken katsu - it was delicious all on its own but with the yummy, savory broth? Mmm, mmm, mmmm!!!!  

All in all, Tycoon offers solid ramen that&#39;s more on the authentic side. I would go back if I happen to be in the neighborhood. 

Service was great and prompt.  The décor could use a little work I think... not sure what they were aiming to achieve there - nice eclectic light fixtures but they seemed disjointed with practically naked walls and tables set up in a mall food court style.  After sunset, walk in groups and park on the north side of Colfax if you can.  South side gets sketchy real fast."

Or the &#34;I&#39;m so drunk, it&#39;s 2 AM, and nothing sounds good except for ramen with a shit ton of hot sauce and cut up hot dogs&#34; kind of ramen.

Don&#39;t judge me.

Much like pho, good ramen starts out with a nice tasty broth.  A rich broth that has just enough flavor to both coat the noodles and provide a tasty river of warmness for your throat down to your stomach for a filling morsel of goodness.

Tycoon does just this with their lobster ramen.  Did I just say that?  Yes I did.  Ramen with LOBSTER in it.  Nothing new I know, but hot damn! When I was younger, I never thought of putting lobster in my ramen.  Big ole chunks of baby lobster thrown in with a wonderful brothy goodness of ramen. $18 sure, but oh so good.  I&#39;m no sucka. Trust me.

They have a lot of other good Asian fare, with big portions.  Enough to take home, but I am always ridiculously hungry.  Like all the time.  Do I need a box?  Probably not.  Should I take one?  Probably. Nom nom nom.

Nothing over the top, so I can&#39;t give 5 stars, but service is wonderful and the location can&#39;t be beat.

The miso ramen was one dimensional, noodles were okay but it was strangely served without chashu but with these funky aged tofu chunks instead.

The pieces are on the small side but they are made with great care and almost all  of the pieces we had were accompanied by a light sauce on it or some sort of additional item such as a micro green or small piece of fried garlic.

 I can not review the ramen as we ordered a bowl but there was a hair in it and we sent it back before trying and decided to go with more sushi instead.  It looked good minus the hair.

If you like spicy food and can handle fire, try it out:)! I also ordered the takoyaki and seaweed salad for starters. The takoyaki was alright I have definitely had better.

I like the taste, the aroma, the overall experience of eating it as a whole.  I&#39;m relatively new to the dish, having only eaten it at about a dozen spots.  Some good some bad some awesome some not-so-awesome.

Brought the lady here on a chilly evening before attending an Avs game.  We were both hungry and a bit stuffed up with whatever lovely viral or bacterial thing was going around that week.  She loves ramen as well, and we both ordered accordingly.

My ramen was tasty, a bit spicy, filling, and full of a perfect broth that helped a sore throat and stuffy nose.  Hers was spicier (that&#39;s her jam), which she added more spice into.  Her tempura side was crispy and worked well with the ramen she paired it with.

We both had a beer and water, beer was usual Asahi.

Staff was great!  Our waiter was obviously enjoying himself, practically dancing around as he took orders, brought checks, checked up on tables, and balanced large orders, all with a wink and a smile.

Only real complaint was it was HOT inside.  Everyone was wearing their final layer of clothing, having stripped their jackets, hoodies, or sweaters off.  It was quite warm, not unbearably so, but still uncomfortably so.

Price was decent, food was pretty solid, staff was great.  Dining room is a bit small, so good be difficult for groups larger than 4 to get situated.

Location is a bit iffy, but that&#39;s the neighborhood.  Keep your eyes about you, so &#34;no, sorry&#34; to the drunks across the street at the liquor store hassling people, and move on your way.

Will probably be back at some point."

The menu has been posted on the door for weeks and it&#39;s.... expansive. When it comes to Ramen you want 5 menu items and nothing more. This is Chinese, Thai, and Sushi on one giant menu.

My wife and I both went for the Ramen. To my shock, it was really (really) good. I ordered the breaded chicken Tonkatsu and asked them to add some spice. I received the perfect level of heat. The chicken was plentiful and really tasty. The noodles maintained their texture instead of turning into the mush so many Ramen places put out. My wife&#39;s experience with the Tonkatsu was similar.

My only gripe: the Ramen is expensive (~$12). Like Tokio or Uncle expensive, but the ambiance and menu design doesn&#39;t fit the bill.

Still the quality is high enough that we&#39;ll be back. Our neighborhood needed good Ramen and Tycoon delivers."

It&#39;s not Tycoons fault the Mexican restaurant failed. Anyway I am so glad we gave it a try! The food was awesome! Our service was stellar. The place looks way better than it looked when it was the Mexican restaurant! My husband and I left saying we need to come back to try everything else! I will say there prices can get a little steep but it is all in what you order and the time of the day. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try though!

I came here really for the Ramen. I love ramen and have tried many places. I had high expectations like I normally do. I got the pork belly ramen. I always try the broth first. The broth is what makes the Ramen good. To my disappointment the broth was super super salty with no flavor. I had a hard time finishing this because I hated it that bad.

The entire experience here wasn&#39;t the best with the stench of the street and the beggars in front but I could&#39;ve gotten past that if the staff were friendly and the food was good, unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case.
For a half empty restaurant the service was lacking and neither what appeared as the owner or sushi chef had a nice thing to say or even a smile, and the food really lacked in flavor.  The Tempura Ramen was far from authentic.  I could go to a fast food restaurant for the same type of breaded shrimp.  The broth was super bland, (watered down) and was luke warm as well.

 friendly and courteous service, relatively quick and the prices average. I&#39;m personally a huge fan of both in enoki mushrooms and corn in Ramen and every Ramin option  has both of those ingredients so I&#39;m a happy camper.

I went here on a date and was a bit hesitant about this place since it was located on Colfax. It was a Saturday night and this place was packed! Luckily there was seating at the sushi bar and we gladly accepted. 

The Ramen Selection was small but reading all the descriptions, they all sounded really good. I ordered the Sukiyaki Ramen. It was pretty decent. The only thing that I thought was odd was that there was corn in it. Definitely different but actually tasted really good with the Ramen. We also ordered some nigiri sushi which was good and fresh as well. 

The only downside about this place was the service and parking. For how busy it was, there were only two servers working the floor. It made me feel really bad. We still tipped our server over 20%.

But here are a few suggestions.
If you see 8 (eight) pieces of a 12 piece sushi roll untouched, you may want to ask why - especially if the customer says - that was no good when asked if they want a to-go box.
Make an attempt to provide a meal with no onions when asked twice - No onions - during ordering (and the waitress even says it back).
Provide fresh enough fish for sushi so the roll doesn&#39;t taste like a &#39;fishtank&#39; (I had one piece of spicy yellowtail and was tempted to spit into my napkin)
Try to clean enough between making rolls so the fishiness, fishtank taste doesn&#39;t transfer over to the veggie roll.

We finally tried it last night.... And it was just meh... To preface this review every new ramen restaurant gets compared to Uncle and their Spicy Chicken Ramen, which we believe is the best Ramen in Denver! 

We started with a rainbow roll and shrimp/vegetable tempura. The tempura was excellent, the rainbow roll was ok with very thin slices of sashimi, not worth the $11.

I had the spicy tonkotsu and my wife had the spicy miso.  The portions were decent and the broth had good flavor but in the end it was lacking something compared to Uncle.  It wasn&#39;t great but it wasn&#39;t terrible.

Service was good but unfortunately there was the &#39;hole in the wall&#39; odor that wasn&#39;t appealing...

My partner agreed, so I don&#39;t think it was just me. We stayed because I checked the restrooms and they were clean, so we agreed we wanted to taste their ramen and handled the smell. Never got used to it, but we ate anyway. Their tonkotsu ramen was good. There is more authentic tasting ramen around, but this wasn&#39;t bad. The one major drawback was the thick, curly style noodles. Tonkotsu ramen should have thin, straight noodles (try the tonkotsu at Katsu Ramen and you&#39;ll know what I mean), but other than that, I really liked it. Best ajitama I&#39;ve had yet. Can&#39;t seem to get that right at Katsu. You usually get just one naruto in a ramen. There were about five in mine, and it made me very happy. I say try this place.

We tried the chicken and the tonkastu ramen. The tonkastu broth was weak, not the unctuous flavor explosion you hope for. The meats were mildly overcooked and the eggs were completely hardboiled. Enoki mushrooms were mentioned, I think I saw 1 or 2 individual strands floating in there? Did not hold a candle to the ramen at Sushi/Izakaya Den. Some of the prices seemed out of line too ($19 for a seafood ramen; Sushi/Izakaya Den does this for $~14 I believe and it&#39;s fantastic). 

Did I mention the frozen god damned corn in the both? I&#39;ve yet to meet the person who likes a spoonful of cheap, walmart-esque thawed corn in their ramen. 

It&#39;s not -bad-, and the service was very friendly. But it sure as hell didn&#39;t live up to the &#39;5 star destination ramen!&#39; yelp reviews."

As a new spot near my home, I was very much hoping it would meet my expectations and be delicious. We ordered takeout and got the spring rolls, crab and cheese wontons, pork belly ramen, and the combination drunken noodles. The crab and cheese wontons were the highlight; however, if you mess up crab and cheese wontons then there&#39;s something severely wrong. The spring rolls were ok. The peanut sauce was better than most that I&#39;ve had, but the spring roll wrappers were too sticky and almost gummy. The filling was comparable to most other Asian eateries I visit. 
For the entrees, let me first start with the ramen. Wtf? They put a hard boiled egg in the ramen!! This is blasphemous to me. If I wanted ramen with a hard boiled egg, I would make a pack of maruchen and throw one in myself. For the rest of the dish, the pork belly was cooked fine (hallelujah); the corn tasted like it came from a can; the ramen noodles themselves most likely did come from a twenty-five cent supermarket pack. The broth was ok- it&#39;s flavor was good, but it was nothing exceptional. This dish certainly does not deserve the $14 price tag it was given. 
Now for the drunken noodles. I don&#39;t know about y&#39;all, but typically when I have drunken noodles the noodles are the nice wide and flat ones. These weren&#39;t. They were skinny like that used in pad Thai (rice noodles I think). The dish was not spicy AT ALL. Moreover, there was nothing else in it except meat- no vegetables that I could find in my serving. I don&#39;t know why this dish is even called drunken noodles. 
So overall, this place gets the Dyson award. Meaning, it sucks. Despite the location being great, I will make the longer drive to my favorite (and more appetizing) restaurants. 
One positive, I gave this place one star for the service. Everyone was very courteous and helpful for the two minutes I was there picking up food."

Upon walking in and getting seated we noticed a terrible smell..... Smelled like their drains needed to be cleaned. Not what you want to smell when your about to eat. 
We still decided to give it a try we ordered some sushi and some ramen. Ramen tasted ok but nothing that would have me come back. Sushi didn&#39;t taste fresh, very sub par sushi compared to many other places.
As far as service goes....my husband&#39;s soda was empty and my niece&#39;s water was empty and they didn&#39;t noticed even when coming to pick up the dishes. Was giving them a chance but ended up having to ask them to refill it. Waitresses seemed much more interested in their phones rather than the customer.

Premium bar selection, and a great staff if you are looking for ideas.

I look forward to reviewing the food in more depth and introducing family / friends and out of town guests.

Cooler than chain restaurants and friendly enough to feel local.

Just had brunch with the folks. At first glance, this place has it all.

Plus side: Our server was friendly and professional. The design is nice in a focus-grouped-Hollywood-cool-template kind of way. Good table layout, lots of space, not too loud.

The weakness here is the food. It looks great in print but in execution and flavor, the menu is only a hipster step up from Denny&#39;s. 

The biscuits and gravy plate had some interesting herb combos (I loves my rosemary in my breakfasts), but the chorizo and jalapeno gravy made my lips pucker with the taste of vinegar from the jarred jalapenos. The scrambled eggs were REALLY greasy (I can still taste the griddle oil in my mouth as I write this - yick). 

My mom had a bowl of green chile (all sauce, no pork) and my dad had the pastrami sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both said they were average. Since they live in the building, they&#39;ve tried T Street a few times before, but have never been more than moderately impressed with the food.

This is a good place for a lunch meeting or cocktails where tasty food isn&#39;t the focus."

When we arrived the restaurant wasn&#39;t as busy as I had expected but that worked in our favor. My fiancé and I were running about 15 minutes behind but when we walked in our friends were easy to spot.  

We were greeted promptly by the server. If anything I think she was a little too attentive which isn&#39;t necessarily a compliment but she was helpful and quick with our orders for both food and drinks.  I had the peach mule - delicious!  Everyone else had beers and there were no complaints.  

For dinner I had the mac and cheese burger - cue mouth watering - this was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had!  Chipotle sauce,  fried mac and cheese and a juicy burger served on a fluffy bun = heaven.  I ordered the house made ranch chips as my side and those were lovely as well.  Both of the guys had the pastrami sandwich and before I was even halfway done with my burger his was gone! My friend had the rib eye which looked tasty as well.  To end the night our friends had a cookie dough cheesecake which made me regret not ordering a desert. I will be sure to save room for dessert next time!"

First. The restaurant LOOKS great, very upscale design. But the food is only maybe a step or two above chains like Applebee&#39;s. Every item is also priced approximately $3-$5 more than what it should be. It gets a pass because it&#39;s &#34;Belmar good,&#34; but Belmar has a way of distorting reality. (i.e., the construct of an &#34;urban area&#34; yet music is piped in from outdoor speakers. This is not real life.).

Second. &#34;Roadhouse?&#34; Nothing about this place is a &#34;roadhouse.&#34; It&#39;s a sandwich-and-salad joint, not a country-music-playing grilled-meat house. It has frittatas...FRITTATAS! Roadhouses have neon beer signs and peanut shells on the floor. T Street has tufted banquettes and an elegant color palette, for god&#39;s sake. 

If you work in or near Belmar, T Street is a decent option to have. At least it&#39;s something other than Baker Street, am I right? Just don&#39;t be fooled by its good looks and high-ish prices into thinking it&#39;s authentically upscale or high quality. It isn&#39;t *bad*...it&#39;s just basic and overpriced."

Hubby and I went with the peeps to check out T Street Roadhouse on Sunday around 8 am.  The dining area was wide open, no waiting.  It&#39;s a very cool atmosphere.  They have these little seating areas that would be good just to hang out for happy hour.  Even the bathrooms were chic.  The bar is really cool.  I love all the glass cabinets that display all the types of liquor they serve.  I also love that they have a counter at the bar, kind of reminds me of an upscale diner.  

The food was amazing.  Hubby had Biscuits and Gravy.  It&#39;s not the typical country gravy.  It&#39;s a creamy jalapeno type of gravy.  It was different in a good way.  The biscuits were flakey and delish.  I had the Denver Frittata.  I don&#39;t dig on eggs all that much, but they did it right.  Lots of fresh veggies and the hashbrowns were crispy and tasted so buttery.  I tried some of the braised short ribs that came in the scramble, it was very good.  In fact, I think I&#39;m going to order that next time.

The bloody mary bar was awesome!  Lots of mix ins to choose from.  I went with &#34;The Works&#34; tomato mix, jalepeno stuffed olives, &amp; celery.  But they had bacon, cheese stuffed olives, carrots, onion, horseradish and other goodies to choose from.  They also have this wonderful garlic sauce sitting at your table.  I added that to my bloody mary also.  I&#39;m telling you, you gotta check these guys out.  They also have bottomless mimosas.  

I think this could be our new hang out place in belmar.  We&#39;ll be back...maybe this week sometime.  Cheers!"

We took a group of friends out for dinner last night and we picked this place since it was new. We&#39;re pretty glad we did! Everyone enjoyed their food and the drinks were great. I had the EOBK which was the burger with bacon, fried egg, hash browns and a glazed donut as the bun.  It pretty good - I think it would have been better if the hamburger patty didn&#39;t have such an overpowering charcoal flavor. To try and offset this million calorie burger I had the Lemon-Parmesan Kale as the side. I am a HUGE fan of the Kale. The husband got the Mac n&#39; Cheese burger that had fried Mac n&#39; Cheese and a chipotle ranch drizzle on a brioche bun.  He loved it!  

When coming to this place, I&#39;d recommend getting a reservation - especially if you&#39;re going to eat during a peak feeding time.  The staff was very friendly and their outfits are very nice - I&#39;d work there just to wear one! We&#39;ll be back!

Thanks to Yelp I found this place and ordered a Caesar salad with steak and bowl of green chile.  When I got there, they told me they had run out of green chile.  Not a big deal but a little disappointing.  The most disappointing thing was the steak on the Caesar salad though.  It was tough and overcooked. Also the salad was literally two wedges of lettuce with dressing drizzled on top.  It seemed odd that they already put the dressing on it when I had ordered the salad to-go.  Typically when you order a salad to-go, the dressing comes on the side.

This place was better than fast food and for that I am thankful, but nothing too amazing."

They have a good beer selection (didn&#39;t look at wine or anything else). 

My husband got the pulled pork sandwich and he finished the whole thing! Finishing a whole sandwich might not seem like a big deal, but when he always come back with 3 bites left in a box, finishing it all is a HUGE deal. Clearly he really enjoyed it.  My friend got the Mac n Cheese burger and as weird as it looked, he couldn&#39;t stop raving about it. The pricing wasn&#39;t very expensive but it was cheap, average for a good lunch.

I live very close by, but don&#39;t happen to go to Belmar that frequently.  Let me just start by saying this is a GREAT addition to Belmar. Super different than the majority of restaurants that are currently there.  The Décor inside is awesome, very modern but still casual. Loved the cool artwork and the unique look of the Bar.  There is a large patio also.

Lots of different cocktails and wines, but we just went with a pitcher of Apricot Blonde.  You wouldn&#39;t think a place like this would have pitchers of beer, pleasant surprise.
We ordered the brussel sprouts, they were delicious and had a kick to them.  Menu you was awesome.. it was honestly hard to choose. They have everything from burgers, pizzas, salads, to more upscale entrees. I had the short rib dinner and my fiancé ordered the bass, both were fantastic. The jalapeño mashed potatoes are spicy and ah.mazing. Our waiter was great and attentive, you could tell they were pretty busy for a Saturday night, but all in all - good service.

However wait staff was mediocre at best. We felt lile we were interrupting and a bother. I don&#39;t think we ordered fast enough. They were out of the beer I wanted. We never got a spoon to eat dessert with and had to eat icecream  with a fork. The apple crisp looked horrible, was ice cold and hard. The foodrunner seemed annoyed that we asked him for anything. I understand it was Thanksgiving and the wait staff probably doesn&#39;t want to be there. However, it seemed pretentious. I was just dissapointed in the service."

I have been here a few times now, and these have been my observations:

- Food is spectacular, especially the sandwiches
- Service could use room for improvement in the realm of promptness
- Location is in a fun urban area, which can culminate for a great half day 
- Once again, I am a big advocate of the food they serve. From the burgers to the salads, it is all superb

Conclusively, T Street promises the best bang for your buck in an eccentric environment that will appease all of your food loving desires!"

The initial reviews seemed positive and the place has looked pretty busy so, thought we&#39;d give it a shot. I&#39;ll get right to the heart of it: this place is just super mediocre. 
Highlights:

-the place looks nice, and the patio has some nice herbage making for a pleasant atmosphere.
- the happy hour beer for 14 oz is 3.50. Not too bad. 
- the service was mistake-free and reasonably fast.

Now for the less positive. 

- despite the tremendous air of hipster superiority the menu is shockingly un-inventive. Two kinds of fish tacos, with little difference but the species of tuna? A few largely conventional burgers (except one with fried mac and cheese, but that little trick is getting really played out to me). Chicken and salads for 14-25 bucks? Why? Food was overpriced in my opinion. 

- this is technically not the restaurants fault, but our waiter was just... corny. He looked and sounded like Peewee Herman. His voice was LOUD and GRATING with inflection better suited for a preschool sing along, and this would be forgivable, if he only didn&#39;t shout STILL DOIN&#39; OK!? At us literally EVERY time he passed our table. It was hokey diner service at upscale prices. I worked in fine dining for years, it&#39;s just not gracious. 

- I had the buddha burger. It had a very fancy description of sweet and spicy, sesame oil, portobello with crispy wonton and aioli. It sounded pretty good. Let me tell you, what arrived was a normal burger with basically, grilled mushrooms and thousand island dressing and a soggy fried wonton wrapper slapped on. I had the side of apple slaw which was limp and actually somehow less flavorful than a sliced raw apple. It was seriously gross, all of it. 

I hope they can improve the menu, but till then, i&#39;m not bothering to come back."

The food was pretty decent and but a bit pricy. However the service is horrible and this place has no concept of customer service. The mangement was rude and the server was busy talking with co workers than actually working. Never got refills and sat there 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. 

Overall decent food but other places in Belmar with better food and prices and most of all service 

I would not return or recommend.  This place won&#39;t last with the staff that is in place now."

My friend and I placed a pickup order. The lady didn&#39;t ask for our name. Second, while taking our order the waitress didn&#39;t know what sides came with the orders. Third, didn&#39;t tell us how much it would cost. 

When we went to go pick up our order, the host directed us to the bar to pick up our food. We stood there and no one asked us why we were there. So my friend asked the bartender if we could pick up our order. Then the bartender told us we had to wait for another person. WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THREE PEOPLE TO GET OUR FOOD. Most of the servers were just standing around. 

We ordered French Toast &amp; the Farm Fresh Breakfast. Would not recommend the French Toast being that it was bland, oily and had no powder sugar. Even worse, after we got our food they didn&#39;t give us any condiments such as maple syrup, jelly or ketchup. My friend went back to get me maple syrup. Mediocre breakfast. 

Working in the restaurant industry, I would expect this place to have a better system especially being there&#39;s over 10 people working the floor. 

Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go back here for breakfast."

Ordered a makers mark on the rocks with a slice of lime. Got 1/2 makers 1/2 lime juice. Said to the waitress that it looks limey and was told the bartender squeezed lime in it. So I strained it into another glass hoping to use some with my other drink and ordered another just rox. Ended up ordering another rox with dinner but the 1st was sooo limey I used only a very few drops. 
The food...
The salmon looked good but since I&#39;m reducing my carbs I asked how sweet was the sauce and should I get it on the side? Was told it&#39;s just a quick wipe so I agreed. Also no potatoes. She offered up a lemon kale but I said just a little more asparagus would work. My friend got some Mexican dish. The food came and not only did I get the lemon kale, the entire dish was in a 1&#34; bath of the sauce! Fortunately the salmon was on top and I was able to save some veggies. Thank god I got some sauce or there would have been no flavor at all. The salmon was ordered medium delivered literally 1/2 well and the other 1/2 rare... I guess the average was medium?
My friend said hers was very tasteless as well. An A for presentation an F for execution.
Bill arrives and I was charged for the 3 makers. Showed the waitress the 1st went untouched and she went to the manager to have it removed. We were sitting on top of the kitchen so she didn&#39;t have to go far. Now I&#39;m not sure if at this point I had just kinda had it or being sensitive but swear the look I got from the manager was not one of admiration...
Hopefully this was a fluke..."

Hannah-who&#39;s-a-palindrome (that&#39;s how she announced herself) was a real delight and right on top of our multi-partied big table in the covered outdoors patio area.

Brussel sprouts...kids, all I can say is if you hate Brussel sprouts you&#39;ve probably only had them boiled.  ANY OTHER WAY, they are amazing - baked, or preferably, pan-fried or broiled.  T Street graces you with a sweet &amp; spicy sesame glaze and goat cheese to complement it...you might be wanting seconds.

Happy hour is indeed happy here; because they serve a wide variety of one of my favorite boozy drinks: mules.  You know, copper mug, ginger beer, lime juice and a sprig of mint or slice of lime - well T Street has 6 of them to choose from.  I had a taste of someone&#39;s blueberry mule which was solidly good (vodka), my 1st one was the peach nectar one with peach vodka which was...stellarly peachy by me...and my 2nd one was the horseshoe mule (presumably because of the &#34;kick&#34; it has) with tequila.  I&#39;m not a lightweight guy, and these things snuck up on me...I thought they were tasty but little alcohol...*buzzzzzz* wrong, I just needed to wait 10-15 minutes...but by the time I left, I was a very happy camper.

The edamame isn&#39;t bad as an app, and the shishito peppers are delectable - basted in a lime juice/sea salt/honey-chipotle molasses glaze.  It&#39;s, uh...it&#39;s got some heat to it.  Takes a while to get there, then you might find yourself coughing.  Nice, pleasant burn afterwards.

Our event organizer gave this place a chance, to replace another establishment we&#39;d had issues getting seating at before and &#34;special requests&#34; being made of our party; I for one would gladly stick here for pre-and-post movie goodness.  So long unworthy other place."

Takes longer to get food? No big deal, A little disorganized? Sure. 

But this failed to meet expectations all around in bigger ways. The food is overpriced - my Thai salad with Ahi was $17. That would be ok if it was outstanding, but it wasn&#39;t. There were 5 pieces of Ahi that were super thin cut. A few tiny pieces of mango. Nothing special at all, though the dressing was good. The flatbread pizza my husband had was pretty good.

My biggest complaint is the bar service. We sat at the bar and despite being a quiet night, it took forever for the bartender to notice us and take orders, get refills, bring the check, etc. My husband ordered a second beer, different type from the first, and she filled it into the same glass - not cool.

The space is really neat, but the food wasn&#39;t great, it was pricey, poor customer service, and not worth returning. We may check back in a few months, but this seemed beyond the bugs you expect in a new place - just not good."

The ambience is upscale, yet comfortable. The menu is appealing, and the service is excellent. At this point, they&#39;ve only been open a few weeks, but we&#39;ve already inserted them into our regular rotation.

The service was really great at the beginning but once the restaurant got about 40% full it was really slow. Our server seemed to be hustling but another server was standing around readjusting napkins on a table for another reservation that hadn&#39;t arrived for about 10 minutes. They could use a little more teamwork there. 

The food was good - nothing special but good. The coffee is really bitter and strong. If that is your coffee preference you&#39;ll be in heaven because they serve it in nice big mugs.. 

The decor is very clean but feels a bit sterile. I wouldn&#39;t recommend the restaurant for kids. They have some toys for the kids which is cool but  it feels like bar with the breakfast service as more of an after thought. I think it would be great for adults looking for a good happy hour or a bite before or after a movie. We&#39;ll definitely go back for date night."

The pork was nice and tender and the BBQ sauce had a smokey, chipotle flavor. The fried onions give it a nice crunch. The kale salad was yummy lemony deliciousness, though one of my dining partners thought it was too lemony, I loved it. One of the friends I was with is gluten free, they have a gluten free menu, my friend had the turkey-peach sandwich and said it was delicious. I took off one star for service which was slow, considering there weren&#39;t many diners in there when we went in, and somewhat snooty. She didn&#39;t smile, didn&#39;t offer suggestions, slow to refill drinks. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Looking forward to going back and super happy to have another decent dining choice in Lakewood."

The design of this restaurant is beautiful. The food was incredible. My wife had a Veggie Frittata and I had the &#34;Hangover Helper&#34; which is an upscale version of biscuits and gravy served withe eggs as you like them, bacon or sausage, jalapeno gravy - very tasty comfort food. The service was great. We are so pleased to have Tstreet as a new neighbor here in Belmar. We understand they will soon be adding an outdoor covered patio seating area on the north side of the restaurant.

After all Belmar has a very low bar established for restaurants and I was hopeful. Well, my expectations were not only met but, exceeded.

The food was horrific. Soggy fish (encumbered by some twisted cinnamon glop, half fried), tasteless coleslaw that was served with browning apple due, I presume to poor prep and hold... a breakfast that had hash browns burned and flipped so the nice side was up, half done sausage and overcooked scrambled eggs. SMUCKER&#39;s Jelly for the toast (like you get in a diner)... This was a new low for even this saddened culinary desert. If you kid yourself into thinking this is &#39;good,&#39; you should probably reconsider having your expectations lowered even further. Perhaps surgically. Don&#39;t bother with this place. The service was really nice and they seemed to actually care but, nothing can compensate for a back of house that is half cooking and overcooking their mistakes."

My family has a wide range of food tastes and there was something for everyone, including the kids. Our service was definitely a 5, the server was helpful and attentive but not &#34;in your face&#34; attentive. The food was very good and it was different. We didn&#39;t think it resembled chain food at all. My only complaint was that my daughter&#39;s burger was not as well cooked as she would like so she sent it back. It was no problem at all and they were accommodating. The problem was that when it came back they had reused the bun, lettuce, etc. A new bun would have been nice because the old one was soggy. If it were not for that, I would have given it a 5.  Nice to have a new place to go to."

The four of us stopped in for a drink and a quick bite to eat. We sat outside since it was such a nice day. Our server was great and didn&#39;t forget about us because we were outside. They have quite a selection of specialty mules. I went for the mule made with tequila- it definitely had a bite and they didn&#39;t skimp on the tequila. One of my sisters had the peach nectar mule and the other sister had the blueberry mule. The Peach Nectar mule was amazing! The blueberry was super fresh and crisp and very blueberry! Will definitely come back to try more of the mules soon! We orders the Cheese dip (so good) - Brussel sprouts (to die for!) and the Ahi Tuna Tacos $4 each and a side of Sweet Potato Waffle Fries $4.

Our waitress was great.  She had our food and drink out quickly.  The menu is well done without being overwhelming.  Their menu has some unique flavors to it without going overboard.  I had the Buddha Burger....YUMMMM.  The ingredients made me skeptical (sweet &amp; spicy sesame/crispy wontons/cucumber strings/mushrooms/voodoo aioli) but the waitress assured me it was delicious.  And it was spot on.  I&#39;d definitely recommend this restaurant.  It&#39;s upscale flare that Belmar needed.

Good atmosphere and plenty of room and tables.  Came here on Mother&#39;s Day and it was a different story.  No hostess to seat us, so we sat ourselves.  We finally got someone to take or order, but the drinks took forever to arrive, and when they did they weren&#39;t even filled up completely.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive, but they definitely need to do some more hiring.  Food was excellent as it was the first time too.  Place will be a go to spot in Belmar if they can get more staff hired quickly.  Also need to have Jamison at the bar."

There was a large group of us (10) so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s complications when preparing the food, so the dishes were brought out at longer intervals than some of us would have liked, but this is just a minor complaint, again there was a lot of us. 

The dish I ordered was delicious (lemon chicken), and on top of that the cocktails were well-made and there&#39;s a good selection of beer. Good HH prices as well.

I sat at the half-empty bar for over 5 minutes with a bartender walking passed multiple times without ever acknowledging my presence until another gentleman finally came up to take my drink order. I asked for a food menu and quickly made a decision then waited for over 25 minutes before anyone even said anything to me. If they were super busy, I would be pretty understanding but the employees were standing around joking and didn&#39;t seem to be in a hurry. I never even ended up ordering food because of the poor service experience. Hopefully this is only because it is a new restaurant (which is why I gave the benefit of the doubt and gave it 2 stars), but it seems unlikely that I will be coming back anytime soon, I would much rather go to any of the other restaurants within a two minute walk.

For appetizers we had the smoked Brie, edamame, peppers and the fondue , all AMAZING!  For entrees we had the marguerita pizza, fire baked perfectly.  The Roadhouse salad was a perfect blend of sweet and salty.  The Mac and cheese burger was a delight!  The pickles mixed well with the gooey cheese and pasta.

First we sat for over 10 minutes with no wait staff coming to great us. Once we ordered drinks it took a long time to receive them. 
After we ordered food the Lemon Chicken was amazing and the Prime Dip was not enjoyed. The meat was very fatty and the bun was a basic bun-not the one advertised on the menu-making it a soggy mess. Eventually the manager took it off our bill which was appreciated. 
Overall we ended up having to go up to the bar ourselves for a wine refill and ask another server to get our beer that had been sitting in the service delivery bar area for over 5 minutes--our server disappeared for over 20 minutes and when he returned he stated he was bringing the garbage out-not what you want to hear from someone delivering your food and drinks. 

As a customer (who has worked in the restaurant business for several years) it was very disappointing on the quality of service and attention brought to our overall experience. If we find ourselves in Belmar again we might try it again but we will not intentionally head that direction. 
Overall would not recommend sadly."

I have gone here 3 times and all 3 times I have had the same experience. We get seated fairly quickly (we&#39;ve made reservations all 3 times) but there&#39;s where the quickness ends. Drinks take forever to come to you, the food takes forever, and it takes forever for the server to come and check on you. We&#39;ve had empty drinks sitting in front of us every time. Our server and others just walked right past us like we weren&#39;t even there. Last night, we ordered the oysters (which we have ordered the two previous times). They were so slow coming out that I had forgotten we ordered them. They also decided to add some micro greens on top of the oysters and little bottles of hot sauce to the platter which makes it look cheap and unappetizing. 3 out of our 10 oysters were broken and had pieces of shell in them. At $3.50 per oyster, you would expect better. They also don&#39;t give you side plates with the oysters for some reason. The servers look lost and unhappy, which could be because they are wearing the most uncomfortable looking uniforms I&#39;ve ever seen. This restaurant seemed like it was going to be our new go-to spot but sadly it won&#39;t be. Hopefully they educate their staff better on customer service and turn the place around."

This Irish pub has some darn good fried fish &amp; chips- I recommend trying it for less than $14! The fish itself was great (2 pieces) &amp; it sat on a huge bed of French fries.

I also tried:

1. BBQ pork sliders: Pulled pork topped with coleslaw on a warm brioche bun - for under $10
2. Cuban panini: Thinly sliced ham, pulled pork, swiss cheese, pickles and spicy mustard served on  a ciabatta bread roll- $11

The panini was my least favorite because it was too carb-y. I was really full off of it after eating just 1/2. The fish &amp; chips was my favorite dish. I think it is their most popular dish. There were 2 piecs of fish on a giant bed of French fries. The sliders were juicy &amp; had some nice acidity &amp; crunch from the pickles.

The potatoes and cabbage were undercooked. I was hungry so I just tried to eat it, but it was pretty bad. I&#39;m not sure how that meal could get so badly butchered, but maybe the cook wasn&#39;t on his game? I&#39;ll probably be back because they do have a good happy hour and other food I&#39;ve had here was better, but I&#39;d suggest staying away from this meal."

The service was great and we loved the vibe of the place although it was a little dark inside. The server loaned us a flashlight to read the menu which needed a new battery, it was very funny. 

We had pretzel bites which came with a beer cheese sauce and a mustard sauce. It was delicious! The two sauces mixed together is the key. We were early enough for the end of happy hour so the beers were $4 each and the app about $7.

One of the things we liked most about the place was that although it was an Irish pub, you can actually hear each other speak!!"

Where else can you roll in the door at 6:25am and grab a coffee, and have your pint of guinness handed to you at exactly 7:00am on the dot, as you&#39;re ready to order the Irish Breakfast and watch Liverpool battle whomever they&#39;re up against. (Go Reds!)

The food is solid, though I&#39;ve only ever had the brunch personally. I&#39;ve had friends (good ones, the ones who&#39;d bail you out of jail at 4am) tell me lunch and dinner are spot on as well, but I can&#39;t comment specifically myself.

I love the atmosphere. Great English pub feel (you know, for us Yanks) with TVs scattered about, and a great patio area that opens up into the dining room so you can see the TVs on match day.

Now, for my two favorite things about this place. 

First, they open to show *every* Liverpool game, regardless of time. They are THE Liverpool bar in Denver, so if you&#39;re an LFC fan, this is your place. The Abbey Tavern has been instrumental in my progression to the type that loves &#34;proper football&#34;. Hockey will always be my first love, and you&#39;ll always find me on the golf course on the weekends, but there&#39;s something about getting up groggy and hungover and disheveled at 6am on a Saturday to venture across town to The Abbey for a &#39;Pool game. It&#39;s a great community and camaraderie, and The Abbey is a great place for it. 

Second, the staff. I&#39;ve had a few soccer-related experiences here, and they range from &#34;There were literally 6 people in the entire bar, including the bartender and the cook&#34; to &#34;I&#39;m glad we got here 45 minutes before the match because we actually, somehow, got the last seats inside the damn building&#34;. I&#39;ve received the same level of quick &amp; super-friendly service in both scenarios. Everyone is friendly and happy and fast as can be. I&#39;ve rarely gone more than 5-6 minutes without a beer in my hand, even when the place is packed to the gills and and everyone is ordering celebratory pints after &#39;Pool sunk a tying goal vs. Man City. 

I think my only gripe is that the TVs are pretty small. Space and aesthetics over the bar are certainly a consideration, though I think that it would be beneficial to increase the sizes a bit for a better viewing experience. Even sitting right at the bar they feel a little undersized. 

Say, when do The Reds play again? I need an Irish breakfast."

Reading over the cocktail menu I felt like a lot of drinks would be good. But let&#39;s get to the reason I came here the food. Reading over the reviews and people giving this place almost 4 stars I was expecting yummy bar food. Knowing I was not going to a super fancy place I felt I went with a open mind and a empty stomach. What a disappointment.  Hardly ever is yelp reviewers this wrong. My son ordered the BBQ burger med but when it came it was raw in side. I ordered fish and chips which looked delicious. It was served with coleslaw french fries and tartar sauce. Nothing had any flavor . The tartar sauce was some of the worst I&#39;ve ever had in any place. Matter fact Long John Silvers has better tartar sauce. But that being said the waitress was nice ... A little slow but nice. And I have a feeling this is more of a drinking place. So skip the food and enjoy one of the many cocktails from the large list of yummy looking drinks :)

From start to finish, our experience here was superb! The fish and chips I had was heavenly and the service was incomparable. Trying to decide what to order for drinks and our meals, our server took the time to sit down with us and go over in-depth everything that we were contemplating ordering and gave us her honest opinion.

I have yet to have hot Irish nachos anywhere though. They were very good, but make sure you like horseradish!  It was very overwhelming. I had the Reuben which was awesome. It came with mashed potatoes which were nothing to write home about. My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad which was pretty bland. 

Our server was very good. She was attentive and kind. The atmosphere was that of a pub and the outdoor seating was excellent on a cool night.

It was a standard, plump, juicy, chicken breast that was married with a delicious Swiss cheese, hugged by a crispy baguette coupled with the potato soup.Yes- the typically hearty, bland sidekick was massaged and dressed as a spicy companion. It gave this sandwich an extra kick that helped it to stand out. I would dribble a little like a sauce or dressing before I take a bite and WoW- a much better choice than chips or fries. 
I complimented the chef and he very nonchalant replays, &#34;oh-yeah, it was one of my specialities in culinary school.  I told the Master Chef, Jay, You did it again, out of simple ingredients, you made another dinning experience great, I asked his secret and without batting an eye he said, &#34;It&#39;s love.&#34;Salud, Jay-"

I have driven by so many times and wondered, &#34;What&#39;s the deal?&#34; After I got the chance to stop in for Happy Hour I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It&#39;s got a lot of spirit and some really excellent food and drink.

The physical space is just awesome. It&#39;s dark and cool inside but there is a bright patio for some outdoor drinking. I like the big windows that open to offer some fresh air. There are spaces to sit, stand, and lean at the bar. It&#39;s a very welcoming atmosphere which is what one would expect from an Irish tavern.

During HH there are great food and drink specials. I had the battered chicken tenders and they were finger lickin&#39; good. I got a glimpse of the Shepard&#39;s Pie and it sure seemed delicious! I&#39;ll have to give it a try on my next stop-in. There is a solid selection of tap beers as well as bottled and canned libations. You also have your booze bottles for mixed drinks - everything you want from a bar.  A little something for everyone.

The employees are so nice it was hard to leave! Over all the experience was great and I would for sure come back. I&#39;m sure during St. Patty&#39;s Day there is great fun to be had. I&#39;ll add it to my list of good times with green things!"

Sat at the bar, ordered a beer and proceeded to watch the couple next to me (very intoxicated) practically have a shouting match in the pub. Now I like a good bar fight as well as the next person (probably more!), but when I&#39;m not on duty I like to relax and enjoy myself. These folks killed the atmosphere of the joint, and worse yet no one from the bar (manager, hello?) came over to tell them to simply keep it down (or shut up!)

When the beer was gone, so was I... Consider yourself warned.

Hubs needed something closer to home, some protein that he might like and to The Abbey Tavern we went.  Right after we enter this establishment, we sat ourselves at one of the Booth Seating near to the Bar on the Left Wing of this establishment.  That evening was on Thursday evening, April 24th 2014.  Time was about 20:30hrs ish.

We waited for abit, until our lovely server came to our table to give us the Menu that evening.  That evening, our server her name is Katy.  Table 2/1.  We ordered the following items :

*  BBQ Chicken Wings ($10.95)
*  Corn Beef Rueben, sandwiches &amp; fries ($10.95)
*  Irish Nachos ($8.95)
*  Coffee and Fountain Coke Cola for Hubs

5 minutes later after ordering, Hubs received his Coffee and Fountain Coke Cola order.  As for me, I opt to have water as my beverages.

About 15 minutes later, our order arrived.  Hubs got his Reuben.  We definitely LIKE the Irish Nachos.  Even when I am writing this review, I kept on thinking about the Irish Nachos.  Man, I wonder what they put on those Nachos, though I cannot deny, the &#34;Potato Chips&#34; that are thinly sliced and FRIED are a little on a &#34;cold&#34; side, to my liking.

Throughout the whole evening, Hubs kept on comparing this Irish Nachos with McCoys.  Sorry McCoys, coz the Irish Nachos from The Abbey Tavern is WAY BETTER tasting than McCoys.  From the Rueben, to the Chicken Wings and the Irish Nachos, Hubs rated everything 3.5 stars

2 stars for the Chicken Wings personally for me, coz its too sweet for my liking.  *SAD FACE*

Our server periodically come and refill Hubs coffee and make sure we have what we need that evening.  All in all decent establishment which is like 20 minutes away from where we live.  We also enjoyed ourselves thoroughly that evening, watching the AVS game on the several TV Screens that they are showing.

3.5 stars at best for OVERALL Experience, dining in, and having our late evening Dinner here.  We don&#39;t mind returning to this establishment coz I am eyeing for another dish for the next visit from the Menu.

Even when she&#39;s slammed (we always have her as our server and I can&#39;t remember her name- sorry!) she&#39;s always really nice. 
The Irish nachos are pretty consistent. Sometimes the sauce is horseradishier than others, hence my always getting extra to make it how I like. I&#39;ve sampled some of the other dishes and have liked them all.

I stopped at The Abbey Tavern last night after being stood up, yet again, but that&#39;s a whole other story. I didn&#39;t really want to just go to the Argonaut and head home alone and be miserable, but I also didn&#39;t want to hangout in a super loud place that would just remind me how alone I felt. I had dressed up and wanted to still give my outfit some exposure. Thankfully, the Abbey ended up being a nice place for me to turn my night around.

I sat at the bar and ordered the Jameson flight. I&#39;ll admit that I liked the plain old Jameson better than the 12, Black, or Gold versions. It might just be because I&#39;m used the the plain version. Allison, the bartender, was friendly and kept busy, and she seemed to get to know the patrons. There was a guy next to me who ended up talking with me about sports, work, and random other things, and when conversation lulled a bit, we could watch SportsCenter. 

I ordered a Jameson on the rocks before calling it a night, and my tab wasn&#39;t too bad. The flight was only $12.

I&#39;ll be back, but hopefully under happier circumstances anyway."

Had the fish tacos, was okay, nothing special and a Crown and Coke short.
Bring a flashlight to read the menu and tab as the lighting is so low you really can&#39;t see printed material.
I&#39;m trying not to be rude but this place has nothing going on, 4 customers on a Saturday night?
That should have been my first clue to exit because no fun was going to be had here!
I get my bill and to my shock, $7.00 for a Crown and Coke?

I reserve 5 stars for truly exceptional experiences with no complaints at all.

I love the patio, and the inside looks pretty nice as well. We didn&#39;t do drinks this time, but I saw Stella draughts and Magner&#39;s on the menu, so for sure next time. 

Our waitress was really efficient and very sweet, it&#39;s just...the food ya&#39;ll! The flatiron, mash, and steamed veg special sounded good. It was, unfortunately over cooked, the mash was covered in anemic gravy, and the snap peas were swimming in some weird sauce. My husband&#39;s bbq bacon cheeseburger was much better. We also tried the jalapeño avocado hummus. It was okay, but devoid of any jalapeño or avocado flavor.

Also, totally not the Abbey&#39;s fault, a table full of loud obnoxious drunks managed to drown out the Colfax noise with their slurred banter, all but ruining the ambiance of the patio."

It seems to tout itself as an Irish style pub, but there are some big differences from the other Irish pubs that I can innumerate:

1.  They don&#39;t close at 10pm (like most Irish pubs in Ireland, if you&#39;ve been there, you know)
2.  The &#39;Irish&#39; bartender (on the nights I have been there) is ACTUALLY Irish, and a good chap.
3.  Clean, tidy establishment.  As in, the bar top wasn&#39;t sticky, the crappers were well maintained, etc.
4.  Great patio area for all of your boozing needs.
5.  A good selection of reasonably priced beers and cocktails.
6.  Just a good general feel to the place.  

Anyhow, I think that their annual marketing budget is $0 dollars, because a simple flyer on my door would have gotten me in there months earlier.  It is literally 4 blocks away, but because it is set back behind (very good) parking, it doesn&#39;t stand out.

Try it out.  I want them to succeed.  Good spot!"

The interior is well-lit and I like the pass-through between the outside patio and the inside seating area.  They have regular seating and also long tables for groups.

It doesn&#39;t appear to be a place to hang out and pound down a few, and there were kids in the place each time I went.  I think that is a good thing!  That means its not a booze swilling establishment full of scum bags.  In other words a nice place where you can have a good time with the family or just with your friends, and not worry about getting a tetanus shot afterwards.

The food is pretty good, I really liked the shephard&#39;s pie and I had a good burger there once too.  They have typical pub fare food and also have a couple of items with Irish spin on them.  The shepard&#39;s pie is heavily Americanized, still delicious, but more like pot roast and potatoes in a bowl.

Thing is, I&#39;m not quite sure what this place is.  Is it an Irish Tavern?  Is it a sports bar?  Is it trying to bring a little LODO vibe to East &#39;fax?  This is what  I mean:  both times I visited the Abbey, I noticed things like the portion size of the meal and the plating.  Its an Irish pub!  I shouldn&#39;t be worried about plating and portion size in an Irish pub!  Also, I shouldn&#39;t have to wonder about getting soup or fries in a place with an Irish theme... that&#39;s just a given in any pub in Ireland.  I didn&#39;t get that feeling in the Abbey.

Also, a few nice big screen TVs, well positioned for watching the game, but not obtrusive to distract from conversation.  Not really a place to watch a lot of games on Sunday, but a good choice to watch the big game when it is on.

Staff was nice and attentive, and I hope the place does well."

It is a very cute little pub but it is kind of hidden behind their parking lot. The bar is very clean but the place was not very crowded around 1:00 on a Saturday. 

Everyone in my group got the Bloody Mary with house-infused pickle vodka. The vodka was a good touch but the bloody could have been a little bit spicier. 

I ordered the breakfast Mac and cheese from their brunch menu which is available until 4 on Saturdays and Sundays. Mac and cheese with bacon and peppers topped with scrambled eggs and ritz crackers. I loved the idea of it but it was sort of lacking in flavor. 

Another person in my group got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. He rated it as an 8/10. The BBQ sauce was homemade and served warm on the side. The bacon was very thick but also crispy. The fries were good and crispy. 

The third member of my group ordered the Blt with avocado. It&#39;s pretty hard to mess up this dish and he said it was pretty standard. 

The appetizers on the menu looked delicious so I will probably come back to have the appetizers."

The building is set back from Colfax which makes for a decent parking lot up front but also easy to miss. The sign is on the building but maybe they need one on the street or just look for Marczyks Fine Food opposite.
Been there twice in two days and sat at the bar both times so not sure how the wait staff are apart from being very friendly. Donny the bartender is a cool dude, very attentive and experienced in the business. He knows how to pour a decent pint of Guinness and theres no corny shamrock on the head. Do they even do that in Ireland? 
Glen one of the owners is from Dublin and used to manage a couple of Irish pubs in town so he knows the business and what he wanted for his own Irish pub. From what I have read, the building used to be a Florists for like 20 years and with its arched windows it has the perfect Abbey look. I love the front door and the theme continues inside. The booths, long tables and the bar are all inviting to sit at. The patio will be a huge draw when the weather gets better, so far only seen it used by smokers!
The menu has a great selection, I ordered the Fish &amp; Chips and while it was good, I guess 8oz isn&#39;t very much so I&#39;ll stick with GB for my fish fix. I did get to try the Shepherds pie which was pretty tasty and looking forward to trying other things on the menu like the Guinness bbq wings, Irish Stew and Abbey Rolls.
So a great neighborhood pub in the making, go and check it out. Ive only been there at night so haven&#39;t experienced any rug rats running amok but don&#39;t pubs have a no kids policy after a certain time? The only negatives I see so far are if smoking is allowed on the patio once the weather warms up and the mens bogs only have one pisser!

The bartenders have asked our names and used them during service, which is a great personal touch. We have yet to make use of the patio, though it&#39;s very large and inviting.

I like the look and feel inside, the bar has plenty of seats, the happy hour is pretty reasonable and even last till seven. Also, the beer list is pretty good. But this place leaves much to be desired if it&#39;s to be called a tavern, rather than a bar.

Went there last night and started with the Irish Nachos. They are delicious, but they were cold. Later, I ordered the Chicken Avocado sandwich. Upon inspection there were just a few paper thin slices of avocado. By this time the food had been dropped off and no one seemed to care if we needed anything or not. I ended up carrying my plate over to a waitress and asked her if she thought this amount of avocado warrants it being called an avocado chicken sandwich. She took it in the back, came back out with more on top, and said the cook did put a quarter of an avocado on the sandwich in the first place. My point here is that a quarter of an avocado is not sufficient when your sandwich is on a baguette. It wasn&#39;t noticeable at all when taking a bite. Also, the chicken seemed pretty low quality and bland, leaving the sandwich overall pretty bland itself. Had to flag down the waitress later to get some mustard to put on my, now cold, sandwich.

tl;dr - Good bar for a happy hour, good beer list, but low quality food at a high price and questionable service (though it was pretty busy for a Monday night, so the service could be better then what I experienced)."

Just like its neighbor down the street, I have a new place to eat or grab a beer after work. 

I&#39;d met with some friends there on one of the first nights of their grand opening so please consider these contributing factors. Ok, so it&#39;s new and the place was slammed, we still managed to find a seat and order a couple of beers with a very minimal wait while we waited for a table and our friends to join us. Although they were new, the staff were very friendly, quick and attentive. In spite of working with a new and fairly extensive and diverse menu, they were knowledgeable and even made some great recommendations. Irish co-owner Glen Eastwood wanted to demonstrate Irish hospitality and his servers reflect this superbly.

All of us being starved and feeling daring (and a little drinky at this point), we decided to really get a feel for the menu and ordered numerous appetizers; salmon potato cake, the humus dip, sliders and the abbey roll. Now like I said, the kitchen is new as were the staff so it actually worked out wonderfully in our favor. The food was all executed perfectly and quickly and brought served surprisingly fast. Everything was hot, fresh and very tasty. I&#39;d likely attribute this to the fact that quality control was on point before any bad habits had set in. I&#39;ll definitely have to revisit in the near future to follow up on this notion.

Sure, I&#39;ve heard it said that the menu was hit and miss but I doubt it is due to execution but you never know. Their offerings are could be considered very non traditional Irish fare so you never know. You can&#39;t please everybody but they made a tremendous effort on  the night we were there and at a very busy time.

I do agree that given the wonderful selection of local brews in the area they could showcase a few more but that&#39;s not their intention and the selection isn&#39;t lousy at all.

I&#39;m even happy to see that they&#39;re kid friendly... even though I myself almost turned and left when I saw the sheer number of little hooligans running about. Eventually the families thinned out and the atmosphere was much more bearable. I gave it some thought; why would they want to alienate a neighborhood full of families? Kudos guys."

Interior is very nice, subtle touches here and there, beautiful back bar, very cool European style ceramic beer towers, arched windows, Irish coins set into the bar counter.

Ordered a Guinness which was poured perfectly [meaning it was black and settled] when it got to the table, my wife just wanted a tiny beer as she&#39;s not a drinker and they obliged by giving her a small &#39;high ball&#39; size glass of cider.

Server was friendly and surprisingly knowledgeable considering how new the place is.
Irish nachos were warm and generously covered in the listed ingredients.
Seafood pasta entree was tasty  .....but a little on the small side for my big ass appetite...
Salmon entree was cooked perfectly..... I should know...I finished my wife&#39;s...

Their happy hour is good, although I think not including Guinness on HH is a bit of a bush league move but not overly terrible. I do wish their local draft selection was a bit better than the Breckenridge types but their import draft selection is great. The appetizers are a bit hit and miss but mostly good, and I&#39;d be interested to try the fish and chips and brunch menu. 

Basically, this place is just getting their feet wet and learning as they go. I&#39;ve heard that the food menu will evolve, and I think the seating will get better once people can sit outside when the weather is nicer at night.

I was almost reluctant to I try the Abbey but I was pleased. Cozy and comfortable environment.  As I pulled up to the bar,  the bartender introduced himself and proceeded to call me by my name for the rest of the evening. Was not feeling like Irish food so I ordered a wedge salad and shrimp tacos. A sizable fresh lettuce wedge came out with several blue cheese crumbles inside and outside of the dressing.  The bacon bits were large pieces of crisp and sweet bacon that perfectly complimented the salty blue cheese. The Abbey makes a great wedge salad. The shrimp tacos were flavorful with cabbage and a creamy zesty dressing. Both dishes were simple but few do it as well as the Abbey. Well done Abbey! I&#39;ll be back soon."

The atmosphere was low-key and most of the people sitting around the bar area seemed to be young professionals and couples. The booths and tables appeared to be full of families with kids.

Service wasn&#39;t incredibly fast, nor was it slow. The draft beer selection was fantastic, and the specials were good too. I ordered an avocado chicken sandwich that was great because it was very simple and not overloaded with tons of unhealthy, greasy extras.

The patio will probably be pretty awesome when warmer weather rolls around. There&#39;s some parking, but if it gains in popularity, street parking may be more realistic.

I liked the overall vibe, and as a nearby resident will be returning. That said, I&#39;m hoping they limit hours when kids are allowed there to avoid any potential confrontations between the younger crowd and parents."

Being last minute on a sunday and getting into Downtown Abbey with no TV of my own, I called them up to see if they would host, which they were happy to do. They set us up with our own tv around the corner of the bar, great aps and pints, nice decor, totally awesome staff didn&#39;t have a problem with us ordering 10 till kitchen close. Will probably do this again next week."

I was excited to finally see the Abbey Tavern open, and my wife and I headed down as soon as we could. They were pretty full for an early dinner on Saturday night - a good sign. And we were really happy to see a lot of families there as well - not just a bunch of grumpy DINKs talking about how the Audi R8 is so overrated and &#34;oh, you absolutely *must* visit Costa Rica in February. It&#39;s delightful!&#34;

The food is above average, and you&#39;ll get the standard Irish options - beef stew, full breakfast, shepherd&#39;s pie - plus some salads, burgers, etc. I had the Fish &amp; Chips and found them OK (though it&#39;s hard to beat GB for fish &amp; chips in Colorado). My wife had a burger and was a little less impressed. All in all, the options are decent, but I&#39;m looking forward to the food getting better as the kitchen hits its stride. 

The beer selection is where The Abbey Tavern definitely shines. With 10 beers on tap, and a large variety of bottle/can selections as well, you&#39;re bound to find something you like. Though you really should just go for a proper Guinness pint, like a gentleman.

There are, of course, a few kinks that probably need to be worked out. With only ~8 tables, seating feels somewhat sparse given the spaciousness of this pub, and &#34;seat yourself&#34; means you&#39;re going to have to hustle if you want to sit anywhere other than the bar.

Parking was also a challenge, but one could chalk that up to the popularity of this great new neighborhood pub. A bike rack or two outside would also be a welcome addition.

The bottom line: decent food, great beer, and a lively neighborhood atmosphere. We&#39;ll definitely be headed back."

Beer selection is alright, nothing to brag about, but the happy hour specials are great. One complaint and it is what sends us to other bars a lot of nights instead of the Abbey. The food is only OK (maybe not even that good). The burgers are fine and irish nachos are good, but the rest of the menu needs help.

The interior layout is an open plan, with large tables similar to a European style tavern. Everything is new and nice, so don&#39;t come here expecting privacy for a relaxing dinner and beer. We shared a large table with another group of people. That&#39;s fine, not the end of the world. 

Being an Irish restaurant, we of course had to order the Fish &amp; Chips and the Shepard&#39;s Pie and shared both of them. I love eating fish and chips, and have ordered it all over town. This was the most laughable order of fish I&#39;ve ever seen for $11. Two wimpy pieces of fried fish, a small handful of soggy fries, and 2 spoonfuls of coleslaw. I seriously sat there and laughed for about 3 minutes wondering if the rest of my order was going to show up. It didn&#39;t. I ate it, and ended up going home and raiding my refrigerator to fill my friday night stomach. 

The Shepard&#39;s Pie was ok at best. After several shakes from the salt shaker, I finally found some flavor. Nothing special. 

I had high hopes for this place, and was disappointed. It wasn&#39;t awful, but nothing special either....but do have high expectations for good Shepard&#39;s Pie and Fish and Chips from an Irish restaurant, and my expectations were not met

With that said, there is another Irish pub on this side of town I will go to instead when I have my Irish cravings. But if I&#39;m looking for a beer and a cool place to enjoy it, then I might return"

My favorite was the latke. They can call it a potato pancake, but to me it is the way hash browns are supposed to be served (which I rarely find): shredded and fried to crispy golden brown perfection. 

It&#39;s great that they are expanding into a bigger space next door! I just hope they keep focusing on the high quality and good service that makes it a 5-star joint in the first place."

The food:
I ordered the LOX Benny. It can with strawberries, blueberries, and sliced tomatoes on the side. At first I wished I had ordered potatoes with it, but the dish comes on large bagels with tons of toppings and yummy stuff so the fruit was definitely a good call.

The service:
It is a very small place, but somehow they managed to accommodate everyone and served with a smile. We had 3 different people help us and all were incredibly friendly and helpful with any questions we had about the menu.

The space:
As I said, it is a very small space. There are around 5 small tables inside and 2 larger tables outside. We opted for the communal seating outside, and it was perfect weather.  Even though the place is small, it&#39;s almost part of the charm. They also are building a new, larger space right next door. I&#39;m sure they can use it, because there were people standing on the street waiting.

Love this place! :)"

We gave it a try, glad we did.

Be warned,that the interior of Maddie&#39;s is small, 6 small tables, and 2 high tops. I&#39;m estimating that 16 people can sit inside, which would be a tight fit. There isn&#39;t lots of room to move around, and if someone is going to take a seat in the seat behind you, the person sitting down will probably bump your chair. So, just know the interior is small.There is seating outside on the front patio, but this only holds several small tables as well.  

The menu is small, but the food is good.

I had my usual of bacon and eggs, over easy, and toast. The bacon was very good, which is hard to find these days. The eggs were cooked as requested, not too runny, cooked just right. The toast was good as well. The potatoes were a potato latka, which I choose the one with bacon and cheese.  Not too much bacon (can&#39;t believe I said that), and not too much cheese too. I enjoyed the potatoe latka.

The coffee is (I believe) Peet&#39;s Coffee, very good coffee.

Service is very good, nothing to improve on here.

The only negative I can say is the place is small on the inside, and parties over 2 people are going to have a hard time sitting inside. Several larger groups (while we were there), decided to pass, as they couldn&#39;t be accommodated. This was hard to see, as the food is worth it.  I really do hope that Maddie&#39;s has room to grow and expand, as the food is very good. I know they would not regret it, as business would boom even more! What do you think Maddie&#39;s?"

For starters: No biscuits and gravy on the menu. No rye toast. 

The business is very small, with a handful of tables, eight to be exact. Due to the holiday season it was packed full on a Wednesday morning before 9am. The meal was served quick. 

I tried the customer favorite, &#34;What Came First?,&#34; with the house made chicken schnitzel, country gravy, two eggs, potatoes and wheat toast. 

The meal was hot. The hearty portion of potatoes had red peppers and onions and took up half the plate. I did not eat them all. The country gravy was interesting, unlike anything I have ever had. Beef based? Seemed odd tasting. I am not a big fan of schnitzel. The chicken schnitzel was OK, sort of dry, but the gravy made it taste weird. There was a spoonful of gravy. 

The coffee was dark and strong and good.

Overall a quaint dining experience with quick service and friendly staff. Their menu didn&#39;t really do anything for me. I will probably never return unfortunately.

Outside there&#39;s two red communal tables. There you can have a big party sit together comfortably. 

Maddie&#39;s make up for the lack of square footage by serving down home awesome food. I had the challah French toast with a side of bacon. Topped with fresh fruits. This was really good! 

The main reason we showed up today was their Bottomless Mimosa $12. Stiff and it comes in Pineapple, Grapefruit, O.J and Cranberry flavors. I tried them all. My favorite so far is the pineapple flavored mimi:)

Awesome staff. Their sticky buns are given free. Sorta like a free starter. They&#39;re cute and tiny all three were gone in no time!

Quaint. 

We ordered coffee right away which we regretted, it was super strong. When we saw the table tent with morning drink specials we wished we had ordered one. Next time we are getting the Mimosa&#39;s or the Coffee with Bourbon and Whipped Cream.  

I ordered the Traditional Benedict, it came with ham and gouda. I also had the home fries with it. Delicious. Creamy, savory, really delicious. The home fries have delicious bits of red onion and red peppers, so good!

My sister ordered the Bacon and Cheese Colorado Cakes.  They were good but so very greasy and the potatoes were overdone.  Think it would be much better if they combined the veggie cake and the bacon and cheese one.  Something else needs to be in there to absorb the grease. It was good, just greasy.  She had to order additional cream cheese to tone it down and they charged her $1 for a dollup. We did not like that either. 

I would recommend the &#39;Benny&#39;s&#39; but probably not the Colorado cakes.  Next time we are going to try the Frittata and the pancakes.  Can&#39;t wait to bring my husband here too.

Wife got the breakfast burrito which was much better portion wise, but lacked any finesse and was pretty much diner food plopped on a plate. 

Bottomless mimosas...90% juice and our server was so busy that refills were slow coming. I only got 3 between sitting down and chatting for about 10 minutes after plates were cleared. Finally had to give up on my brunch buzz, especially since people were pacing outside of the patio while they were waiting for a table. 

Overall, a huge disappointment and waste of money. Sorry, we won&#39;t be back."

I was really impressed with the poached eggs at Maddie&#39;s! I love cutting open the egg and seeing the yolk spill over. The Benny comes with potatoes that were also delicious! My boyfriend&#39;s burrito was huge! We had to take it to go! The burrito comes with fresh fruit, which is a great side to the filling burrito.

Are you kidding me?  I&#39;ll be back one more time to try it out because the food is so good, but breakfast is not supposed to take over 45 minutes from the time you sit down until the time you get food.  The food is 5 star all the way and the waitress did the best she could do given the circumstance, but I&#39;m giving the restaurant 1 star only because it took so long to get service/food that I wouldn&#39;t be coming back to give it second chance if I didn&#39;t like the food.  Next time if they can&#39;t prove they can staff the restaurant properly, I won&#39;t be coming back.


***UPDATE***  I went back and had a different waitress on a Sunday morning again.  I went much earlier to avoid a crowd and only 3 tables were sat inside.  We sat outside and the waitress said she would be right with us.  After 10 minutes she came out to stop a gentleman from walking inside because he had coffee from another establishment and apparently that is against rules.  After talking a bit they went inside and he placed a to go order.  Just as we were about to get up and leave the waitress comes out and drops off water.  We asked to place out order and she said she needed something to write the order down because apparently 2 people is too much to remember.  3-5 minutes later She returns and takes our order and from then on the service was fine.  

We waited a total of 20-25 minutes before we were able to place our order when there were only 3 tables.  The gentleman who placed his to-go order 10 minutes after we sat down received his food about 5 minutes later while we still waited for out food

In addition, the waitress was quite quick and seemed slightly irritated.  The only reason she received a tip at all is because my wife forced me.  I always tip a minimum of about 20% and have only never left a tip 3 times ever.  For reference we eat out about 6 times a week on average.  

Good pancakes once again but unless they are giving me free food for the craptastic service I have received in the past, I will not be going back which is a shame since I live within a 5 minute walk and like the food."

On first glance you notice this place is super small. A couple of outside tables and a few more on the inside. It seemed like there was one woman working front of house too. My suggestion: if you&#39;re in a hurry, pick somewhere else. Good food takes time and with a limited staff it&#39;s easy to see this place could get bogged down. 
I got the blueberry pancakes and bacon. Wow. The pancakes were heaven. Soft and fluffy with crispy edges and a little hint of some sort of citrus zest. I think orange. They were worth the drive from Colorado Springs. They also came with I&#39;m  guessing home made whipped cream. There were flecks of vanilla in the whipped cream so I&#39;m assuming it was homemade. Every part of it was delicious but for me, the pancakes, syrup and whipped cream were a bit too sweet. I&#39;ll just have the pancakes and syrup next time. 
The bacon was good, but I don&#39;t like wimpy bacon. So I&#39;ll just get something different next time because it&#39;s not my preference.

My fiancée and I usually find ourselves here Sunday for brunch. Sure to never disappoint, we always return for the amazing bloody Mary&#39;s (best in denver) and delicious food! My absolute favorite is either their chicken sandwich or the Middle East wrap, as my taste buds are usually geared to lunch. My fiancée will usually get the &#34;what comes first&#34; which is excellent if your looking for a substantial and yummy meal. 
The only downfall is the size of the place, during the summer you can utilize their outdoor community tables but I foresee the winter months being a bit of a wait--- still,  all worth the wait! Enjoy!"

Wife and I were looking for a new brunch spot nearby and stumbled upon Maddie&#39;s on Yelp. Checked it out and can&#39;t believe we didn&#39;t know about it. Really cozy space, friendly service, and food that hits the spot for a reasonable price. We ordered the Benny &amp; Lox, a salmon benedict dish, and the Colorado Cakes - latkas!!! Gayor (rhyme&#39;s with bear) came out and chatted with us for a bit - a humble and easy-going restauranteur who cares about his guests. This gem of an eatery will quickly become a staple within the Denver morning eats scene. Check it out for sure!!!"

One thing that was abundantly clear right off the bat was the size!  There are about 8 tables, not including 2 larger &#39;community&#39; tables out front.  Luckily, we arrived early-ish, before the throngs of weekend brunch goers descended on this little gem of a restaurant.  While we waited, the servers/hostesses were incredible!  They brought us drinks, and attended to us, despite the fact that we were still waiting.  

Once we were inside, the great service continued.  

I ordered the breakfast sandwich; my friend, the frittata.  Maddie&#39;s is gluten-free friendly, which was a big deal for my friend, who has serious allergies to gluten.  Our breakfasts were absolutely delicious, and left me hungry for more (well...I was full when I left, but savored the taste for the next time I would return!).  I highly recommend Maddies, and look forward to returning!"

Outstanding, house made blueberry pancakes (other options available) served with housemade vanilla bean whipped cream and choice of bacon or sausage (I had crispy bacon and it was gooood).

Well, there are 8 tables and a couple of barstools at the counter. So they can serve about 16 people inside. They also have two large community style picnic tables on the patio to use during nicer weather. If you get there during peak brunch hours like we did, expect a 15-20 minute wait. But don&#39;t worry, the wait is absolutely worthwhile!

Maybe it&#39;s because Maddie&#39;s is so small that they are serving up some of the best breakfast food I&#39;ve had in Denver lately. The menu has a wide selection, there&#39;s something for everyone. Personally, I was drawn to the Lox and Bagel Benedict-two of my favorite breakfast items rolled into one! I ordered that with coffee to drink and my friend ordered the Bacon and Cheese frittata and a side of pancakes. 

My Benedict was fantastic: perfectly poached eggs on top of a toasted bagel with a light smear of cream cheese, spring mix, red onion and fresh nova lox.  The Hollandaise sauce was thin and light, not thick and gloppy, and the perfect combination of butter and lemon. My coffee was good too, they serve Peet&#39;s which I love, so no complaints there.  My friend said her frittata and potatoes were outstanding and her pancake was one of the best she&#39;s had: crispy outside, light and fluffy inside.

The one issue with Maddie&#39;s being so small is it&#39;s not really a place where diners can linger for a bit to drink their coffee and chat after their meal. At least on a Saturday or Sunday. There&#39;s always a few parties waiting for a table. But that&#39;s a minor issue and it certainly won&#39;t stop me from returning.

I am so glad to have this gem in my neighborhood. Maddie&#39;s is definitely as good as it gets!"

We went at 10:15, thinking there would be a wait, but were seated in less than 5 minutes. The servers here are awesome - they hustle their tails off. When you order bottomless breakfast cocktails, you can mix and match (Bellini, Mimosa, or Bloody) - which is an awesome deal, in my book. And, like I alluded to, the second you are close to making that slurpy-empty-sound with your straw, the servers are there to offer you more/ another.  The menu is well-rounded and what we ordered (breakfast quesadilla, mini cinnamon rolls, and the chicken schnitzel) was tasty.  We will be back. Thanks, Maddie&#39;s!"

The waitress brought out a small snack plate for my little one to snack on while waiting for our breakfast. I thought that was so sweet and thoughtful! I&#39;ve never had a restaurant think to do that. I was impressed. I ordered the turkey sausage breakfast quesadilla, soooo yummy. I ordered the cinnamon pancakes with bacon for my little one and let me tell you, those pancakes and their famous vanilla bean whipped cream were absolutely scrumptious.

Not to mention, our dog&#39;s name is Maddie. So, that&#39;s cool.

We cruised over on our bikes, parked them outside, and grabbed a spot at one of the patio tables. Service was fast and friendly. Coffee was good, water was cold, juice was fresh tasting. 

Hubster got the chicken sandwich, and he said it was clean and amazing and fresh tasting. I got the Israeli breakfast, which was exactly what I needed: a dab of protein, some veggies and hummous. There were potatoes and challah too, but I didn&#39;t really eat much of that (just because I was trying to avoid over carbing it.)

The clientele was mixed and fun, local. The prices were reasonable. Two meals, two beverages, plus tip, $30 out the door.

Plenty of obvious regulars in the main area, sports of all sorts on their many tvs. I asked the bartender what spiced rum they had, Captain Morgan of course, but offered up a dark spiced rum I&#39;ve never heard of which was pretty good. I ordered the Swiss and mushroom burger which was just greasy enough for good bar food. I kinda wanted a little more mushrooms but it was still tasty. My boyfriend got the fried mushrooms and onion rings which were perfect.
The people there were really nice. The bartender, Carla, was super chill and great attitude. The regulars were friendly and welcoming, recommending which daya/times to go there based on what kind of atmosphere you wanted. Favorite thing was the darkness of the second bar with the pool tables, and the free pool. Only downside was there were a few shady people hanging around outside, but I expect that at most bars.

When we entered the bar, we didn&#39;t know at first if we needed to wait to be greeted or just seat ourselves. After about a minute we decided to seat ourselves amongst the other Steelers fans. It took over 6 minutes to be acknowledged by anybody working. 

We ordered Dry Dock&#39;s Hop Abomination and our beers came overflowing and made a mess on our table. We know the head chef so we knew the food would be good. Well, I didn&#39;t really care for the cheese used for the chili cheese fries because it all stuck together in giant chunks. But overall they were good.

My favorite part is that the venue is split...when you walk in, you can either go to the left to the bar and seating area, or go around the corner to the pool tables. Once when we went, there was a loud karaoke night going on on the entry side of the bar, and it was packed. We went to the other side of the bar to play pool, and it was like being in a different bar! We couldn&#39;t even hear the loud obnoxious drunks singing songs that shouldn&#39;t have been written in the first place. :) 

The prices are good too...we always get a pitcher when we go and split it amongst our friends, and we end up not paying an arm and a leg to drink. 

Oh, and they do have free pool! Not all the time, but something like after 11...a lot of pro players seem to come in to practice for free. They are fun to watch, seeing as how I couldn&#39;t hit a ball if I was aiming for it with a telephone pole."

Best things about Pitchers:  Free Pool on weeknights, good prices pitchers of beer, usually very friendly and attentive bar staff. And they don&#39;t allow Raiders gear, which is good.   I&#39;ve only eaten here one time and got a chicken fried steak. It was pretty good though!

What you get with Pitchers is basically the epitome of Aurora neighborhood/dive bars along Chambers Road, etc.  A lot of different people in there, gets pretty busy on the weekend nights and is totally a dive.. kind of dingy, lots of neon signs, ugly carpet, worn down tables and furnishings, ugly light fixtures/ceiling fans.  Its all part of the atmosphere.

Go here when: you live close and you&#39;re looking for a local spot to grab some beers, shoot some pool, or check out the crowd."

Saturday morning, looking for a place to have lunch and beers of course. This place was in walking distance from our hotel in Downtown. Upon walking in the bartender greeted us and offered a booth, or offered us to sit at the bar with him. We opted for the bar since there was only three of us and I am so glad we did. We all started with local, draft brews and recommendations from the bartender. 

For food, I started with a side salad that had this AMAZING dressing on top (little spicy balsamic). Then we had the pretzel bites which came with the mustard and the cheese dipping sauce and those were great. Both the sauces were flavorful! And then there are the entrees... We were definitely not disappointed here! I got the Pulled Pork Hoagey- it was loaded with slaw and pulled pork on a soft bun. There were a few peppers adding just a little kick. My brother got the bowl of the Beef Stew and it was packed with meat, potatoes and veggies (&#34;One the of the most delicious &amp; heartiest soups I&#39;ve had!&#34;). And finally, the hubby got the Ruben (AKA Bar 2.0) with the spudpuppies- the bartender described these as a hush puppy &amp; mashed potatoes ran into each other and created this little piece of heaven. Hubby was blown away by how great the bread and the sauce were. All portions were rather large, so come hungry! 

After around round, the bartender gave us more recommendations for brews and food in the Downtown area. I am so glad we stopped in because this place was top notch- great food, awesome beer and phenomenal service! I would come back time and time again!"

There were plenty of interesting beers both on tap and on the can/bottle list. They had Pliny on tap, as well as La Cumbre Elevated (great IPA). 

Their food options are also not bad. I vaguely remember having some ramen one night that had a great broth and their steak frites and bahn mi dishes were good. 

There&#39;s a patio along the sidewalk,which was good for people watching.

If you like beer and good food and don&#39;t mind dropping a few bucks, I&#39;d recommend going to Freshcraft."

The place is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. There are plenty of seats inside. The small tables outside are also great during a sunny afternoon.

The offer a great happy hour if you can get here by 7pm.  $5 beers if it&#39;s served in a pint (or else it&#39;s just the normal price).  This typically leads to something with a punch like the Odell Mercenary.  Ah, thank you, I&#39;ll take another.  

You can get lost in fairly massive and impressive beer selection.  You can also get lost in how much they charge for some of them.  Often they have rare tappings like Pliny The Younger, or one of Avery&#39;s previous years releases.  

Moving on to food, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a reason to complain about anything.  I&#39;ve tried nearly everything on the menu and I keep coming back to the burger, the wings, and the french onion soup.  This isn&#39;t your typical Campbell&#39;s soup in a can, this is an experience.  After working through an inch of cheese, you&#39;ll find a hearty broth with onions that will make you wish the bowl was bigger.  You hear that Freshcraft?? THE BOWLS SHOULD BE BIGGER     

You&#39;ll definitely find that Freshcraft has the feel of a neighborhood brewery but nestled in the busy part of downtown.  It makes finding a parking spot tricky, but the food that much better knowing you fought for it.  Job well done boys on creating a must go to spot in Denver."

Located in an old building in LoDo, the space is narrow but extends deep towards the back. There&#39;s plenty of seating at tables near the bar and at booths in the back. It&#39;s dimly lit, with strings of lights hanging above.

Our friendly server approached immediately and made suggestions for beer and menu choices. We shared the pretzel bites with mustard and cheese to start, which were a bit dry. I ordered the pretzel turkey baja sandwich, which was good but was overloaded with mustard. The pretzel bun itself was very dense and difficult to bite through, so I resorted to taking the top bun off and eating open faced. The cole slaw served is made with a vinegar-based dressing instead of mayo and has a unique and pleasant flavor, but was dry. The other entrees ordered at our table also fell short of expectation. 

Overall, Freshcraft was a nice experience when it comes to ambiance and service, but the food was mediocre at best."

We were seated after a 5 minute wait in a cozy booth. My first choice of beer was unavailable, but the runner up, a German hefeweizen, was not a disappointment. The sounds of raucous conversation permeated the bar, but after a few drinks I&#39;m sure the noise will drown out. We stayed for one round of drinks and did not try the food. What was most memorable about this bar was the cocktail menu. Literally almost every drink was inspired by an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie or based around Mr. Olympia&#39;s persona.

My server had never seen one before but ran it through with no problem. Decor is lots of wood and a bit dark with a dive bar/steakhouse feel but I loved it, even as I dined solo!

Plenty of beers to have and as I was getting a steak salad, there&#39;s actually a lunch special where you chose from a menu item and get a 2$ beer! Not a bad deal if you want to save your Yelp check in offer for later. Great place to grab a sit down lunch with friends, co workers, or even by yourself.

As for the steak salad, I asked for medium and it came out well done but honestly I didn&#39;t really care too much. My steak was just a bit tougher than I was used to but I wasn&#39;t expecting a steakhouse steak.  Salad had cubes of cheddar cheese, long pieces of red onion, lettuce, and I think brioche croutons; nice touch with the croutons.

Then finally someone came over to let us know our waitress is really busy so she will take our orders. 

We ordered the cheese dippers, chicken wings, and burger. The cheese dippers are very similar to mozzarella sticks but were three different cheeses (cheddar, mozzarella and pepperjack) but to me, they were ok. I would have rather had regular mozzarella sticks. The wings had lots of flavor and I enjoyed them. Hubby said his burger was just &#34;ok&#34; because it lacked flavor.

We were a party of 3 at 8pm on a Friday. We were told a 45 minute wait, but it only ended up being about 25 minutes. My friend got the steak frites, cooked rare, and he raved about them. He totally was a member of the Clean Plate Club. I started off with a small bowl of their french onion soup - the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. It&#39;s made with veal stock, and was so incredibly rich and flavorful. Then I had a pulled pork sandwich, the roll was fresh and the pork was tender! I didn&#39;t like the cole slaw it came with, too vinegary. And they ain&#39;t just about beer, the craft cocktails are awesome too.

Where she had her own water and snacks. It was so great!

Our server was great. We really enjoyed her. Despite being very busy inside and outside as well, she was prompt and in all ways very helpful.
We both had Tea, one iced and one hot. Even though this place is known for all it has to offer in the beer dept. Neither of us drink beer.
The food was excellent! Pretzel Bites to start with a cheese Beer sauce on the side! Wonderful! I love French Onion soup, but declined as it was made with a Veal Broth.I just can&#39;t do it. But, it looked lovely. I hope they redo that recipe without the Veal.
Julie got the Steak Salad,she loved it. I got the Salmon BLT minus the bacon. Our server was so sweet, she had the chef put the bacon in a container for the Dog.The Salmon was a huge piece cooked to perfection. Loved it!

I spoke to the manager to tell her my restrictions. When the waiter asked the manager what he should do, she said flippantly, &#34;nothing they probably just want free food now&#34;. 

Aside from the rude staff up to management level the food was as uninspiring as the outside suggests. It&#39;s empty at lunch time which says a lot about an establishment in LoDo.

One thing that was odd was the place smelled strongly like nail polish remover when we walked in, once we got passed the bar area it smelled better.

Our waitress (I thiiiiink her name was Eva) was outstanding! Her pace and friendliness was perfect throughout the meal. 

They had an awesome lunch special going on. I ordered a salmon BLT pita which sounded extremely weird but turned out to be extremely good! My guy ordered the steak wrap.

We shared the bacon turkey small plate, which left a lot to be desired. The cheese was not melted and the sandwich was a bit dry. We also shared the pork schnitzel, which we ended up fighting over since neither of us was impressed by the sandwich.

Now to the food.. Get the chili chicken wings extra crispy. Soooo good! I normally don&#39;t eat chicken wings because most places don&#39;t cook them enough and the skin is soggy, which completely grosses me out, but freshcraft cooked them perfectly! Pretzel bites with honey mustard and fried pickles are also a home run. For a main course the pork schnitzel is perfectly executed.

The ambiance of the place is a little more divey than I would like for a daytime meal, but it was only one of few places open on a Sunday morning in Denver (what is with that btw?). 

We mainly wanted a small snack and some brunchtime beverages so I ordered the green chili and split an order of fried pickles with one friend. The green chili was actually really delicious and tasted homemade. The fried pickles were OK but not my favorite. Nice big pile of em though. My other friends got the pretzel nibs and ale cheese soup respectively. The pretzel nibs were ok, not great, and didn&#39;t taste house-made. The ale cheese soup was ok as well.

I would say this is probably a better place to grab a pint after work rather than have a meal, but I&#39;m ok with that!"

I had a beer. The bartender didn&#39;t seem impressed with my draft selection, but nothing on the board was jumping out at me. A lot of IPAs which I just wasn&#39;t in the mood for at lunch. 

But the food made this a 4 star review. I had the pretzel bites and a cub of French onion soup. The beer cheese sauce you can get with the pretzel bites KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF! I could have partaken in a bowl full of it! SO SO GOOD. The french onion soup was also hearty and divine. 

I left the bar full and happy. Tried not to sleep at my desk the rest of the afternoon."

To start, the place just had a great vibe. Folks at the bar seemed happy, and there was lots of good banter. In terms of the beverage selection, they had an awesome variety of Colorado craft beers as well as a full selection of cocktails and whiskey. 

To get the full experience, I started with a tasty sour beer and ended out with a whiskey flight. If you like sampling whiskeys, I highly recommend the whiskey flight, as you get four samples of anything you want for around $10-15, and they have some really nice whiskeys. I love rye whiskeys, and they had some great choices. They even had a bunch of 12 year, single malt Japanese whiskeys which are hard to find. My server, Jeff, was super friendly and knowledgeable. I very much appreciated that he really knew his stuff about the beer and whiskey selection. He provided excellent service and even helped me find a life saving outlet, as I had killed my phone Yelping (oops!) so I could Lyft home. To sum it up, I had a great time and look forward to coming back and trying other stuff."

Fast forward 12 hours... all the symptoms of food poisoning. I was miserable. My friend, who ordered the same thing, was also violently ill. In retrospect, stew is one of those things that gets held at the wrong temperature. Never again."

Sat down at a very sparsely populated bar, and waited. And waited. If I didn&#39;t have a bunch of time to waste that particular day, I might have been more annoyed. At any rate, I finally got a menu, ordered the burger special, etc.

The food was fantastic. I have never been disappointed in any of the meals I have had in Denver, and that might not even be because of my adeptness in choosing good restaurants. My sample size is small, but I really feel like Denver might be a pretty good city, food-wise.

It doesn&#39;t seem like a kid-friendly place in the back. Just FYI. 

The food looked excellent online and honestly, none of it was very good. It was very mediocre and tasted like typical bar food. 

We had:

Lamb ribs - tasty, but nothing special. 
The pretzels - everyone raves about them online, but they were stale and not soft at all. 
Wings - these were the most tasty out of everything we ordered. Well worth it. 
Duck Ramen - it wasn&#39;t anything special. It lacked flavor and the noodles tasted like the .50 ramen you can buy at a grocery store.

Although I didn&#39;t particularly like the taste of the tacos (too much cumin flavor for my preference), everything else was excellent. Pickles are all homemade, and were the best fried ones I&#39;ve ever had. Tipped it off with the key lime dessert...not overwhelmed with processes lime taste. Perfectly light with berries.

Will make it back here again within the week and will also ask for Nick. 

Final update....we made it back here 3 more times for the fried pickles and steak salad!!!!"

The place was a &#34;shotgun shack&#34; formation with the bar up front and seating in the back.  We were there with our daughter so we had to sit in the back.  I was a little worried that we would miss out on the updated beer list, which was on a chalkboard above the bar.  When something good just gets tapped, I want to get that! And they had a chalkboard in the back that they kept updated.  Yay!

No kids menu but the small plates were perfect for our little toddler.  You don&#39;t have to have an adventurous eater either.  There were lots of things that are unique but the pretzel bites, fries, and spudpuppies, among other things, would satisfy the most picky eater, I think.  My daughter liked the food.

I did get a little too adventurous with my entree selection. I got the PB PB and Jam, which stands for Peanut Butter, Pork Belly and, you guessed it, Jam!  I think it would be better if it was made with actual pork belly, but mine had pork belly bacon, at best.  I like sweet and savory combined, but this was much more sweet than savory.  Best to stick to the less &#34;creative&#34; options.

They were very accommodating with my little one, had high chairs/boosters and there was a diaper changing table in the women&#39;s restroom, although it is one stall so you gotta hurry because drunk people gotta pee!  And, yes, there were a lot of drunk people here on a Sunday night around 5pm.  I&#39;m talking falling down drunk.  Probably because of the recent Broncos game.  But just be aware of that if you want to bring children here.  I found it kid friendly, at least around the hours that families should be out and about.  After midnight, probably not."

The atmosphere is hip but comfortable and the place feels experienced; I mean that in the best way. Freshcraft feels the way Denver *should* feel. 

Despite really solid food, it&#39;s the servers that shine. They all seem to know the menu so well and can confidently make suggestions and know the menu front to back. This is what I want in a restaurant.

The pork loin wrap was quite tasty and not overly heavy while my coworker could not finish his B.A.R. Reuben, and gave me a bite. Wholly moley, that thing is awesome.  I want that above any other reuben ever.  I mean ever...

Also, their version of the Kentucky Mule was also very good, regardless of giving up my ID so I didn&#39;t walk away with the very cool stainless steel mug.  Lucy (not with an i.e.) dealt with our smartassedness with ease as we enjoyed the early Saturday evening.  I would definitely go back to try the crafts on tap when I&#39;m back in Denver."

It seems like a locals divey kind of bar but also has a ton of booths to sit at and a back room full of tables. Long and narrow setting. I was on my own when I arrived on Tuesday night and decided to wander around town and find a tasty brew. No problem when in Denver! I took a seat at the bar and had a great conversation with the friendly bartender.

They offer an extensive list of quality craft beers in draught, and also cans and bottles. Two neon screens above the bar lists the terrific craft beer selection on tap of about 30 choices that rotates. I was in awe. So much beer, so little time. 

As I was hungry I munched down on the whiskey BBQ chicken sandwhich. A solid choice when drinking a quality brew.

Along with the amazing beer I drank I was serenaded by the sweet sounds of 80&#39;s metal such as old Metallica, Def Leppard, Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy and more. I wholeheartedly approve of the music selection here!"

It took us about 10-15 minutes for a waiter to come by and even get our waters, but after that it was smooth sailing.  We got the pretzel bites, which are good but only come with maybe 12 very small bites.  Considering it was only $6, it wasn&#39;t the end of the world.  The beer selection was fantastic, they probably had 50+ craft beers available.  The entrees were great.  You can get any of their salads as wraps and add proteins, so I got the Asian Wrap and added chicken, which was great.  I know some places skimp on the wrap size when you opt out of the salad, but this was a huge wrap and was delicious!  My friends got a burger (she loved it) and the steak frites (again, loved it).  It was a great experience overall."

We got wings to start then each got side salads and split a burger for dinner - the wings were amazing (crispy and tangy with a perfect amount of spice) and the burger was above average...plenty of food to split without overindulging.

Even though happy hour ended at 7, the bartender still honored it at 7:05 when we walked in and had to wait awhile for the table.

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt with everything.  The beer is constantly changing, often unique, and there is plenty of it.  The bartenders have yet to miss on a suggestion for a new one to try: they ask for a few ideas on what you like to drink, a couple names, and then BAM a great new beer.

The food is killer: tasty, a bit unique, and filling.  They certainly seem to concentrate on carbs for soaking up the beer, but I&#39;m into that, so it works out well.  I have never left here hungry and am often a bit too full as it is tough to say &#34;I&#39;m done&#34; with delicious food, especially after a few drinks.

Basically, I love this place.  It is my go-to for dinner and drinks before an Avs game, and I will continue to be back!"

I ordered two cocktails, the Smoking Gun and the... Bullfighter, I think? The Smoking Gun was mezcal-based. It was fine, but I wouldn&#39;t order it again. The Bullfighter was a Scotch-based drink, which I was super excited for. However, the scotch wasn&#39;t good, the juice was way too overwhelming, and I couldn&#39;t taste the smoked ice cube at all. Pass! (I noticed I&#39;m not the first person to complain about the Scotch-- steer clear, in cocktails or on the rocks.) 

However.... Denver, and this place specifically, are really more of a beer-culture. So maybe I shot myself in the foot ordering cocktails in the first place. 

We sat down at 6:30, put in our food and drink orders at the same time, and waited. The drinks came out eventually, but getting a second round was a trick, since the waiter only came back once. I was the only one who was ready at that point, so my friends never got to try another drink.

It was Saturday night, so we were being patient... but at some point around 7:30, we realized our apps were Never coming. We finally found the waiter to ask about them. He came back with the pretzel bites, apologizing and saying he had to yell at the kitchen. We thought that meant the pickles and cheese bites were right behind? He came back later to check on us. When we asked about the other apps, he had NO idea what we were talking about. We put in all the food and drinks together, how was this so hard?! He insisted the pickles and cheese only take a minute, so we ordered them (STARVING). They did eventually come... they were good, but then again, I could have eaten like, an old shoe with some aioli at that point and been happy. 

We initially planned to start with apps and order dinner later, but after the 90 minute ordeal to get one round of drinks and three apps, we nixed that idea. We asked for the bill when he came out with the apps. Next time he came out, he forgot the bill again. I finally just gave him my card and asked him to run it, lest he NEVER return. Unfortunately, even though we put in our app orders during happy hour, we got charged full price because he forgot to ring them in two hours earlier. Ugh. 

Overall: it was a super cute place. Maybe, maybe I would go back for a beer, if I had a while to spend in the city? But if you&#39;re visiting Denver for a short time, don&#39;t spend two hours just waiting around here for one drink and an apps-- not worth it :("

Had the fried pickles, yummy, and the herb crusted fried cheese because cheese. Quite delicious, if I do say so. My friends said their entrees were mediocre, but my sister loves this place so she was happy!

First off I threw a surprise party here (Thanks Denver Yelpers for this awesome reco).  They were solid reserved but I begged and pleaded.  The kind woman on the phone said she would get with what I assumed to be the manager to see what they could do and call me back tomorrow.  They actually called back the next day.  OMG a place that does what they say they will do!  And they worked our party in for a reservation for 10.  Epic.

The beer selection was great and the cocktails were outstanding.  I wish like hell I could tell you the name of the drink I ordered, but just look at my picture, show it to your waitress/bartender and say &#34;that one&#34; and then send me a compliment that says &#34;Damn girl, you were right, this shit is off the chain.&#34;

I haven&#39;t had a chance to catch up to their food truck yet, but I did see it parked in the back. 
It&#39;s probably the smallest restaurant I&#39;ve ever been inside of, but we were the only customers when we first got there so we were able to quickly grab one of their 5 tables without an issue.  The tables were all clean, but when I grabbed on of the condiment jars it was sticky...I really hated that as I was mainly eating with my hands. 
Anyway, this place has some great Honduran food. My fiance and I had the baleadas and the chicharron pupusas and they were perfectly, magically delicious. We did have to wait a very, very long time seeing as when we arrived and ordered we were the only customers in sight. We ordered 2 pepsis and did not receive them until the food came out. It was hot outside, and we were thirsty, but we waited patiently for 30-40 minutes (no joke).We could see the woman making our pupusas in the kitchen, so i&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what the hold up was. I can&#39;t see that as a make ahead item. 
There were a few people that came in while we were waiting and had their food within 10 minutes. I didn&#39;t check out their plate, but I&#39;m assuming there were no pupusas being had. 
Anyway, if you want some great, cheap, authentic Honduran food, this is definitely the place to get it. I feel very comfortable saying that, as my fiance is first generation Honduran American, and spent A LOT of time in Honduras when he was growing up. 
If it wasn&#39;t so far from where we live, we&#39;d probably eat there weekly!"

I am always searching for a good soul food restaurant and this one is not it. Do NOT waste your time or money (extremely over priced) on this place. The food is iconsistent, as I did visit this restaurant on multiple occasions, and limited.  The menu could use some work, as could the wait staff and ambiance. When you walk in, there is no clear place as to where you should go to we either eat or place an order to go. The staff does not know what&#39;s on the menu or the prices! 
If you want good soul food go to Kirk&#39;s on Colfax and 225, or the Hog Heaven red bus on Mississippi and Havana! This place simply isn&#39;t it! I am from the south and know all about good soul food, so if you are expecting authentic sold food, unfortunately this place is not going to fulfill that craving."

They offer a good variety of american fare priced fairly reasonably. The &#34;Perfect&#34; salad with salmon and an orange balsamic was delicious! Plenty of almonds and raisins to give the salad a sweet and nutty flavor too. Staff was super friendly as well. I will certainly be going back, probably to catch one of those epic Colorado sunsets."

Went with my 2 kids, husband, plane loving father-in-law and mother-in-law. At 10:45 am we had to wait 20 minutes for a window seat. Previous tips from Yelp said they weren&#39;t kid friendly and had no highchairs so we&#39;ve been hesitant to try it out, but others have always said it&#39;s a great place for kids. They do indeed have NO highchairs or booster seats which does give the impression of not wanting kids there. But, the waitress assured me besides that they are very kid friendly. So, unless you want to try and eat with a squirming 1-year old on your lap, bring your own seat!
Great view of the planes and runway...which was fun for my 3- year old to watch. Three people ordered the Colorado Burrito and said it was FILLED with a TON of chicken and very filling. I ordered the steak breakfast tacos. The waitress assured me they were big and filling and she was NOT lying. I even had to take one of the Three home! SO much steak and eggs and potatoes with guacamole, Pico de gallo, cojita cheese and a yummy sauce. They were flavorful and meaty! Plus I chose the fruit bowl side which came with pineapple, blueberries, melon, watermelon, strawberries, and oranges! 
They do not have a kids menu but they will make chicken fingers, macaroni and cheese, and a few other things I can&#39;t remember, or they can make smaller portions of pancakes or French toast. It was $8.99 but a large portion that my guy will be eating for days to come! The piano was great to listen to and the baby enjoyed watching him play!
Overall, we had a good experience. If they offered a place for the little ones to sit we would&#39;ve had an even better experience as I wasn&#39;t able to fully enjoy my meal while it was hot."

Lunchtime can get pretty crowded here, and I believe they take reservations, but it really is a nice place! Prompt service and nice staff. Our server was Samantha and she was excellent. We watched planes of all sizes take off and land and could tell who the training flights were. :-)

I heard that the clam chowder was good so we started off with a cup each and I was blown away by its thick deliciousness and freshness and creaminess and I almost passed out with pleasure it was that good. The oyster crackers were perfect accompaniment. 

Hubby had fish &amp; chips and they were perfectly cooked!! He opted for skinny fries over the wedges and it was a great call as they were incredible. Nicely seasoned too! While the fish were not made in traditional British style, the several pieces were perfectly cooked and flaky and juicy on the inside, crunchy and not greasy on the outside. The tartar sauce was pretty incredible as well. 

I ordered the Perfect salad with grilled salmon and it had pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and dried cranberries with a raspberry vinaigrette that blew my socks off! A slice of garlic cheese bread accompanied my salad and I was delightfully impressed with everything! Nom nom nom. 

It was literally a taste explosion in my mouth. The salmon was perfect!! I was full halfway through my meal, but HAD to finish it because I didn&#39;t want to stop eating. Sigh, I had to go back to work without socks. LOL"

Special shout out to their Bloody Mary with pickled okra, green bean, pickle and chilli, and the Santa Fe burger which is loaded with avocado, crispy bacon and chipotle aoili.

We went to Perfect Landing on a day date.  It was a unique atmosphere - surrounded by tables of service men in the Air Force who had met their families for lunch, old friends reunited, families, and travelers all watching the planes land and take off.  We started with a glass of wine to pair with our oysters.  The oysters were good (not great), but our sever, Jared,  was more than accommodating offering extra horseradish, cocktail sauce and crackers that were almost as good alone.  I do love a good horseradish. 
Then we had a lobster roll and a black and blue burger.  The burger managed to beat the roll in my book, though both had some highlights. The lobster had more celery than I prefer, but was tasty.  The roll was a classic split top with just the right out amount of butter and toast. The burger was ordered medium and slightly overdone, but still juicy and tasty. We also had skinny house fries and chips and paired both with their house made bbq that has a cherry flavored kick I quite enjoyed.

Fusing a memorable view of the airstrip with live music and classic dishes done well has made me very fond of dining here. From breakfast to dinner there are great treats to be had for reasonable prices.

You may walk in to find a view of military aircraft sitting just outside and the pilots having a meal. You might witness someone with a small prop plane helping his dog into the passenger seat as the super sleek jet next to him fires up the engines. Sometimes it&#39;s 20 people around the piano cheerfully singing standards. You never really know and that&#39;s the fun of it. 

I can vouch for several things on the menu but there are plenty of choices.
Chicken Fried Steak-One of the best I&#39;ve had.
Scallop Risotto- also has Crab mixed in and very satisfying.
Lobster Roll- What a deal for $16 and with the Steak Fries It&#39;s my favorite thing to get.

Earlier review:
We went here for a Saturday brunch around 11:30am and ordered chicken fried steak and Cali eggs bene. Service was effective but not friendly. Very unsmiling and unresponsive to my friendly and happy disposition.

Aside from that the food was so so. My steak was really well cooked but the meat inside the breading was not seasoned at all. I salted the crunchy coating but it didn&#39;t really help. Better bites occurred when I rubbed the meat into a little salt and pepper on my plate. I was sad about that because the cooking of the CFstreak was so great it would have been delicious. My potatoes were a solid mass of potato. Not &#34;skillet style&#34; potatoes as is seen in the older pics on yelp. I asked the server who brought the food, thinking I ordered the wrong kind, and they asked the chef- who said no, this is the only kind of potatoes they have. Sucks because it was a significant reason I picked this place. 

My eggs were flavorless and mostly inedible even after I added salt and pepper. 

I ordered a biscuit on the side and it was rather dense and also pretty flavorless. It was so dense and flavorless I couldn&#39;t eat it and it was removed from the bill. Gravy was ordered on the side and just bland. Harmless and not good or bad.

My bf ordered eggs bene and liked it. He also said it lacked salt and seasoning though. Mind you we do not normally add salt to our food when we done out. He said his potatoes needed salt and were bland too. He chose the fruit cup and it was the nicest one he&#39;s received he said. Had berries and melon and did look nice.

Lastly the coffee was weak and watery. Big no no for breakfast. The server said they had latte but no espresso machine. Not sure what sort of latte is made without espresso?? 

Overall, I was disappointed and I would not go back here again. The main reason is that even though the food was assembled nicely and cooked fairly well--the seasoning was totally missing from everything and simply adding salt and pepper wasn&#39;t adequate when deeper layers of the food were so lackluster. It&#39;s sad, because I was hoping to find an alternative to the hour-long waits at Snooze."

The two stars are strictly for the ambiance and views.  First, the most disappointing dining experience I have had in many years.  At first glance of the menu, I was thrilled to see a &#34;Lobster roll on a Portuguese roll&#34;.  However...what arrived on my plate was a plain white bread hot dog bun. In addition, I had asked simply for light on the butter if they butter the bread.  Our waiter placed the plate in front of me and said &#34;he put the mayo on the side.  I think he misunderstood what I told him.  Luis is an awesome guy so I didn&#39;t want to correct him.&#34;  Ummmm I&#39;m a pretty awesome guy too...maybe my order should trump in this situation? SO WEIRD!!  So I got a dry hotdog bun (no butter) with dry lobster inside.  Adding to the disappointment was the very lackluster and seemingly annoyed waitstaff and hostesses.  Until they make some changes, I find it impossible to recommend."

Perfect landing has to get a perfect rating...I mean they have perfect in the name!!!  Just kidding, kinda!  They get 5 stars for way more than the name so in unconventional fashion I&#39;m going to bullet point all the positives because there are almost too many to list.

*location-nestled into the heart of the centennial airport you will enjoy your dinner, lunch, or drinks while watching all the different private planes take off and taxi right up to the window, with the beautiful Rockies in the background!

*ambiance- dim lighting makes for a more upscale feel and you will be blown away by the richness of the bar right when you walk in!  People are smiling, laughing and even singing...

*BOOGIE BOB!-  I can&#39;t tell you how much I love listening to live music while enjoying great company, but I&#39;ll try!  Boogie Bob plays very often (not sure of his schedule, that&#39;d be creepy) and he can play it all!  My favorite is when someone asks him to play a certain song and he goes into playing it immediately!  I&#39;ve never heard &#34;oh I don&#39;t know that one&#34;!  

*Food/wine-  the food is very reasonably priced based on quality, even though we have watched the prices go up over the years!  The seafood is top notch, the steaks are perfect and the apps are killer!  My favs are Crab cakes (best I&#39;ve had in Denver!), Jim&#39;s steak and shrimp, where else can you get fine dining sirloin, shrimp and two sides for $15?!  And the wine, how does $25 for your first bottle sound then $ .52 for your second?  You are reading that right!  52 CENTS people!  And it&#39;s good wine!!!

*loyalty program-  get the loyalty card and after 10 visits you get a free lunch entree here.  After 15 it&#39;s a free DINNER entree!  No restrictions!  I just enjoyed a $34 prime ribeye on the bone with my last loyalty reward!  

I love this place as you can tell!  You will too!  You&#39;re welcome, for sharing the best kept secret in Centennial!"

Ambience was OK... but view at night time by the window was beautiful.  Clam chowder was probably the worst I&#39;ve ever had at any restaurant... clams were chewy... almost as if the soup was a day old.  I think even Panera Bread makes better clam chowder than them.  The 30 day aged sirloin was cooked a perfect medium but just did not have the full flavor that I would expect at the price they were charging.  Funny how it was cooked medium but looked totally burnt when it was served which might have been why it tasted a bit dry at first.  Haricot verts was pretty good and the scalloped potatoes were OK.  I think I enjoyed my glass of Stella more than my dinner.  Service was not bad but not great either.  Overall, overpriced for mediocre food... I really wanted to like this place since the theme is super cute and the view is amazing, but food was just not worth the price tag."

Atmosphere consisted mostly of elderly people and a disproportionate number of men.  90/10%.  Come on ladies, get with it.  My BFF and I shared a crab cake appetizer, clam chowder, she had the Reuben (which had a generous portion of poor quality meat ) and I had the salmon salad , which had a generous portion of fresh salmon cooked perfectly.  We shared a bottle of Kendall Jackson wine which was $28.  They offer a small wine selection which is buy one bottle get one bottle for a dollar, but none of the names of the wines sounded familiar.   Aeronautical memorabilia on the walls and in the showcases around the entire restaurant. Tons of planes on the tarmac with a view of the runway in the distance.  A window seat is a must, otherwise it&#39;s just lunch....
Our waitress was attentive and made good recommendations, (she actually told us to avoid the taco salad... Thanks !).  Our food was served at appropriate temperature and there was not excessive noise.   I&#39;ve got to go with my husband when Boogie Bob is there, I hear he&#39;s quite a piano player!   I think they have improved since reading some of these negative Yelp reviews. I had no complaints."

The atmostphere was 5 stars, great FBO, nice view of the runway etc.

I went to The Perfect landing with my friend, we both ordered a burger with French fries. When the food arrived to our table their was a long piece of grey hair, aprox. 5-6&#34; long draped around my burger and fries... It is clear that someone on the kitchen was not wearing a hair net. That is absolutely disgusting...when asking the waiter about the hair strand he mentions that he didn&#39;t see it. When both my friend and another waitress saw the hair strand. We asked the server for a manager and he said that one was coming and a manager never came to our table as I was completely disgusted and lost my appetite after finding this hair strand. It&#39;s a shame that I was charged full price for a grossed out meal at The Perfect Landing."

We visited the first time for Father&#39;s Day and the second time a few weeks later.  Both times the restaurant was packed (reservations required) and both times the food was extraordinary.

Perfect Landing is a bit of a contradiction.  It is located inside a private charter terminal on the top floor, has little to no exterior charm, but inside boasts a large sitting bar, panoramic views of the mountains and of the Centennial Airport landing strip, and white table linens.  

Perfect Landing was recommended to us by friends who said that everything on the breakfast menu was excellent.  Our expectations were high.  And, they were met both times.  A couple of nods go to the biscuits and gravy, the scrambled eggs (finally, a place that appreciates the art of cooking an egg) the banana foster&#39;s pancakes and the poppy seed and carrot cake muffins.  The bacon is thick cut and apple smoked but we have had issues with the consistency - one time it was soggy and the other time it was black.  The service has always been excellent and they were kind enough to put up with 3 children the last go-around."

Back at that time (2009), it was more of a dive bar/restaurant with those round wooden chairs, which is quite different from its current state. It&#39;s still our favorite place for breakfast, and a wonderful spot to bring visitors. 

I can only comment on breakfast items, but meals are always delicious and prices are fair. Their biscuits are a must-try, as they&#39;re the butteriest treats I&#39;ve ever had. I usually have the greek omelet and am always pleased. I would love to see an offering of non-pork side items, though appreciate seafood being available.

The view here is beautiful and can easily keep all members of your party entertained. It&#39;s not a 5 star review as we usually have some sort of encounter, be it a snappy hostess about not having a reservation (ALWAYS make one no matter your party size/date/time), a slow or absent server, or the decision to put a family with small, screaming children beside us.

Poor choice of restaurant for Father&#39;s Day, that&#39;s for sure.
Service was fine, Bloody Marys were good, food was extremely average (if not below) and very overpriced. I ordered the king crab legs which were $35 and came with 4 small crab legs.

I had been wanting to come here for years, but had never gotten around to it.  I pre-browsed the menu and was fairly certain I was going to get a burger.  However, after seeing the size of the club sandwiches, that is what I decided to go with.  It was a very nice club sandwich and I am sure some people could have made two meals from it.  The pile of kettle chips in the middle was the ideal side for this sammich.  My plain old iced tea tasted just fine, and the waitress did a good job of keeping the small glass refilled.  As most people mention, the view of watching planes take off is rather interesting.  There was even a helicopter on the tarmac on this particular day.  We sat at a nice round table with a white table cloth. Service was good, with a couple minor hiccups for others in the group.

It is a bit a walk from the parking area to the restaurant.  But, airport parking (even at smaller ones) is always a pain.  The food being enjoyed by my companions all looked good, and I would gladly come back again sometime."

The food is quite good, I had the prime rib au jus and my boyfriend had the cheeseburger. I enjoyed my sandwich, the meat was flavorful and tender, and they give you large portions.

This restaurant is located in the Centennial Airport and overlooks the runway. Perhaps its the location, but the prices for their breakfast items are more expensive than the food quality/taste/presentation would command. They have a decent selection of standard breakfast fare, and they also serve (and perhaps are better known for) dinner. Both pancakes were fluffy and tasty; portion sizes are fair. The service was friendly.

Overall the restaurant isn&#39;t bad, its just not worth the prices for breakfast. Dinning room is dated and a little mismatched, but there is a stocked bar and a piano.

Probably the biggest draw to this place is the potential to see a football celebrity. Oh, and the food is good...but not without opportunity. 

A large group if us started with apps. Virginia beach style crab cakes were outstanding: all lump crab meat with very little breading. Served with a unique tarter that had some whole grain mustard in it. Also had the bacon crab bacon artichoke dip. Couldn&#39;t get enough of this stuff. 

Majority of the group had steaks or salmon. The crab stuffed salmon looked exceptional. 

I had the night&#39;s special. &#34;Prime&#34; New York steak served with cheddar scalloped potatoes veg. The dish was a big let down on several levels. There was no respect for the &#34;prime&#34; if in fact it was prime. There was a thick layer of fat surrounding the entire steak that had to be dealt with on very bite.    Steaks Need to be trimmed. It was so encrusted with peppercorns that the beef flavor never came through. Also, never ever cut my prime steak into little slices for me! We are adults and can cut out own damn steak. This lets the entire steak get cold very quickly. Two others at the table noted the same dissatisfaction having also ordered the special. 

I have nothing but positive things to say about the service. Extremely courteous and attentive. The bar puts out some great cocktails. 

If I go back, I&#39;ll be checking out that salmon."
the-perfect-landing-centennial,Christina P.,sR0tS-kXYh96UKuAuvOYmA,"Aurora, CO",0,1,1,231,2,pa5A4AKcVZUFDhxnRiixRQ,3.0,2015-05-06,"I went here with my very large family (only 20 people this time around) for lunch to celebrate a family member&#39;s achievement. The location of the restaurant was a little confusing as you had to turn into the Centennial Airport to get to it. It was also on the second floor of what seemed like a check-in area. 

Once you get inside the restaurant, it was very nice. The view was great. We were seated at 2 tables against the window, so we were able to see the runway and planes coming and going. The restaurant was well named.

One of the reasons I docked the restaurant a star was because we were sitting at 2 different tables as 1 large party. While normally I can understand splitting up a group because tables aren&#39;t large enough, they told us that if we wanted to split the check we would have to sit with the people who would be on our same check. This would&#39;ve been incredibly inconvenient as the adults wanted to sit with each other and I wanted to sit with my cousins. We ended up scrapping the idea of split checks because my dad didn&#39;t want to deal with the headache and offer to pay for everyone. In hindsight, I should&#39;ve just stayed at my seat and had my dad order my plate for me. 

I ended up ordering the Lobster Roll Benedict and my sister ordered the Crab and Bacon Mac N&#39; Cheese. My egg was cooked perfectly, the hollandaise was rich and my pieces of lobster were huge. My sister&#39;s mac was really good too. The cheese sauce was super rich and there was definitely no shortage of bacon or crab. 

One of my cousins ordered a chicken finger entree (kid&#39;s portion) and he couldn&#39;t even finish it. Mostly because the chicken seemed over cooked. It was a little dry and became chewy. The seasoning in the breading was pretty good, but the dish definitely could&#39;ve benefitted from less time in the fryer.

I really liked this place overall. While the restaurant has the capacity for a big group, unless you intend to pay for your entire party, I wouldn&#39;t suggest coming here with one. I&#39;ll probably come back with a smaller group next time. The food is pretty good and I wouldn&#39;t pass up another opportunity to eat here."

I am surprised by my fellow Yelpers who have rated this restaurant highly, as usually my reviews align with theirs.  I don&#39;t want to be *that* person who writes a very negative review, but I feel it is warranted.  

We arrived around 5:00 pm and asked to sit in the bar (nearly empty).  Our hostess did not provide us menus, nor did she alert anyone to our presence.  We sat there for five minutes without so much as a &#34;hi, be with you shortly.&#34;  Our server finally stopped by and asked what we wanted to drink.  I politely asked for menus.  Several minutes later, he brought one wine list, no menu.  It took several more minutes for him to bring ONE menu.  There were two of us.  I went back to the front and got my own.  

The highlight of the evening was the gentleman who was playing the piano.  He got tipped more than our server did, sadly, as he was the one who at least made it tolerable.  I kept waiting for the experience to get better, thinking positively.  Unfortunately it got worse.  

The food is mediocre, at best.  We had clam chowder, which was lacking in depth of flavor.  I had fish and chips.  It was nearly flavorless.  I had to add a lot of salt, vinegar and lemon to make it taste like something.  My husband had a filet and shrimp.  The filet was cut for him, and it looked very dry.  Our server did not check on us a SINGLE time after he brought our food.  My wine and water glasses were empty.  I had to finally flag him down toward the end of the meal to get more water.  He acted very put out.  We then waited 15 minutes after we finished eating for him to come back so we could ask for the check.  I am a kind and patient diner.  But this place was not at all busy.  He simply disappeared.  I finally caught his attention, again, politely, and he snapped at me, &#34;Just a minute.&#34;  Oooohhhh-kay.  I cannot remember a time we were treated with such apathy and disregard.  

I looked around for a manager to let him/her know the experience we were having, but there was none to be found.  It was clear to me that not one person there took pride in the food, service, or dining experience."

Go for Happy Hour, its the best deals on food and drink.
I was here with a few friends, but this is a restaurant that has an older clientele, so don&#39;t expect hip and trendy. Either way its worth it for the food, the views, and the fact they have a piano and a piano player."

The food is always top notch. Service is excellent! Even when my ex is doing his best to annoy ( his way of being friendly) staff is always ready for him and never seems to get tired of it even when busy. That say&#39;s a lot about being a great bartender, server, hostess. 

I usually have the salmon or one of the seafood pastas. The pastas are always very good, with a nice bit of spicy bite to them! Something a lot of places that specialize in them never manage. 

The deserts... well I have yet to have one that is not excuse the cliché but &#34; to die for&#34;! 

The crowd seems to be a pretty friendly bunch. Seems like a nice mix of age groups most of the time.

Boogie Bob does a great job on piano! Even my granddaughter was &#34; swaying&#34; to the music!

Sean does a great job of mixing all of these attributes into a nice place to go for any meal.

Oh, the view certainly doesn&#39;t hurt!"

I thought my son would love it. I made a reservation and we had to wait a few minutes for a table. When I made the reservation I requested a table by the window but didn&#39;t get one. They were too busy. They also don&#39;t have high chairs or booster seats which was weird. 
We got to the table and it took our waiter about ten minutes to come and greet us. He apologized so it was ok at that point. 
His name was Danny and he was very pleasant but almost too pleasant like in a fake way. Once again it took like ten minutes to get bread and water. My dad got his soul before we got our wine. I got my glass first then my husband got his literally ten minutes later. The calamari came out and it was tender but had no flavor. I asked for more bread but did not get it til about half way after my dinner was done. 
Anyway the main entrées took about 45 minutes. My dads steak was super rare. I was looking for Danny to complain and to get another glass of wine but he was no where in site. About 15 minutes later he came up with bread and apologized for it being late. My dad being the nice guy he is didn&#39;t wanna complain due to the fact that it might have taken an hour to get another steak. I finished my sea scallops  which were pretty decent and then my wine arrived. 
We asked for a box and once again about another 10 minutes later then he arrived with one and not offer us a dessert menu. Many minutes later he came back and just dropped the check off and then after placing it on the table he said oh yeah do you guys want dessert. I told him no because it would take way too long he said he was sorry and the next time you came in he would bias crème brûlée. 
Yeah there won&#39;t be a next time. Danny needs to figure out how to be a waiter he was absolutely awful and it took so long to get every single item you ordered."

The first time we went was for breakfast. The waitress said she&#39;d been there for 15 years I think, she was fantastic!  Beautiful views, delicious food! 

The next time we went.... Ugh. Basically we hurried up so we could leave. We were unfortunately seated next to a group of individuals who&#39;d convened to apparently discuss their dermatological conditions (gag!!).  It was a fairly empty dining room, it would&#39;ve been nice to have some space between us and the mole people. 

Thankfully they left when our main courses arrived. ...just in time for the waitress to start vacuuming our side of the restaurant while another sat close by folding silverware. We jetted out of there quickly after before we became truly irritated. 

The unfortunate experience was around 3:30pm, so just maybe don&#39;t go there at that time of the day?"

Yes, the view is great, and it&#39;s a unique dining experience. And yes, it is nice to find yourself with your DTC UYE lunch group dining over a nice tablecloth with a nice table setting. But, my steak salad was so boring!

The salad was good size, though not large enough that I was able to make it to dinner without a snack. The meat on it was cooked as I asked, but lacked any real flavor. The crispy onion straws were about the only thing that brought any real flavor besides the tiny sprinkling of blue cheese. The dressing was so mild I barely tasted it; I know it was there because I saw its tell-tale oily residue across the lettuce, but just barely. It wasn&#39;t a bad salad, it was just an expensive salad that did not hold up it&#39;s end of the bargain on the &#34;you-get-what-you-pay-for&#34; spectrum.

Service was good. Our waitress was pretty attentive and was nice about breaking up our checks individually. The average age of diners was definitely older than your typical DTC crowd. It is quiet and upscale enough, it would make for a great lunch meeting spot.

All in all, I&#39;ll come back to this place but only if I&#39;m not paying"

I ordered the seafood pie. The crust itself was delicious, and the sauce was creamy and herby. However, half of the seafood in the pie was nearly inedible. The shrimp was rubbery, as though it had been boiled, then cooked again in the pie. The scallops seemed to suffer the same fate. The white fish and lobster chunks were fine, texture-wise, if a bit on the scant side by their inclusion.

I&#39;m glad they offer St Germain, because my vodka martini helped to smooth out the meal.

I won&#39;t be going out of my way to return. There are better restaurants with better seafood. A pity, since I would hope this place could fly their stuff in daily."

We arrived at the resturant and it took our server a half an hour for him to come back and take our drink order. We then waited another half an hour for our food, at which point had to send the order back because the the food was overcooked. By the time I got my order I was full from bread and had to take the rest home. This time I waited only 10 minutes before I took the iniative in getting my own to go box. What a great birthday.

1. The ambiance, it&#39;s not the best. The interior is kind of old and outdated and isn&#39;t that easy on the eyes. This isn&#39;t why you are at the restaurant... you are there to watch planes take off and land! 

2. The staff. Our waiter was cool, but he seemed like he was pretty rushed. They were starting to pick up for dinner and we were asking him for suggestions. He gave recommendations, but he didn&#39;t find out what were were looking for to make those recommendations. It was pretty much the top two most expensive things on the menu. 

3. The food. I had the bison burger. it was good! Juicy, cooked just like I asked for it to be. My wife, I forgot what she had, but she ate it all! So no complaints in this area. 

4. This is the place where a lot of mature adults hang out. I think we were the youngest couple there by about 30 years. Does this change anything? Absolutely not! Just take it as an FYI, nothing more, nothing less. 

5. Either get their early or make reservations, that is the only way you will get a seat next to the window. 

All that being said, would this be my first choice to go out to eat again? Probably not, however, I would definitely go back, make reservations, and get a window seat. This may change my review from three stars to four stars...

So we went back on a Friday eve for their happy hour. Short version - great but it is an older crowd well suited to their piano bar scene. $40 for 2 grey goose, several ales, a dozen oysters and one crab appetizer - nice. And though packed at 5 when we seated ourselves at the last 2 seats at the bar, we had very good, friendly service. 

The view is amazing, food and drink and service and our fellow bar patrons were great fun. 

Highly recommend. I don&#39;t know about dinner or entrees here but it&#39;s up there with Union Station as a must do Denver destination in my book.

Our waiter explained happy hour to us, which sounded great! So we ordered 2 bottles of wine.  He brought two glasses of wine.  Before he even poured them, we corrected him, and told him that we ordered bottles, not glasses.  He told us he had to charge us for the glasses no matter what because he already took them from the bar.  We decided that was fine, go with the glasses, but THEN he also proceeded to bring the bottles to the table uncorked. okay....can&#39;t take those back either, since he uncorked them before he came to the table. What? So we just got two glasses of wine and two bottles of wine for two people??? It made no sense. Absolutely none. Of course when the bill came - no happy hour prices. Full prices, and somehow, nothing could be done to correct it. Interesting. We spent around $68 for happy hour wine instead of $24.53. Bait and switch?

The Mahi -Mahi was very good, however, so I did have a nice food experience.   Everyone seemed to like their entrees. 
We told our waiter it was my brothers birthday because I noticed 3 other tables get little candles on their dessert, but we did&#39;t get one - perhaps it was just our server.
We had creme brûlée for dessert, which we all liked. They did give us that to make up for the wine debacle...desserts are $7. Yay!

The table behind us was upset about their service the entire time, so I know we aren&#39;t the only people who were having issues.

Anyway, I want to like this restaurant and I think I would if our server wasn&#39;t a dingbat!
Yeah, I said dingbat, my grandma liked that word. :-)"

You are right next to a landing strip so if you enjoy aviation, you will have a great view of small aircraft taking off and landing. 

The one thing on the menu that I did not like was the lobster roll. Everything else was excellent.

The Perfect Landing is at the Centennial Airport down south - a bit hard to find but worth the drive for a little something different. Be sure to make a reservation - especially on the weekend and do be sure to pre-order your lobster or you might not get one. We learned this lesson the hard way. 

The grilled Caesar was new to me - romaine lettuce dipped in dressing, tossed on the grill and served with bread and parm cheese shavings. Yum. The $22 lobster special was delish  - 1 plus pound Maine lobster, deep fried corn on the cob - take a few bites to keep your cholesterol in check  - and a veggie. They also have very reasonable dinner specials including steak and salmon.- all for under $15.  

The decor is dated with some aviation related items. The service is just ok but the atmosphere is fun with &#34;Boogie Bob&#34; on the piano playing the oldies as well as contemporary tunes. There is definitely a geriatric crowd and it is not unusual for someone to stand up at the piano and belt out a tune - a sense of nostalgia fills the room and some of these folks have some chops!

They are just like adults if they are not comfortable they make more noise leading to disruption.

Good food. Chill atmosphere. Multiple televisions you can watch both inside and outside. Patio bar and rail as well as community tables. 

Beers rotate out weekly so stop in to see what&#39;s new. Full bar. Some nice spirits too so look over the whiskey or bourbon specifics. Mmmm. 

Four types of fries. Sweet potatoes. Truffle. Regular. Cajun fries.

Shakes. Boozy shakes! And a huge list of burgers. Generally I&#39;ll do the Medi Lamb or Southwest salad subbing a veggie patty. The El Chilango is worth trying. As is the Double Park, Croque, or Burger of the Sea. Something for everyone on the menu and it&#39;s a lot of fun to sub out patties or add toppings so make sure to try it all. 

The service has suffered in the past few months. Had some staff turnover but these things happen. Think a lot of regulars miss Dustin and Emily. Derek and Miles are awesome servers. Kevin goes above and beyond as well keeping up with his tables and loves to talk music.

Update 1 year later. 
What a difference a year makes. Customer service is not a priority here anymore. We used to come here for their happy hour. But the past 2 times we stopped by they didn&#39;t have the house beer which is $3 at happy hour. It feels like a bait and switch.....I asked the server if there was a substitution for the $3 beer and he said &#34;we are not obligated to offer substitutions&#34; I thought this was a very inappropriate, odd response. 
My recommendation is to go across the street to 10 Barrel for their amazing HH instead! 

Update 1 year plus....
We have been back twice now, indeed the service is much improved. The personnel is friendly and very accommodating. I was told that the management is new and indeed this seems to be reflected in the staff. The food, the happy hour prices are unbeatable. And it tastes great. Love the sliders!

TVs were showing multiple sports and the patio was flushed with groups. We were seated after about a 25 minute wait and had to wait about 20 minutes more before we got up to find a server. 

I got the house made veggie burger with lettuce, tomato, onion and the house sauce. I would have preferred more sauce because I couldn&#39;t really taste it. The veggie burger was typical and average. Not much seasoning and could have done with a spice such as cayenne or even a blend like Cajun. 

The table shared Parmesan truffle fries and regular fries. The truffle fries hardly had any truffle and were essentially regular fries with cheese. Everyone has their own preference and standard for a good fry. I measure quality for both fries and burgers by whether I have to add ketchup and mustard. I had to add the condiments to both. 

I&#39;m sure the beef options are great and since that is the focus of the restaurant are on par but for those of us who eat vegetarian it would be nice to have a more impressive option than the current patty."

I think of myself as a burger connoisseur and these burgers are great! I had the classic double with a basket of fries as I was hungry (always am ) the tastes were spot on, everything was cooked really well and the burger stayed in place throughout which is important. The basket of fries is really for 2 people but not impossible for 1. Just the right amount of salt and crispiness. Becca had the hotdog and salad which were also good and add just another perspective to the menu. 

A shake and a Arnold Palmer washed things down and they have a shake of the month which not surprising was sold out. A great place to stop and grab a bite to eat. They also have a bar with a couple of tv screens if you fancy watching a game. 

Only been to this location (a few times) so can&#39;t comment of other locations. Great job Park Burger!"

Of course everything is organic, fresh, local, otherwise hipsters (80% of the very local population) won&#39;t come...

The meat is juicy, the sweet potato fries are perfectly crispy and well seasoned and the sauces are good. The Al Scarpone option (pancetta, provolone, truffled garlic aioli) is a wise signature pick on the menu, and has won some sort of local Academy Award of the Burgers.

Service is friendly, although it can be a bit slow for a fast casual.
But the outdoor patio is just perfect to bathe in the neverending sun of Denver and to watch a Broncos&#39; game. 

So chill out and enjoy a slice of coloradean comfort cool way of life."

Four of us ordered the Scarpone (1/3 lb. patty, provolone, crispy pancetta
giardiniera &amp; truffled garlic aioli) . I LOVED IT! It was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth.

We ordered a full basket of truffle fries (the best of the 3!) and then a half basket of cajun fries (pretty spicy- not bad), and sweet potato fries (pretty good). If you get a basket of fries, I&#39;d recommend splitting it amongst 4 people. It&#39;s huge!

I will definitely come back to try more!"

After a (really) poor experience there we were afraid that the days of good burgers at PB were over. 

Fortunately the RiNo location still delivers the goods. We came for dinner on a Saturday evening and had no trouble getting immediate seating. We ordered the kettle chips with bleu cheese, and a variety of burgs. I had the Chilango, which had good flavor and was prepared just right. 

It does seem like PB&#39;s quality is starting to slide. I would guess they&#39;ve changed meat sources because the patties look a little different than the used to, and they aren&#39;t quite as good. I want to love this place, and the RiNo location is still best. But with the dramatically increasing number of places to eat in RiNo, PB can&#39;t afford to slack off. I still give four stars, but that is in part due to the great service we got from Kevin and the good (not great) mix of draft beers available."

For me, this place is just ok. We don&#39;t go when we are in a rush. You pretty much can always choose your own seat, but i think there is a certain place to choose so that you get noticed...  i haven&#39;t found it yet.

The patio is indeed fabulous! Beautiful space smooshed between building that makes you feel like you are in an oasis! Big garage doors that makes the inside feel like outside too!

The staff does what they can when they finally see you or get reminded that you are there.

I found all the appetizers to be just ok. The fries are again, just ok. The buffalo wings were not to my liking, hubby loves the pizza rolls (not me), The fried pickles are spears - just be aware. 

The burgers area tasty - i find the set options to not be as great as making your own, but as a bonus, if you decide to forgo the bun they happily put it on greens for you, which is fabulous! Or you can add one to any salad - even the set types.

The beer selection is huge, the boozy shakes look great - just haven&#39;t gotten there yet.

All in all i love more places to dine in the hood, and i know there is a cult following for Park Burger, i&#39;m just not in love yet.

Pro tip: rest room is out the back, and down the steps and around a couple corners, keep going, you&#39;ll find it. Sunday food ball has a special hh menu (point to that menu if you want that price). Also, if you aren&#39;t a football fan, maybe skip sunday all day and monday nights!"

The parking in this area has gotten even worse, but there was valet parking as an option. Outside a sign beckons with the words, &#34;Kitchen Open Late&#34;, which is nice to see and know about, especially if you&#39;re in the area.

Inside, lots of seating, plus seating in the bar area. There were a few TVs, if sports watching is your thing. There&#39;s a large amount of craft brews on the menu, as cider, wine and spirits.

The menu offers some salads. Ehh. The real star, in my book, are the burgers. I pretty much have one burger I want, which is a BBQ burger with fried onions, bacon, cheese and BBQ sauce. And it&#39;s delicious here.

We shared an order of fries (The Works), which were ridiculously good. Along with the cherry cider, it was a great meal."

Both the burgers were nice, the Lamb one had a good flavor but my hubby complained that the patty was tiny. So they were good but nothing to write home about.

As for quality and consistency, nothing has changed from my previous review. I still thank the Burger Gods for Park Burger. Since my first review, Park burger was featured on the Weekly Yelp as an awesome destination for summer milkshakes. I was nominated to do a video review on a spot featured on the Weekly Yelp. Because I had such a great experience there last time I decided why not go back? I&#39;m so glad I did.

This time, since I was filming the video, I was able to speak with TJ, the manager and get his and Ashley&#39;s (the bartender) recommendation for milkshakes. I went in with the attitude that milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard so I needed a little guidance as to what I should get.

TJ recommended the Rino because it tastes like a Reese&#39;s Peanut butter cup with banana. I went with Ashley&#39;s recommendation of the Golden Triangle. I live in the Golden Triangle area so it was fitting. It tasted like a York peppermint patty or a Thin Mint cookie in shake. It did the trick as far as satisfy my sweet tooth and serve me a little bit of alcohol. 

My friend ordered the park burger on a salad. She said it was delicious. I ordered the burger of the day. I wish I remembered all the details Ashley told me but all I can say is the sauce and the chalets of crispy onion where delicious. You can show your server/bartender the picture I posted of it if you want to try it. It was fantastic. And of course the truffle fries were on point again. 

Thank you Park burger for creating a wonderful space to relax and dine. Live music is always a plus as well as great DJ&#39;s spinning tunes. You are quickly becoming one of my go-to favorite spots. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try a different burger.


P.S. That milkshake did bring all the boys to the yard. HAHA"

Park burger was very professional, and fixed all my problems- and got my business back. They acted promptly, and I really appreciate that in a restaurant !!!!


I was so excited to try park burger for the first time. It was tough to decide from so many options- so many great sounding burgers, and great fish and veggie options! I tried the ahi burger, and it was disappointing. It was way over cooked, and just awful. I know this is Colorado, and I should not expect a lot from fish in comparison to a beach city, but it was worse than I could have imagined. I couldn&#39;t even eat it. I tried to inform the waitress Alyssa, but she couldn&#39;t be found. It was a Wednesday night- so not that busy, but apparently busy enough for a lack of service. She came by finally, and asked me if she could take the plate out of my way- I had taken two bites and cut through the fish to see how overcooked it was- I informed her yes please take it, and started telling her that it wasn&#39;t .... And she as gone- didn&#39;t even listen. I know she was busy, and it was loud, but I was mid sentence. Maybe I&#39;m used to restaurants where they are not just trying to turn tables for the next fare - but that&#39;s how I felt we were treated here. They didn&#39;t even care if we enjoyed our meals. 

 
  Our drinks were good, a good selection- they were delivered to the wrong people at the table, but they were charged correctly so no biggie there. 

   We had to ask several times to have the hockey game put on the tv- but eventually it happened. 

   The fries were delicious :) no denying that! The one good part of the meal- maybe it was because all I ate was fries.


     I hope this is read, and park burger seriously takes a better look at their customer service models."

I know it has been open for some time now, but I am behind lol.  Park Burger has a great location in RINO just across Broadway on Walnut St.  About half of the restuarant is inside and the other half is an outside patio that has considerable protection from wind.  (I have yet to go in the winter...)

The drink menu is really good.  I have always been shocked by a few of the beers on tap.  The first time I went I was able to have Consecration by Russian River on tap!  As always the tap list rotates, so I change my beer orders based on the menu.  There are also a bunch of alcoholic milkshakes!  I have yet to have one, but I have heard they are the best!

As you would expect Park Burger is known for their burgers.  The menu is solid and I have tried a different burger every time I have been in.  The burger I remember the most was the The Scarpone.  The burger consists pancetta, giardiniera &amp; truffled garlic aioli.  They also have a special burger which I have ordered the past few times, but I cannot remember the toppings.  For my side, I usually get the parmesan truffle fries as well.

The burgers are just... fine. Nothing to write home about, but you&#39;re likely to enjoy what you get.

It can be loud when it&#39;s sports ball time, which is a minus for me, maybe a plus for you. Last time we went around the brunch window, it was downright silly loud. Groups on both sides of us, loaded out with bored kids, and inattentive (except for the game) dads. Kinda annoying.

Went here yesterday and I opted for the Raspberry Princess beer to start, which was AWESOME. They have great beers on tap. Standard pricing hovers around $5 for a beer but some are as much as $10 for a good sour. I believe it is $2 off drafts during happy hour though.

The Royale Burger is the way to go, never disappoints. It has bacon and bleu cheese, what more could you want in life?

We also got a basket of truffle fries. The gang and I planned to just share a cup but got upsold. The basket was too big. The fries are amazing but definitely pretty heavy on top of your 1/3 pound burger. More than enough food for this girl.

I&#39;m hooked."

We were there during the week with a party of 7 and didn&#39;t have any problems getting a table. Our server was very attentive and quick to get our drinks and food out. I was debating between the O&#39;Neill and the Royale and our server recommended the O&#39;Neill. It had caramelized onions, apple slices, brie, and arugula and a balsamic glaze. Really good but messy! I had to end up using a knife and fork. The burger itself was very good, I did ask for mine to be cooked medium rare and it was more on the medium side (they cook the burgers medium unless you request something else). I felt the patty could have used a bit more seasoning, but the other ingredients were all fresh and worked well with it. Our table ordered baskets of sweet potato, cajun, regular, and truffle fries as well. The baskets aren&#39;t that much more than the small portion, so if you&#39;re with a bigger group, order the basket (which you can mix &amp; match as well). The burger was 1/3 lb so it wasn&#39;t huge and hit the spot. 

They also have  number of TVs, beer on tap, and boozy milkshakes I definitely recommend Park Burger if you&#39;re looking for gourmet burger in the area."

I think they are fine but nothing special at all. Being here during GABF, they went out of there way to stack the taps with beers you don&#39;t normally get in Colorado. The waitress was super helpful and knowledgeable so she really helped us make good decisions.

They did a good job with the patio keeping it secluded from the street noise and making it feel really inviting. They also have a ton of flat screen TV&#39;s inside that you can see from the patio so if you&#39;re up for a game then this is a great option.

I would absolutely come here for drinks and hanging out or watching a game. I think the food is the afterthought and if I were hungry I&#39;d grab something but I wouldn&#39;t go there just to eat again.

We always order the works fries which come with ranch, bacon, cheese sauce and scallions. I hate to sound like a pig, but they are never loaded enough - usually just the top layer!

The staff are a sharp, happy group of Denver&#39;s new breed of service industry, and you -will- hear their opinion on what the &#34;best&#34; burgers is (they are probably sporting the t-shirt to prove it).

I love milkshakes and it is one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. It was so hard for me not to slam it immediately.

Love the burgers, I usually get just a reg cheeseburger or the one with prosciutto on it (forget what it&#39;s called). The beer list is great, nice whisky, etc.

It has a nice ambiance, I&#39;m fine with the TVs because it&#39;s a burger place, whatever.

The service seemed to be a bit Effie at first, as the welcome, wasn&#39;t so welcoming, but the attentive service from the bartender helped the over all experience.  Plus, the other customers seemed to be living it up, and the Nuggets on HD was sweet."

The staff is friendly from the minute you walk in to the time you leave; very attentive.

Our waitress was awesome, and service for drinks, apps and main meal was quick. 

They had a live band, which I always adds to the atmosphere. With the place being a bit tiny I was afraid that they would be loud but they managed to stay at a decent level.

There were probably 3 other seated tables. Our waiter informed us he&#39;d been late for work and had to take gin shots as punishment. We could see the effect. 
First, he brought us the wrong drinks, which he later overcharged us for. 
Second, when asking him to describe an item, he named the four ingredients in the dish, then looked at the menu and re-read the description to us. We weren&#39;t sold. 
The kicker was when we asked for our checks. They arrived 10 minutes later (again with the wrong items charged), he came back to get our payment another 15 minutes later and finally brought back the slip for us to sign 10 more minutes later. 35 minutes to pay for your terrible service? No thanks. 

The sad part is that the food was pretty good, but it was spoiled by the absolutely terrible server. Enjoy your gin man, just not while you&#39;re waiting on us please."

I ate the green chili Benedict with confit pork shoulder. It was atop a grit cake. My honest thoughts - it was a great idea and concept, but I felt like it lacked some flavor with the green chili hollandaise (not enough green chili) and the pork shoulder was a bit salty for my taste. 

My boyfriend got the fried chicken and waffles. It came with a drumstick and a thigh with green chili on top and cheddar waffles. I would have preferred the green chili in a sauce form instead of just the green chilis because the dish did end up being a little dry. It did come with a side of maple syrup, though. 

All in all, it&#39;s not somewhere I&#39;d be dying to go back to, but would love to try their dinner menu."

The B^3 (Bloody Bacon Bourbon) bloody Mary was also amazing (the chincharon rim and the Pepperoncini Pepper flavoring was unique and excellent). I also sampled their rotating sour beer selection which was a cherry sour today. In general this place has a great atmosphere, friendly service, and an excellent selection of food, beer, spirits and cocktails.

As the name suggests the menu is divided right in the middle with half meat and vegetarian options. 

DECOR: I was super impressed by the tall ceilings and exposed beams of the dining space when I first walked in! The cool bar demands your attention. Then there&#39;s the upstairs lounge area with a separate bar overlooking the entire downstairs. This would be an ideal space for socializing with friends over drinks and watching games on the comfortable sectional couch! 

FOOD: I like their causal and non pretentious approach to the menu with an upscale flare. Don&#39;t get fooled by the simple menu, all the food is prepared with the best ingredients and unique flavors. We thoroughly enjoyed the steak, brisket and tofu French dip! The cut of the meat was excellent so were the flavors! Loved the gochujang sauce with the brisket! The crudités had fresh and pickled veggies in a tangy yogurt sauce - a great way to whet your appetite! I especially liked the sweet and savory combo of the cauliflower granola crumble! The tomato panzanella salad was very tasty as well. 

SERVICE: Our waiter Justin was probably one of the best waiters I&#39;ve had in Denver! He&#39;s well versed in the menu and provided his favorites. He was very attentive throughout the course of our dinner! 

VERDICT: excellent food, service and ambiance! Highly recommend this gem before it becomes a hot spot! You can easily find metered parking in the area since it&#39;s still a new area next to Union Station."

Really cool modern/industrial space on an up and coming corner just North of Union Station. Cool indoor/outdoor bar with soon-to-be outdoor seating. The aura is hip, young and cool. The finishes very nicely done with an upper loft lounge area. The USB connections are the bar are a nice touch!

Cocktails are creative alongside a few classics. Wine list is very nice with plenty of options by the glass not just your ho-hum wine menu!!  Cudos Anna to a very thoughtful list! I want to try them all!  Another nice touch is there is a short description, making it easier to choose something that suites each person. Quite an extensive tap of local beers. 

Menu is creative with both veg and meat heavy options. The price point is great. There is something for every budget here. Grandma&#39;s meatballs with grits and grilled bread was highly recommended by the excellent and friendly bartender Sashalyn and she was spot on.

I just tried the brisket tonight and my mind is pretty blown!  It is SICK brisket...sliced super thin, great flavor, really tender...solid sauce!  If I had to make one comment I would say my mouth watering leftovers were whisked away before I was asked if I had finished. I&#39;ll be dreaming of them the next few days with a bit of drool over the memory. 

Thrice cooked fries are also great and whole Colorado striped bass for two is DELICIOUS!  Spicey and limey!

Service has been great every time. Consistancy is huge for me. Trust the recommendations!  Owner was friendly, involved, &amp; present and they offer free wifi!  A great addition to this up-and-coming neighborhood!!

The steelhead trout was cooked to perfection!  So many places are afraid to cook fish correctly robbing patrons of the unctuous mouth feel and natural flavor of the fish . This dish was great. Very fresh spring:summertime salad served alongside. A nice value at $19. Portion was decent. If your looking for a lighter but satisfying dinner this is your dish."

It may have been due to the impending rain, but we had no trouble snagging a meter right out front. 

I liked the look of the place, open and industrial. The stools at the long communal tables in the middle aren&#39;t the most comfy though. 

I had the P&amp;S cordon bleu sandwich. While the chicken was well prepared, I thought this sandwich needed something crunchy with a tangy flavor. Pickles? some sort of slaw? Definitely something to cut through. 

I also subbed my fries for onion rings, this was a $4 dollar up charge. DON&#39;T do this. The fries were good - the onion rings were terrible. The batter was hard and on the tasteless side. They top their redneck burger with the rings, but I can&#39;t imagine having it on top of a burger, I imagine it would be hard to consume. The instagram photo that enticed me to come here came with nice brown onion rings. The ones I got were a beige, unappetizing color. Oh well.

My husband got the colorado burger which he had no trouble eating right up. We also splurged on an order of ice cream with brittle and plums. Nice way to end the meal, and at $6 the desserts were a fair price."

Our server had a large group, and for that I usually give them a break (on time to order, time for food to arrive, attentiveness to an almost-finished drink, etc.) But very simple things were missed- empty water pitchers at our table, an appetizer that was forgotten until half way through the meal, a cheese plate that was delivered without providing utensils or small plates, continuous forgotten drink orders... After a $50+ meal for one, I did not feel that my money was well spent. I was bummed because I chose the restaurant for the group, and my recommendation wasn&#39;t a winner- everyone at the table agreed the meal wasn&#39;t up to par."

Though the kitchen was still working out some kinks, our food was delicious. They were out of the pork confit benedict that I initially wanted, so I settled on the Sprout side of the menu and ordered the Mushroom Omelette. I actually wasn&#39;t too excited about it but when it arrived, it really surprised me with how tasty it was. A couple different types of mushrooms with grilled onions and parmesan and herbs, it made a really amazing combo. It also had simply dressed greens on the side which were super yummy. 
Hubs went big on the Pig side and ordered the Smoked Brisket Poutine. I had a few bites of it and enjoyed that too. The gravy was very flavorful and the eggs on top cooked perfectly. 
They have a deal at brunch for a Mimosa flight which gives you 3 different types of juices and a bottle of champagne for $25. I didn&#39;t partake but it looked really fun. 
The menu has a Pig side and a Sprout side. Pig obviously is meat centered and hearty, with the Sprout side being more vegetarian-oriented. I did notice that most (if not all) of their dishes had eggs. I think a little more variety would go far and the Sprout side (at brunch) could use even more vegetables in the dishes. 
I look forward to seeing how this place does. The staff is really friendly and very eager to work out any problems that arise. When you pair that with delicious food, you&#39;re typically looking at a win!"

The drinks were good.  I had the wine on tap and enjoyed it.  My fiancé had a Hot Mess which the bartender remade as she didn&#39;t like the way the first one turned out.  Can always appreciate the attention to detail.

I thought the menu layout was clever.  The left side was all meat and heavy dishes and the right was veggie and fish dishes.

I had the trout and enjoyed it, a little heavy on the pepper.  My fiancé had a meatball sub and enjoyed that as well.

I was a server for years and can tell you that&#39;s a pretty basic and fundamental skill that doesn&#39;t take much effort when you care about what you&#39;re doing. Chilled wine should be served immediately after opening. We watched our open bottle sit on the bar for quite a while before we finally asked another staff person to get it for us. The food was decent but just nothing memorable. I just didn&#39;t feel this was over a $200 dinner for four.

Didn&#39;t feel as tho it was a composed dish, seemed like just some ingredients thrown on a plate.  Next I had the cordon blue sandwich, sounds amazing and haven&#39;t had cordon blue for years so I figured why not...well..it was really bad, the bun was too soft, the chicken was huge and thick and not tender, it then was smothered in a white sauce which I&#39;m assuming was some type of mornay?  Whatever it was it made the sandwich extremely messy, and not desirable and the soft bun made it worse.  My wife had a salad and she didn&#39;t love it.

Just a simple salad but big on flavor and hit the spot as not too heavy for a late night meal. The brunch offering is somewhat newer but excellent. The mushroom omelet had just the right amount of caramelized onions to make it pop. The avocado and cheese breakfast sandwich was also good if a bit messy; maybe better to eat that open-faced and the home fries were incredible. Finally the bread pudding French toast was perfect. I ordered bacon on the side for just the right salty/sweet combo. No doubt I&#39;ll be craving that French toast until I go back again.

Trying not to let one hungover frat bro taint the experience, the food was subpar at best. Hold the lbs of butter as I do like to taste other ingredients on the plate...

Fries were good. My friend had the trout and it was delicious but the arugula salad that comes with it had way to much dressing. She also had the tomato and cucumber salad and it had these big chunks of croutons basically... Don&#39;t really recommend that... Don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll head back anytime soon but certainly wouldn&#39;t discourage anyone else from going.

I really appreciate the &#34;what you see is what you get&#34; attitude, that does not seem to have the slightest hint of pretention.  They serve all the traditional English pub ales, along with a solid selection of macro-brews and Colorado Craft offerings.  It is easy to come here, knock back a pint or two, and maybe have a wee dram of whisky on the side.  I usually wind up ordering food, even if it maybe is not quite yet time for a meal.  

I am a fan of the bangers and mash (three English sausages piled on top of mashed potatoes, covered with homemade brown gravy and sautéed onions
and served with a side of peas and carrots).  The traditional English breakfast is serviceable (two eggs served with rashers, bangers, baked beans, fried tomatoes, mushrooms and toast).  Even though they omitted the &#39;shrooms from my last order and should really be offering some black pudding as well.  And, the Indian pub food is more than adequate.

I popped in for a trivia night, and was glad that I did as soon as I saw the menu. The feel of the pub was exactly what I look for in a pub -- there&#39;s a jar of bottlecaps with a weekly contest to guess how may are in it, there&#39;s a bunch of fitting wall decor, there are neat little zones where people can claim their regular tables. 

To be fair, the British food itself wasn&#39;t too exciting, but it rarely is, and was mostly basic American bar food anyways. However, the samosas and the paneer were solid, and go way better with beer than most people expect. I&#39;d love to see places like this proliferate and begin experimenting with the kinds of post-commonwealth culinary fusions that can be found in the United Kingdom today."

Before I got there he ordered a prime rib thing for breakfast and said it was amazing. The parking situation looked bad upon pulling up, but there is some street parking (1 or 2 hour) around and there is a pretty big $2 lot in the back with lots of available spots.

I showed up late, stuck with standing room only which was fine because we were entranced by the game. The bartender was a petite brunette woman who was awesome at checking up on everyone to see if they needed anything. The crowd was extremely friendly and nice (on the Manchester United side!) There was singing, talking crap, and loud cheering throughout the game.

After the game was over, the place cleared out considerably. I was able to grab a seat finally and we had a couple friends join us. One of them ordered the Shepards pie, I tried a bite and it was amazing! Their entire menu looked good. The bartender said the Chicken Marsala is a big favorite under the Pakistani side of the menu. I wasn&#39;t hungry so didn&#39;t order anything but definitely will next time!

Only thing I would change is the bathrooms, they need some serious sprucing up and the lighting is horrendous, two burned out bulbs leave you wondering why they even bother having a mirror in there.

The fish and chips were good, the batter wasn&#39;t too greasy but the fries were a bit soggy, not sure if that had to do with the temperature of their oil or not.

My dish was spicy (in a good way) and the flavor on the meat and rice with his dish were incredible. Portion size was great; I couldn&#39;t even finish mine. I only wish there were more Pakistani options (hint,hint). If chicken handi appeared on the menu I might cry! 

The bartender/server (Coit) was awesome. He was the only one working on a Saturday and it was a packed bar (English Premier League Games). He took care of everyone and we were never left needing anything. It was awesome to see!! 

Definitely coming back!"

I&#39;ve passed this place countless times, but never stopped in until now. I had a craving for Fish and Chips, and decided to just go for it, and stop in. 

The outside just screams British Pub, so you can&#39;t miss this place. Once inside, the feeling of an authentic Pub continues, with a variety of soccer clubs lining the walls, and scores of recent matches on a huge chalk board. 

The service was very good and very fast, and they have the typical English beers as well as domestics. Happy hour is good, but no food discounts, only drinks.

I had the Fish and Chips, and my friend had the Bangers and Mash (he almost opted for the Full English Breakfast which looked good as well). The food was solid, and came very quickly. The place wasn&#39;t too busy, and I think we were the only ones ordering food, but the service was simply outstanding.

I would have given this place 5 stars, but the lack of food for happy hour and no darts to play left me wanting just a little more. All in all, a great place, and I will definitely go back to try some of the other food and watch the Spurs!"

I really wanted to partake in their menu, Pakistani and classic British Pub food.  Maybe on the next visit with more time and an emptier stomach I&#39;ll decide to partake in the excellent menu.  

Our Bartender, and cute little blond was absolutely stupendous and I may come back to see her again.  It was like being with family and I love that at a local bar.

You know..British pubs that serve surprisingly good Pakistani food. A downtown bar where white-collar mixes with blue. A dingy bar that has hand painted murals on the back of its seats.

British Bulldog is weird. But in a mostly good way. I like the draft selection, especially since it&#39;s one of the few bars in town that has Strongbow on tap. It has really good service. The food is a bit expensive, but definitely tasty. I love the kabob with the spicy sweet tamarind chutney. The fish and chips are also good, though I&#39;d wish they were a bit more generous with the cole slaw.

The menu is wonderfully bizarre with Greek, Pakistani, Indian, English, American and southwestern dishes all included.

If you are a fan of football, soccer for us Americans, then this is the place for you.  Sometimes they open early for the right matches.... April 1st, 5:30am Chelsea v Man U!  The service is superb.

The food is the traditional British pub fare.  Plus they also have a Pakistan menu with a wide range of curry&#39;s.  I love the chicken masala lunch special.  Such a great value.  Check out their rotating lunch specials as well.  If you buy 9, your 10th is free.  Great for people working downtown who can catch a soccer match over lunch!

The beer selection is very unique as well.  They have a good selection of Great Divide along with the traditional American beers, plus the main pub beers as well. 

Also, as the Bulldog is a main soccer bar for Denver, you can catch a shuttle to the Colorado Rapids games for only $10!  And that includes a beer!  Don&#39;t drive.  Take the C38 shuttle and you will have a blast!"

It&#39;s located just far enough from anything to be labeled as a dive, but with enough character to have it holds its ground. The place has an old-UK feel right from the get-go, soccer games blaring on the screens, and a chill patio on-looking... pretty much nothing.

But the secret here isn&#39;t the location or the lack of beautiful mountain views, it&#39;s the inconspicuous Pakistani food menu. If you&#39;re into spicy food, you&#39;re going to have to take the challenge here.

Grab the slow-cooked lamb or chicken tikka masala. Either option will test your limits on what &#39;spicy food&#39; truly is (and they don&#39;t hold back the portions either). If you manage to finish your dish without drinking half a gallon of water, don&#39;t expect any nods of approval from anyone around you. Just know that you&#39;ve taken in one of the most simple, blissful experiences Denver has to offer."

It&#39;s a great description of an English style pub. The food is pretty good for standard bar fare. You can&#39;t go wrong with a burger, and their fries are solid. Even the up-tight Downtown Cherry Creek type bitches and post-frat guys seem to mellow out at this chilled out bar. Drink a Boddington&#39;s and grab a table.

Friendly service and clientele, good beer, soccer on TV, and amazing food. Three in our group got the fish and chips, (huge portions, perfectly battered) and all loved it, and the Cheesy Mess burger is one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. I was disappointed to not find Cornish pasties on the menu, but the samosas made up for that fully. Spicy and delicious with addicting crust.

The Bulldog opens early for weekend soccer matches. Especially for the Chelsea FC fans. The Rocky Mountain Blues come out strong for even the 6am matches. There are alot of other supporters that show up here too, so dont shy away! The bar gets especially rowdy for big matches...probably the most fun I have ever had in a bar was the Champions League Final in 2012 here. Packed to the gills with Bayern and Chelsea fans..you would think you are in Europe!

The Bulldog does the pub style right. Not only do that have great pub food (fish n chips, burgers, etc), they have AMAZING Pakistani/Indian food. Seriously..its good. I know this may confuse some but in England its very common. Try the masala its awesome. They also have a very good cheesesteak. If you come for an early soccer match worry not...the breakfast is awesome too.

The have some pretty good lunch and happy hour specials too. My favorite is coming in for a lunchtime Champions League match on masala Wednesdays. $7.99 for the masala and a drink. The service here has always been great too, Matt kills it on the bar at 6am!"

While some people have defected, this place still remains a landmark of soccer pride. I&#39;m here for every game my team plays along with my buddies. 

Strangers in this bar typically know their soccer. You can get into friendly debates/chats with anyone there. It is incredibly easy to meet new people and enjoy a game. There can be a drunk heckler or two every so often, but let glory hunters be glory hunters.

The staff is awesome. They all know me. By the second time I had come in, the Owner knew who I was (Jon) but he now is in charge of the Three Lions. The head chef and I support the same team so we talk a lot. The current owner (Wendi) knows everyone&#39;s drink of choice and everyone else is awesome.

I&#39;ve had some of the best food ever here. I was hesitant to try Pakistani but jeez! Masala Wednesdays! Peshawari Tuesdays! They recently introduced a &#34;curry burger&#34; that is worth the trip even if there isn&#39;t a game. Pakistani served with cilantro chutney, rice, and pita, fantastic.

The Punjabi chicken wings were tossed in a sweet, spicy and tangy sauce and served with a side of grilled pita bread. Truly a really great new way to prepare your classic bar staple.

This authentically English pub is comfortable and homey, slightly dim without being too dark.  It&#39;s obviously a well-loved neighborhood watering hole.  I was delighted to find plentiful and easy free parking close by.

I can&#39;t comment on the beer menu, except to say that it&#39;s conveniently located on the napkin holders atop the tables.  I opted for the $5.00 chardonnay (your one and only choice of CK Mondavi) and my glass was filled to the top.  Hmmm, they must know me.  Of course, there is also a selection of spirits.

The food menu is a collection of the usual American and British pub fare plus an offering of Pakistani dishes.  I was game to try one of those but leery of the curry flavors.  Our absolutely amazing server (sadly, I didn&#39;t get her name, but she has short blonde hair and glasses and is originally from Ohio; don&#39;t ask me how I know that but don&#39;t know her name!) helped me chose the Chapli kebab salad.  The kebabs are made with minced ground beef and spices and look sort of like flat seared sliders.  They were so flavorful and had a nice spicy kick to them.  The lettuce in the salad was fresh and tasty.  The only veggie was tomatoes but it really didn&#39;t need anything else.  The salad came with sides of the tamarind sauce and cilantro chutney, both of which I enjoyed but the cilantro chutney was my favorite of the two.  I also had a bite of the chicken masala and it was surprisingly not too heavy on the curry.  I would not be afraid to order it next time.

So if you seek a friendly pub to remind you of Merry Old England, whether for a rowdy soccer match or for a quiet pint and some dinner, you will find it at British Bulldog."

The food is by far and away the best pub food in Denver.  They actually do quite a bit of Middle Eastern inspired foods.  They are really flavorful and filling.  Of course you can get your traditional fish and chips, and they aren&#39;t overly battered.

The beer selection is good, although they ran out of Irish Stout tonight.

I got fish and chips, which were absolutely awesome. Even just their chips were great. My friends all had local beers, which they liked enough to later check out the brewery. Only problem was that a strong smell of cigarette smoke was hanging around the whole time, which kind of screwed with my sinuses as well as the taste of the food here and there.

I have a vested interest for two reasons:  proximity to my place, and soccer!!!

Added to that is a variety of English fare and Pakistani dishes.  True to England itself where English and Indian foods are most common.  Pretty large menu.  Try the wings they are spicy and there is enough to take some home!

The staff is friendly and family like, much like a pub should be.   They&#39;ve already advised me on where I can go to play pick up soccer and ppl to talk to.  In addition they plan several events with the Rapids and do trivia on Mondays.  To make it easy on us they submit an email reminder at least weekly.  

To be honest, I am trying NOT to go there too much.  Good for you Bulldog!

I wasn&#39;t too crazy about the service.  I stood almost the entire match with no beverage.  I wasn&#39;t rude to the staff.... I just stood there trying to make eye contact whenever a bartender came to my end of the bar.  I made eye contact a couple times.... but I guess a guy standing with no drink doesn&#39;t convey the message in this bar.  Their loss.

Food review:  I was brought in here by curiosity from my last visit here when I only did drinks.  Pakistini food in an British pub, eh?  OK, gotta try it out!  :-)  So came in here for lunch.  Started out with the chips and curry.  The curry was a bit different than I expected it to be (more of a chili variety) but that ended up turning out pretty well.  Had a little zing to it as well which I would find out really soon that that would be the theme for the rest of my meal.  Starting digging into the aloo and oooff... was it ever spicy but tasty never the less.  The rice that came with it wasn&#39;t as spicy but it had a zing to it as well.  The meal also came with flatbread which had a really nice texture to it and complemented the aloo nicely.  Overall, BB was a very nice surprise for me.  I was really impressed of the quality of my meal for it being a pub.

My girlfriend and I flew here on a business conference out of Nashville. Having seen this place over the first couple days, I thought it would be a cool place to visit. So on our last night in town, we walked two miles to get to this place. When we arrived there was no one to seat us or greet us. After a lot of digging, we finally found a table.  The server hadn&#39;t picked up the tab from the last patrons, so we decided to wait until someone came to wait on us to give them the money. Five minutes later, no signs of life from the staff. Plenty of them looked our way, but no attention, no one to say, &#34;One moment and I&#39;ll be right with you.&#34; When I flagged a staffer down, he shook his head &#34;no&#34; at me and waved me off. When he finally came around, we told him about the bill, then promptly left. It is amazing this place does business. Most establishments know they&#39;re not in the fish and chips business or the beer business or even the sports bar business.

I ordered the fish and chips and they were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The fries were okay, but the fish was very, very good.

British Bulldog, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...

I love the fish and chips.  The batter is delicious, and they&#39;re not too greasy but of course greasy enough to be delicious.  The chipotle tartar sauce is just spicy enough to make it awesome.

I love the burgers.  Juicy and flavorful with fresh vegetables, if you&#39;re going to splurge calories on a burger, you want it to taste like this.

I love the selection of beers.  Good selection on tap, there will be something there you want.

I love the happy hours! It seems like there&#39;s always something on special. 

I love the service.  Friendly, quick, not an ounce of too-cool.

I love the funky booths with the painted forest scenes.

I love that the bathroom was surprisingly pleasant for a bar.

I love the little patio with its perfect, unobstructed view of Coors field and its fireworks.

I love that they have a theme, especially because I love dogs and think bulldogs are adorable.

I love the free bingo on Wednesdays!

And finally I love that they play football games.  That&#39;s soccer to you Americans. :)

Edited to add:

They don&#39;t do bingo anymore, but they do have an Adult Spelling Bee every third Thursday!  Adult as in...for grown-ups, not rated X. :)"

I thought I was too, because I almost went back in and got a few more. I got lunch as I was doing errands, and after the tacos cancelled everything as I needed to see what the burrito was all about. Granted, Mexican food isn&#39;t all that complicated-tortilla, beans, rice, meat- but this place is doing something right to get me to stop eating and write a review.

It came with a fresh side of fruit salsa, which was soooo good! He also had a tamale, which wasn&#39;t very good.

This. Is. It. 

The owner/cook welcomes you as you come in. Menu is easy to read and I can not believe how fast the food is prepared. Kitchen is right behind the register and she makes everything cooked to order. 

We tried 3 variations of the teriyaki chicken, a bowl, a plate with veggies and the spicy chicken. My brother got the noodle bowl with veggies and chicken and it looked good as well. 

Teriyaki chicken dishes were prepared perfectly. Chicken wasn&#39;t dry and there was just enough teriyaki sauce. Rice was plentiful, large portions. The spicy chicken was spicy! But good! Veggies were crisp and not over cooked. Overall a great meal for a reasonable price!"

i was the very 1st customer for the day.  like other reviews, its no frill place. have ~10 tables with each with soy sauce and it was definitely minimalist with nothing else. if you need extra, u will need to ask.

i got the spicy chicken teriyaki and salmon teriyaki off the new menu and definitely recommend both.  chicken teriyaki was moist, had lots of flavor and came with side of teriyaki sauce.  plenty of rice to fill you up and also grilled vegetables  (cabbage/broccoli) came with it.  salmon was even better to my liking.  grilled to perfection with side of ginger sauce that was perfect for either dipping or pour over the salmon.

it was my very first time and will return."

It&#39;s a small hole in the wall place but don&#39;t let that deter you. When I walked in there was nobody else inside.

I ordered the #1 teriyaki beef and chicken combination plate with veggies ($8.99). The chicken was a little dry and the beef was thinly cut so they didn&#39;t have a lot of moisture from cooking. Maybe it was because we were the first ones in for lunch, who knows!

My wife picked up the #2 chicken teriyaki and gyoza combination plate with veggies ($8.99) and the gyoza and chicken were perfectly moist. I could eat a dozen gyoza from here no problem.

Maybe it&#39;s because we were the only ones there at around noon, but it seemed like even though the food was cooked when ordered that the ingredients were out for a while.

The restaurant is small, but cozy and staffed by a very friendly woman who acts as both chef and hostess.

I had the Veggie Bowl, which was pretty tasty for how simple it was -- a bed of rice covered with stir-fry veggies (cabbage, carrots, broccoli, and maybe sesame oil). I, of course, added some hot chili sauce and a bit of teriyaki sauce; I like my food spicy!

My sister had the spicy chicken, which she said was very yummy!

The bowl was disappointing...chicken was on the tough/dry side and the spicy was just a ton of chili sauce stirred in.

The woman, who I assume is the owner, was a one woman show. She took our orders, prepared the food extremely quickly (there was a microwave involved, so not quite as hard as it sounds), brought it to us, and refilled our drinks. Impressive.

The food, however, was nothing special. My sesame chicken had clearly been microwaved, but it was an alright dish for an alright price.

I&#39;m also not a fan of when a restaurant owner feels the need to throw their religious symbolism all over the place, but such is their right.

My wife absolutely loves the Chipotle Seafood dish.  I have had the seafood burritos and the special burrito, both were great and far BEYOND any chain restaurant flavor that I have ever tried.  I am sorry to hear the bad reviews as family owned, small businesses always get out first look and our experiences have been positive.  
  The service has always been great too.  We showed up at 10 minutes before closing last night and got exceptional service and well presented, cooked food.  I know I am willing to keep going to El Trio.  I give it 5 stars for overall value, taste, menu selection, and service.

The place is clean and servers are kind and there IS cheese on their arroz con pollo as seen on lunch menu, and I enjoyed it very much!  Will. E back for tacos.

Coming back for tacos was a mistake. They are served on Taco Bell style taco shells and the meet is overly spice and greasy. The crispy chili Riano was very good stuffed with plenty of cheese and the sauce was good.   Why can&#39;t any so-called authentic Mexican restaurants just use regular tortillas and not the prefab taco shells?????  The very kind appearing waitress took our drink order; drinks game within five minutes, food came within 10 minutes and then we never saw her again until she brought the bill. No drink refills."

When we arrived we (nor anyone else) addressed for about 15 minutes. When we were, we were asked to sign ourselves in on a piece of paper. Finally got seated. Ordered a margarita.... then our waitress disappeared for about 15 minutes. Checked in and said my margarita was coming she just needed to grab it. Took our order. Waitress disappears for 30 minutes. Comes back saying &#34;I&#39;m so sorry it took so long, the bartender was so busy I had to go back there and make it myself!&#34; At this point I didn&#39;t even want the margarita I just wanted to go home. The bus boy was the most attentive person in the entire restaurant! When we finally got our food it was actually pretty good! The carne Asada was delicious! But regardless, I will never return to this restaurant. Good food can make up for bad service, but not that bad of service."

I noticed literally no difference in the food when it switched from 3 Portrillos to El Trio. Their chicken mole is gross. Little strips of chopped up, sad, overcooked chicken in a sauce hardly discernable as mole, topped with a ton of sesame seeds. Gross. 

One night I tried to stop in and they were really busy. Figured I would grab a drink at the bar.... not so much. Stood there for 20 minutes and was never so much as glanced at. The bartender must have called in or something, because there was a waitress back there trying to make a margarita, frantically flipping through pages in a book of cocktail recipes. She finally started crying about how she couldn&#39;t do it and stormed out from behind the bar. Trust me, there are waaaaay better places near by. Casa Mariachi blows this place out of the water, as does Real de Minas."

I got their &#34;signature dish&#34;... Arroz con Pollo.   I was wickedly hungry, so the bar should have been pretty low.  Normally, Arroz con Pollo has a ton of cheese.  I asked if their version had a ton of cheese.  I was assured that it did.  It had almost zero cheese.  At the end of the day, it wasn&#39;t horrendous.  It was edible.  But it was BARELY better than a frozen Mexican stir-fry thing from the grocery store.  Very bland and not impressive at all.

********************

Update 2016.05.06:  I&#39;ve been told by two Yelpers so far that I shouldn&#39;t expect cheese on this dish.  In fact, I was told that I should just &#34;Google it&#34;. 

Here&#39;s the issue.  At 3 Margaritas (a chain), it has a ton of cheese.  And it&#39;s AWESOME.  I&#39;ve had it at at least one other place, where it also had a ton of cheese.  Also, damn good.  I can&#39;t remember the name(s) of the other place(s).  Notwithstanding that, the menu description on El Trio&#39;s own web site says, &#34;Arroz con Pollo ($13.95) - Our Signature Item! Tender sliced chicken breast specially prepared with fresh mushrooms, onions, and green peppers, served on a bed of rice with MELTED CHEESE - topped with our homemade sauce. (Not served with beans).&#34;  [I capitalized the &#34;melted cheese&#34; part for emphasis, so nobody would miss it.]

On top of that, I asked the server if the dish indeed had &#34;a lot of cheese&#34;, because that&#39;s the kind of thing I wanted on that occasion. She said that it has &#34;a TON of cheese.&#34;  So whether or not the dish is &#34;officially&#34; supposed to have melted cheese, according to Google or anybody else, is absolutely irrelevant.  Even without much cheese, if it was good, or even decent, I would not have given it a 1 star rating.

Moreover... forget the cheese for a moment, and whether or not is should or should not have been included in the dish... my comment was that it was &#34;BARELY better than a frozen Mexican stir-fry thing form the grocery store.  Very bland and not impressive at all&#34;.  Thus, I&#34;m standing by my 1 star rating.

I&#39;ll try the place again and attempt something different.  Again, I REALLY WANT TO LIKE IT, because it&#39;s so close to where I live.  If I have something better, I&#39;ll post about it.

Under the previous management, some of the food wasn&#39;t that great, but I proudly proclaim that the crispy chile rellenos were OUTSTANDING.  I&#39;m hoping that dish is still there and is as good under the new management.  If so, post about it."

We came on a Friday night, at 6, and we were seated right away, perhaps my first indication it still left something to be desired. I got the house margarita, which was a typical variety mix, sweet and sour margarita. For food, my son ordered the buffalo wings from appetizer menu, and they were decent. I ordered the deluxe chimichanga (on the side order menu) with shredded beef. The menu describes it as being smothered in tomato sauce, so I asked the server what the tomato sauce was, and she described it as a red chile, so I asked for it on the side. My daughter ordered chicken nuggets off the kids menu (which is $5.50 not including a drink, so add $2.25 for a soft drink) and they came out dark dark brown. They tasted so much like fry oil they were practically inedible. My chimichanga came out small, poorly stuffed, and smothered in what I can only describe as Pace picante (not on the side as requested, and nothing like a red chile at all). I would have asked for replacements, but our food took 30 min to come out to begin with and I honestly didn&#39;t have time. Not to mention the server barely made eye contact with us. I had to ask her for straws for the kids drinks, water I asked for three times before it arrived - at the end of our meal, and our plates were never cleared before I had a chance to chase her down with my credit card so we could get out of there in under an hour and a half.  
The only reason I gave this review 3 stars is A) I&#39;m not heartless, B) the wings were decent, and C) there was a Busser and what may have been a manager rushing around and they seemed to care about good service. All in all, I would say keep driving.... There are better Mexican restaurants in Parker."

Our waiter had a joking attitude but really took care of us; I appreciate a wine bar that doesn&#39;t snub you when you taste a wine and decide it&#39;s not at all what you wanted (I tried a Sauvignon Blanc that was super acidic and got a Rose instead per the good recommendation of the waiter). We also could pick and choose for our cheese plate (we don&#39;t like blue cheese) which was actually fun to decide what fruits (apples, fig jam, etc.) paired best together.

I had the scallops with heirloom tomatoes and Parmesan risotto that was really good - not a tomato sauce in taste at all, slightly sweet. The risotto might make me a believer (it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever tried to cook myself so enjoy the indulgence). My finance had the filet and   we both finished our whole plate. We then also (did we really have room?) shared the molton cake which was a bit disappointing as the &#34;molton&#34; part was poured on top and not inside at all - just flourless. I&#39;d skip it next time.

Overall, this place was a good, intimate setting and ideal for a last minute date night. They don&#39;t take reservations so walk-ins (especially early, we were there at 5 on a Saturday) are taken care of quickly in the super small entry way. Probably a little on the pricey side but we did order it all - no happy hour on weekends."

You can really feel like you&#39;re in a nice wine bar with great wines while visiting as they do an excellent job of decorating and displaying here... It&#39;s similar to being in an elaborate wine cellar. We&#39;re definitely stopping back in here next time we&#39;re in town!"

I would go somewhere else that offers wine that&#39;s much cheaper. A lot of places in Larimer Square are a lot cheaper and the staff actually cares about you.

Also, the food wasn&#39;t even that good. We got a meat and cheese platter and the portions were so small, overpriced and not even that great of a variety of food."

Its location on Larimer St is great and we sat at a small table outside so we could people watch (and admire the valets&#39; parking skills). Our server, Michael, was also highly entertaining and knowledgeable about the menu.

My friend and I shared the cheese fondue to start. It was delicious - super creamy and flavorful. It came with apples, pears, butternut squash, brussel sprouts, and pita. I really enjoyed dipping all of the fruits and vegetables, although I was skeptical at first about some of them. The pita was a little hard but did its job serving as a vehicle for the cheese. When we ran out of dippers, we asked Michael for some more, and he brought us another plate of fruit and pita. We also each ordered a glass of wine, since it is a wine bar, after all. I am not a wine connoisseur, but the one that I selected did go well with my meal.

For the main course, she ordered the braised short ribs, which were really tender and flavorful. I was debating between the filet mignon and the Waygu sirloin, and was told to contemplate whether I was more interested in tenderness or flavor profile, respectively. I ended up picking the Waygu, since it&#39;s more difficult to get. The entire meal felt extremely luxurious, as the meat was paired with thin-cut truffle fries and buttery haricot verts. Yum!"

I must say I thoroughly enjoyed my Ahi Tartare. It was so fresh and anything with Avocado makes my day. My friend had these delicious Parmesan Risotto.

The 2nd time I came here was due to a 45-1.5h wait time @ Vendome &amp; Euclid. Fortunately, I was with my dad who is a wine enthusiast and he was excited that we&#39;d be eating at my third option. Wine flights here range from $11-$20 for a 3 wine tastings that add up to the amount you&#39;d get in 1 glass of wine. There are various flight options to choose from (white or red, etc.) and the waiters bring the flights to you with a cool metal rack that keeps the wine glasses aligned. The wine flights that are featured right now on their online menu are different than the menu options I was given when I was here less than a week ago. 
What I tried:

1. $15 Charcuterie board - DELICIOUS and was so cute. It came with a mini butcher&#39;s knife (the first of it&#39;s kind that I&#39;ve ever seen). Prosciutto + salami + manchego cheese
foie gras mousse + antipasti + rustic bread
2. $15 cru steak stone fire pizza-beef tenderloin + red onion + mixed greens + balsamic
3. $11 grilled cheese &amp; tomato basil soup-taleggio cheese panini + white truffle oil + tomato basil soup
4. $25 filet mignon-6 oz filet of beef + potato-fennel gratin + haricot vert
maytag blue cheese + rosemary chianti sauce. GREAT value and was probably the softest/most tender meat I&#39;ve ever had

I&#39;ve dined in both their main floor and their basement. The basement is cute but can get rowdy and loud. They should install some kind of sound-proof foam on their ceilings or something to absorb the noise because it was almost hard to have a conversation down there when the place gets crowded. Their main floor has high ceilings with a back wall that features a ton of wines. If you sign up for their e-mail newsletter, you&#39;ll get tons of great deals, promotions and event notifications. You can also get a free item if here if it&#39;s your anniversary (if you&#39;re on their e-mail list)."

My initial thought when I entered the restaurant was that it was a very small space, but they have a downstairs area that is cozy and doubles the restaurant&#39;s size. The happy hour goes until 6:30, which is so nice when every other happy hour in Larimer Square seems to end at 6, and it&#39;s $3 off all flights and glasses of wine and some deals on select food items.

I do want to acknowledge the great customer service we had. It was busy, but our waiter was friendly and on top of things. We had a large group with people arriving over time, and our waiter if inconvenienced, never let it show."

We came in here before our reservation at Vendome for some vino (of course), and loved it! If we hadn&#39;t been going to Vendome, I might have wished we didn&#39;t have dinner plans because their food menu looked really good too!

Anyway, we found four seats together at the bar - selected our tasting flights and away we went. It was actually pretty neat to sit at the bar as I thought the bartender was really cool and very knowledgeable. Fun fact - they go through a lot of wine here (duh!), but they are constantly changing the wines on their tasting flights and by the glass menus! I thought that was kind of neat - that you could come back in a couple of weeks and have an entirely different wine experience. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back and try some more vino....and OMG the Inniskillin dessert wine....so good...actually nevermind, don&#39;t get that - you won&#39;t like it. Leave it all for me! :)"

For my birthday, I made reservations for 12 a week ahead of time.  The day of the reservation, I called to confirm and learned that the restaurant was closed for renovations.  I did not receive notification from the restaurant that they would not be able to honor the reservation, and if I had not called to confirm, a group of 12 would have showed up to a closed restaurant.  Upon learning this just 2 hours before the reservation time, the general manager told me that he would call me the next day with a certificate for free meal for 2 to the restaurant.  I still haven&#39;t heard back from him.

For a restaurant that calls themselves a &#34;premier destination&#34; should really think about their poor customer service.

I would give it five stars but there was a little confusion on my orders when I was last here. I went during happy hour and order a flight of wine ($5 off) and some of the appetizers that were on the happy hour menu. I only knew of happy hour because I looked it up online. I wasn&#39;t given a menu or told about it. I asked the waiter if it was still happy hours and he acknowledged that yes it was still happy hour. So my assumption was that he understood that my order was off the happy hour menu and I even asked how big the portions were. He told me they were good size. I was a little shocked because happy hour deals are usually half portions or something like that. The food came and it was great. We had the mussels, fig bruschetta, marrow, and the goats cheese fritters. I had to ask for more bread because the sauce on the mussels was heaven!  It was all really tasty. I will definitely be back. The portions were definitely a good size. The check came and the bill was not what we were expecting. We talked to the waiter and he fixed us a deal. He didn&#39;t not understand that I was ordering from the happy hour food menu. Even still it was delicious and they were willing to correct the error. I was satisfied with the way they handled the whole thing. I only take off one star due to the fact that even though they were on happy hour I was never told about it and even after I made the reference I still never saw a menu. I do see how selling happy hour items prohibits profits for both waiter and restaurant but I like to dine and try all kinds of different stuff. It would have only left room for more exploring. I guess I&#39;ll just have to go back."

The wine was perfect, I had a flight of cab&#39;s and then had a flight of their rose&#39;s (all dry wines). 

I also had a cheese plate - they let me substitute one of cheeses for something else which is great to know for next time. There was a group of people that came in after me that were offered their happy hour tapas menus.... I didn&#39;t get a chance to look at that or know it exists, but I&#39;d already ordered the cheeses and decided to stick with that choice. Next time I&#39;ll check out their other options.

The only thing I&#39;d have reservations about is their prices don&#39;t make it very conducive for a regular happy hour. There are other places in the vicinity that offer fantastic wines for a better deal. I&#39;ll still make it back to try more though! Just not as much as I would like."

I had the grilled cheese. They use specialty cheese and it comes with tomato soup. They served fresh grapes as well, but the fruit may be seasonal. The portion size was a little smaller than I was expecting, but it&#39;s perfect if you&#39;re looking for a small meal to keep you from enjoying your wine flight a tad too much!

I had the Riesling wine flight. I enjoyed it. It was served from dry to sweet (don&#39;t let the smells deceive you!). A glass of wine is six ounces here and the flights are a set of three 2-oz pours. That way, you can enjoy sampling with out getting too tipsy. 

The service was friendly and knowledgable, but pretty slow. I might not have noticed, but it made me run a little late to the show I was about to catch. I&#39;d recommend the patio when it&#39;s a great day outside!"

The service was wonderful, and it&#39;s a good thing we decided to lunch rather than dinner because our group of 11 or so easily took up half the main dining area! (For a date night, this is a great setting, but our group is rather loud and I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t ruin any one else&#39;s experience simply by proximity). 

First and foremost as a wine bar I was impressed with the selection and really loved the idea of a flight of wines. Each flight is presented with an information card to provide details of the wines you have in front of you.

Most of the food was fantastic. The Goat Cheese Beignets  were probably one of the best things I&#39;ve eaten, anywhere, ever! As a group we got a few cheese plates, the Crispy Baby Artichokes and the Lobster &amp; Shrimp Potstickers for the table, all of them were delicious. It was rather difficult to keep track of what cheese was what (an information card would have been helpful here!) but nonetheless everything was delicious. 

The only real flops I experienced were the Golden Beet Salad and the steamed mussels. Beets have always been one of my favorite foods, no matter how it&#39;s prepared, but somehow this just fell short. The beets were flavorless and the salad itself, while dressed, may as well have not been. There were blood oranges on the plate, but the dish definitely lacked a bit of acidity. 

The mussels REALLY fell short. Firstly they were the teeniest mussels I have ever seen! Now, I do not blame the restaurant for this. This is what they were provided- whether this is what they are typically serving or not I cannot say, but I&#39;d like to think they normally serve higher quality considering everything else at the restaurant was so wonderful. The size itself really wouldn&#39;t have mattered if the flavor had been better. There was nothing to the broth they were cooked in. No hint of garlic, chardonnay, shallots... nothing. The only word that comes to mind to describe the beet salad and the mussels is underwhelming. 

My sister and I had split these few small plate items for our meal and were, as I mentioned, underwhelmed by all but the Goat Cheese Beignets- which I HIGHLY recommend. It was difficult to give them up, but we made sure everyone at our table had a bite!

All in all it was a good experience. Again, our party (my large and very loud family) can be overwhelming and the staff did a great job of taking care of us. The food, for the most part was wonderful. Everyone else at our table thoroughly enjoyed their dishes. 

In the end, I will definitely come here again (even if it&#39;s just for the beignets and champagne!) and I would absolutely recommend this place to any of my friends!"

This place is amazing! The food and the atmosphere was awesome. The appetizers are perfect for sharing multiple, and believe me you&#39;ll want to because everything sounds so good. 

My roomie and I shared the fondue plate, artichoke, and of course had to try the Gorgonzola pear pizza.

The fondue was delicious, awesome sides for dipping, the apples were my favorite. It must be said that I am not typically a fan of artichoke but it was perfect, the sauce, the crispy, the almost melt in your mouth... I&#39;d order it tomorrow... I&#39;m not going to lie, the pizza was good but not amazing. Ask me tomorrow when I reheat it if my opinion is the same but perhaps more pears less red onion would have been better for my taste buds.

When you walk in, the restaurant is immediately warm and inviting. The space looks small but they do have additional seating on the lower level. This was a first visit and I was happy with my choice as soon as I walked in. 

To start, I ordered the Spicy Reds flight (I think it was N. 12) and my husband had the Sauv Blanc flight (I think it was N. 2). We were really delighted by both selections. I particularly loved the tempranillo in my flight and the Sancerre in his, so much so that I ordered a glass of the Sancerre with my dinner. So far, off to a good start.

We ordered the fondue and frito misto for our appetizers. Overall, the fondue was spectacular. The combination of cheeses was really interesting and left us wishing we had gotten 2 orders. The frito misto was... good but the fried calamari was a little limp and oily tasting. Also, the portion just seemed a bit small. It was fine, but nothing to write home about. Maybe I&#39;ll order the crab cakes another time. Those looked promising. I really wanted to order the mussels but unfortunately, they were out. Oh wells, another time.

For the main dish, I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the filet. His filet came with a lovely rosemary chianti sauce and blue cheese butter. It was a perfect medium-rare and he really enjoyed it. My salmon, while cooked perfectly, was a little boring. I think this is just what happens with salmon. I should remember to order more daring dishes next time I go out, but the options were rather limited. I might go for the scallops if you&#39;re interesting in seafood. 

For dessert, we ordered the chocolate molten cake and the creme brulee. The chocolate cake was truly perfect. It was everything a molten chocolate cake should be. The whipped cream was thick and sweet and perfectly delicious. The only thing I could have done without was the raspberry sauce. It was overly sweet and masked any chocolate/cream flavor. I might request the sauce on the side or have them skip it altogether. The creme brulee was... creme brulee. I imagine it&#39;s hard to mess it up. 

The service was pretty attentive. My husband couldn&#39;t decide on a red wine for the steak and the server brought over 3 different wines for him to try, which was really nice. I&#39;m sure part of that was because he was a nice guy and part of it was because the restaurant was totally empty. Judging from our experience, I&#39;m sure the service is probably fairly good even on busy nights. 

Overall, I&#39;d certainly go back, even if for only a glass of wine and the fondue."

And maybe that&#39;s why it was a little bit of a let down.  The space itself is really cool, with all the wine bottles covering one of the walls and I loved the high ceiling.  It just felt very open for a space that really isn&#39;t all that big.  We knew from the get go that we wanted to try the wine flights, which are $3 off during Happy Hour.  Score!  I went with the &#34;Italian Stallion&#34; flight and felt like it was just okay.  None of the wines really wowed me and the first one in particular was pretty bland.  Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had such a tasteless red wine before.

Another thing I wasn&#39;t really wowed by was the service.  Our waiter explained that it was Happy Hour but I had to ask for the food menu, which I had seen online, otherwise I&#39;m fairly certain he wasn&#39;t going to tell us about it.  It took a while for him to come around to actually take our dinner order, which was making me antsy because we were headed to The Buell afterwards, but he eventually wandered over.  He didn&#39;t do anything major, I just felt like he wasn&#39;t overly friendly or exciting.  

As for the food, the potstickers were okay and the goat cheese beignets weren&#39;t exactly beignets if you ask me, but you can&#39;t go wrong with anything that&#39;s stuffed with goat cheese.  All three of us ordered pizzas and though they seemed to take a while to come out, we were happy with our choices.  I got the Cru Steak pizza and though I thought the steak had great flavor, I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the chewy tendon I kept biting into.  Overall, I wouldn&#39;t mind Cru if I wanted to grab a glass of wine and fondue or a cheese plate but I think there&#39;s much better places to eat on Larimer that I probably wouldn&#39;t seek this place out again."

The food was excellent, staff was pleasant and helpful, and the atmosphere was romantic. We each ordered off of the Valentine&#39;s menu. The lobster bisque was delicious, followed by a nice filet mignon. The steak was cooked to order and was very flavorful! We accompanied the meal with a flight of wine apiece. The wines complimented eachother well and we were offered tasters to accompany our meal choices, on the house! The only downside was the check.

We did not order full size entrees but we certainly ate enough and it turned out to be cheaper this way. My colleague and I order a charcuterie board for 2 and it was delicious. It included foie gras that was actually tasty (I was not expecting this). We also ordered the Fig &amp; Gorgonzola bruschetta. I have never had fresher fig!

I have had the filet mignon and it is perfectly cooked each time and very tender. It comes with a side of potato fennel which is also very good. The steak has a blue cheese on top which adds so much flavor.

Having lived in California for 3 years prior to moving back to this great state, I have developed a thirsty palate for good wine.  The selection here is quite nice and the food was created for paring opportunities.

I did the spicy wine flight, which was less bold than what I was used to in California, but nonetheless enjoyable. With my spicy red flight, I had the Cru steak pizza, which was a delicious balance of flavor.  The rich, meaty tenderloin coupled with the acidic and refreshing greens and punctuated with crumbles of blue cheese.

Our waiter/sommelier was very patient and helpful waiting on us chatty Kathy&#39;s, but quickly became disinterested after we expressed our desire to not have him tell us about the wine (so that we could attempt to guess what was in them...it&#39;s a little game I play to train my palate, but also, it&#39;s fun!).

Inside the small, but spacious wine bar there are &#34;love seats&#34; nestled against the wall with wine bottles carefully covering a few of the walls. We were greeted kindly by our server who told us &#34;what they were all about&#34;. The wine flights are the perfect way to try three wines in 2 oz. portions, regardless of price. I chose the champagne and Sauvignon blanc flights-- each flight has a clever name that will make you smirk. 

Moving forward, we had the charcuterie board-- it was perfection. You&#39;re given a good amount of meats, cheese, olives with rustic bread--  a must have! 

Our ahi tartare was fresh and delicious. Stacked with juicy tuna, cucumber and avocado- I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

The Cru Steak pizza was really good, but difficult to eat due to the fact that many of the toppings aren&#39;t cooked into the pizza ( lettuce, tomato, steak). I might try a different one...

Desert was creme brûlée and the only complaint I have... Even though I don&#39;t want to have one. It took two tries to get the creme brûlée right, but it was still cold and didn&#39;t have the perfect sugar crust :( With grace and respect, the waiter took the dessert off our bill even after we ate it and didn&#39;t complain the second time. That was extremely nice.

On a sour note, our server did lack the necessary immediacy that servers should value. My boyfriend ordered a red wine, and never received it. That was disappointing since he ended up with a decaf coffee instead. Sad face.

So, I was starting high, and this review should perhaps be a bit lower based on the service and the food... but I&#39;m feeling positive. 

Five of us had dinner here before seeing a show at the Buell, which is about 3-1/2 blocks away. They made a note that we had tickets, and were sure to get our orders quickly so that we were out in time. That&#39;s about as good as the service got, though. Our server was not exactly on top of things... drinks were forgotten, an entree was forgotten, and items ended up on the wrong checks. She was, however, friendly enough. 

The food was not bad, but was definitely under seasoned. This is a tricky part of town to work in, since there are so many excellent restaurants a stone&#39;s throw away. If Cru wants to last, they&#39;re going to have to pick it up a bit. But, as things stand now, I&#39;ll be back - why?

We were informed  that they still had happy hour, of course we lost it because our server or no one else came to take care of us. We waited 20 minutes and decided to move to the bar.  We told the bartender what happened, our server noticed what happened and no one corrected anything or made anything better. Our bartender was amazing btw but we were very disappointed of our experience there. We wanted to have a great dinner but we were super turned off. Please fix the service. I have been in the industry for 15 years and this has been the worst feeling of service of them all and again they were not busy and saw we were upset."

I&#39;ve been here for a couple of happy hours now, and both times we enjoyed great wine and great service. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their wine flights, which are $3 off during happy hour. And, if you&#39;re hankering for a snack, try the goat cheese beignets small plate-- just be sure not to share it with anyone. These are so heavenly, you&#39;ll have to tell your friends to get their own order. 

Probably my favorite thing about this place is the staff. If you sit at the bar, you have a wealth of wine knowledge sitting in front of you-- your server. Strike up a conversation with them, and they&#39;ll let you know everything you&#39;ve ever wanted to know about that lovely glass of wine you&#39;re drinking, and what to drink next. They&#39;ve recommended more than a few amazing wines for me to enjoy based on my tastes--not based on what&#39;s most expensive or showy, and this is probably my favorite thing about this place. Down to earth people who love wine, love talking about wine, and want to share their love with you."

We had an amazing night - the food was delicious, we came for happy hour and enjoyed 2 flights $3 off, and then finished with a half-price bottle of champagne (Thursday night special) we spent 3 hours there sampling cheese platters, starters, a pizza (highly recommend the steak) and finished with dessert. Let me tell you, I am still dreaming about the lemon tart, probably the best thing I have ever eaten in my life, but the chocolate fondue we had with it was a pretty close second!!

We were greeted immediately and seated shortly thereafter.  The staff on duty were friendly and attentive.  The decor atmosphere is a cross between sports bar and mountain lodge.  As a Saints fan, I could have done without the Broncos labeled Tabasco (LOL).

FOOD:  The portions on the entrees we selected were HUGE.  We would definitely have taken home leftovers if we&#39;d been going home.  I ordered the Junior burrito plate with an a la carte enchilada.  That burrito was PACKED with meat and flavor.  My husband ordered the tamale plate and had to tap out before he finished the third tamale.  I loved the fact that we could choose our own heat level.  The hot was perfect for me because I like the heat while still being able to taste the flavor.  We still wanted to try the sopapilla pieces though so admittedly, we left a little room for those.  They were hot, cinnamony and delicious.

COST:  For chips/salsa, two entrees and drinks, and a dessert to share, our tab was around $35, reasonable, in my opinion, for the amount of food."

This is our go-to for dinners on weekends or if we are craving mexican delights. The 3 taco platter is my favorite as the portions are ample and the rice is delicious (it&#39;s also $7.99). My husband loves the cheese enchiladas and the house margaritas are nice and strong. We&#39;ve had breakfasts here as well and enjoy the breakfast burritos, though I recommend asking for salsa as they can be a bit dry (I don&#39;t get the chili).

We have encountered nights that are super busy in the restaurant, but you can usually find a table in the bar area. Service can be slow but they&#39;re always friendly and acknowledge how slammed they are. Prices are definitely right and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend it!"

I have tried it a few times over the years and it is just never that good. I have ordered various items and it is just sub par at best. This last time I ordered a cheese and onion enchilada and a beef enchilada with red sauce. The cheese and onion one was just a yellow cheese with white onions that were not cooked well in a tortilla. The beef enchilada was unseasoned or very under seasoned ground beef in a tortilla. Both covered in a bland red/ brown sauce. My child ordered a Oreo shake that was more milk than ice cream.
No one at the table particularly loved their food. It was edible but was not great. Brought mine home not wanting to waste it and 2 other members of my family would not eat it either. 
I think the Rock is popular because of their location, service and food are very lacking. I wish they would step up their game because I would love to enjoy a good dinner on their outdoor patio looking at the mountains."

We decided on The Rock.  I had never been here before so something new was welcome in my eyes.  

It&#39;s a funky little place in my eyes.  You walk in and can go to the bar, or into a quieter area for dining/ drinking in larger groups.  There happened to be a larger birthday type party happening in the dining area which made the 4 male companions I had VERY happy.   Chicks in short skirts is apparently the cure for staring at numbers for hours.  

We were presented with a menu and the specials menu.  It&#39;s their 10th anniversary so every week they have specials and charge the prices from 2003.  They have about 10 different ones a week for the next few weeks.  Pretty neat and Very Affordable.  They do show you the current prices so you can see the difference.  

A variety of orders were placed, someone had a shrimp dinner, that came complete with a baked potato, salad and veggies.  Another was a Taco Platter , some onion rings and last but not least the Caramel Apple Chimichunga with Iced Cream.   Can ya guess what I had?  Well, it was actually to share amongst all of us.  The shrimp dinner was definitely ample.  Tons of veggies and the shrimp was decently breaded and fried.  The Onion Rings were not greasy but could have used a little more salt, but that&#39;s a personal taste thing and with salt on the table not an issue.  We could not get out of Buddy how the Taco&#39;s were cause he just kept eating.  I am assuming by the lack of negative reaction they were pretty good.  

Now on to the Chimi.  Good Lord that thing was good.  Apple pie type filling wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried, covered in Caramel and dusted with Cinnamon served with a cinnamon vanilla iced cream.  I think I had a sugar spike when they sat it down on the table with us.  This is definitely a desert to be shared with a few people.  It&#39;s just too good not to.  The apples were not mush, they were still a bit firm in the filling.  This I personally prefer.  The iced cream was good, but a bit over powered by the massive amount to caramel.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I like caramel, it was just a bit too generous with it.   James had threatened to lick the plate once we were all done, but we didn&#39;t take him up on the offer.  

A fun relaxed post late office night was enjoyed by all.  I am thinking we will spend more Friday nights after work here in the future."

She literally came out screaming that we shouldnt be eating there if we cant afford the food. And that we were assholes for leaving her change.
I paid for what I ate, and if you think that i should have left her more, tell me what good server would scream at their clients? And call them names?

Not all but most of the girls on the bar side act like they&#39;re doing you a favor by serving you. I try to go out of my way to be extra nice, hoping it rubs off, but nope - not happening.

For the food i&#39;d give it two stars, but my family just had an experience there that made me sick. We sat down and ordered our food, and after waiting a longer time than usual, our food finally came. This was when the experience totally went downhill. My cousin, who is only 11 years old, asked the waiter if he could have a plastic cup for ketchup. He responds to this request by taking the ketchup bottle at the table, slamming it down in front of him, and him saying &#34;is this good enough?&#34; Of course, my uncle didn&#39;t take kindly to his son being mistreated. When we finally got our check, he asked the waitress who gave it to us for his name. Long story short, she said that he is the owners son and that he isn&#39;t very good at his job. (Which somehow happens to be the assistant manager) My uncle asked her to bring it up with the owners and we left. As we were outside saying goodbye, the assistant manager comes out side and asks my uncle &#34;was everything good?&#34; with a smug smile on his face. My uncle responded by saying he didn&#39;t appreciate the way he and his son were being treated, and that he wasn&#39;t a very good manager. He then responds by denying it, even though everybody at our table witnessed it. He says that it&#39;s a family business and he would never do that, but that just goes to show he&#39;s getting special treatment because he&#39;s the owner&#39;s son. He then walks back inside, still denying he did anything wrong. The icing on the cake, however, was when my uncle asked one of the bartenders what his name was, she left him without saying anything and started talking to none other than the assistant manager. I seems everybody is quick to defend him. I&#39;m sure the restaurant knew this review was coming, so if you&#39;re reading this: please fire the assistant manager or you have lost loyal customers since the place opened.

TL;DR: The assistant manager is incredibly rude and likes to be mean to 11 year olds, the staff is in on it, presumably because he&#39;s the owner&#39;s son, and the waitresses love to gossip. Do not come here!"

I know, I know, what does that mean?  It means it is a hop, skip and a jump from my house and it is a non-chain restaurant in suburbia - I want to like it!  The thing is, I like the bar, however I have come to the realization I don&#39;t like the restaurant.  

They actually have two doors: one to the restaurant and one to the bar.  When we eat on the restaurant side something inevitably goes wrong (wrong food, wrong bill, they don&#39;t give us happy hour prices - something).  Plus service on the this side is spotty as far as coming back for refills or checking on us during the meal.  Not to mention, I am never totally in love with whatever I order (too greasy, too plain, too something!). 

Now the bar is a totally different story. I have never had a problem with service - it is great! I always get billed correctly and it is a nice vibe (not to mention I have come in at 3p on a Tuesday and it has been almost full!).  Maybe it is because if I come to the bar I am usually just going for apps and beer and its pretty hard to mess up!  I don&#39;t know, its just better in the bar :) 

So The Rock the Bar is great.  The Rock the Restaurant....not so much."

The service was okay as well. Though she was a long time between when we sat down and when we ordered.  The girls that work there are young, and I can&#39;t believe the short shorts they wear.

The service was good and quick. Prices were not bad at all. We went during happy hour and I think my vodka tonics were only $3 each and entrees were only $10.

The food was just OK. I got the enchiladas and it was a huge plate. The enchilada sauce tasted kind of bland but overall it was all right. We also got the chips and queso and the queso was super yummy.

Yet, we always seem to end up there. (I know it is because they are the only thing around that is not a stupid chain restaurant.)

However, the Rock does have a few good things going for them. One, they seem to only hire young cute girls which my husband enjoys (I&#39;m sure). Two they have an awesome patio and good happy hour. 

Aside from that the food is not good eats. Greasy, frozen, and over processed. Moreover, it really get&#39;s my goat when &#34;traditional American joints&#34; you know the ones that should be serving really awesome hamburgers and fries attempt to make green chili and other Mexican dishes.

So let&#39;s get clear not every restaurant in Colorado needs to serve green chilli. And if they insist on serving green chilli then please take time to learn how to make it! Really learn, like take a class or something. Otherwise stick to what you know and cook good American eats.

In closing, if you find yourself at the Rock and don&#39;t know how you ended up there again....it&#39;s best to just sit on the wonderful patio (make sure your husband has view of the pretty girls) and enjoy a happy hour cocktail."

As a girl who enjoys going to bars I can say I have noticed that often attractive bartenders and waitresses can be a little bitchy to girls that come in. Lets face it unlike the drooling guys I am not going to give them big tips because they are hot. The girls here are smart and while very hot they are also sweet and do a good job. 

I got a rockarita, they only let you have two and its a good idea because they are big and yummy and full of liquor.

When they passed the law to ban smoking in certain establishments (like restaurants), we finally decided to give this place a shot.

It&#39;s been almost two years since we moved (back home to Hawaii), and while I don&#39;t remember what we got everytime we went, I do remember the highlights.  My husband had the mexican steak sandwich a few times and both he and I agree that it&#39;s delish.  I&#39;m not super knowledgeable about green chili, but I do like the stuff they have at The Rock.  You get to pick from mild, hot and extra hot.  I&#39;ve only tried the hot and extra hot and they&#39;re both awesome (the extra hot is my favorite).  They also have really good potato skins.  They&#39;re almost like half baked potatos (woohoo) if you ask me and they give a few interesting toppings to choose from.  We usually went with cheese, bacon and mushrooms and would get a side of some sour cream and salsa to dip it in.  They&#39;re breakfast was pretty good from what I remember and they also have really good soup.  I&#39;ve tried the clam chowder, baked potato and minestrone and they&#39;re all great.

Now that we&#39;re back in Hawaii, we actually have cravings for this place (especially the green chili) and we&#39;re both a little sad we didn&#39;t start eating here earlier.

Sad that it&#39;s marred by the billions of homes that have recently been built and is quickly eroding the view ( and, who&#39;s buying all these homes???) but I digress..... 

Yes, the other reviewers are absolutely correct. 
The Rock has absolutely inedible food....the only people who feel otherwise are vodka soaked, and the don&#39;t care what they put into their food hole. 
The burgers are frozen, straight from Costco....you know those paper thin grizzle burgers that you serve at your 5 year old&#39;s BD party, and the Tex-Mex looks like what you give to Rover. 
However the fries are good, and the sliced steak sandwich is passable, in a pinch. 

Oh, but that view !!!!!

the servers are mostly rude. One of them just threw the plates on the table
and walked away. It seems they have high turnover. The manager we talked to us
earlier this week was a total waste of time.

We had a Get a Waffle free coupon. we got separate checks. the manager said
we cant a accept 2 of them (1 per customer) got the check and I was charged 3.00 for a 
waffle that was supposed to be free.

Will NOT go back this place.  but IHOP is worse. We will go to parker 
waffle house (way out of our way) to AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!
it seems in the 8 years we have went there we will go somewhere else
Denver and Aurora both have places that are way nicer. This locationi
should be called Ghetto House........ again. BAD Manager, bad service!"

Over time, the servers are mostly rude. One of them (Christine) barely talked, acted like it was a bother to wait on us. When the food did come, she just slid the plates on the table, forgot the flatware, and then walked away. It seems they have high turnover. 

Earlier this week, we both had a Get a Waffle free coupon (We are both in their email program.I know they cannot accept to coupons on one check, so we got separate checks. The manager (Hannah, a really rude, bitchy manager) said they couldn&#39;t accept two coupons.
We explained that we were on separate checks and each had a coupon. She restated, they can&#39;t accept 2 of them (1 per customer). I guess since we were sitting together, it didn&#39;t matter that we had separate checks. We have never had a problem each using one before. When Brian got his check he was charged 3.65 for a waffle that was supposed to be free. Even though mine was free, I was charged tax on it. I didn&#39;t realize it was legal to charge tax on a free item.

We will NOT go back this location. We will go to the Parker waffle house (way out of our way) to AVOID THIS PLACE! There was a regional or district manager (according to a server) there that day and he wouldn&#39;t even talk to us. With senior management like this, it&#39;s no wonder, they have inferior management at the restaurant level. If I didn&#39;t like the food, and didn&#39;t get the coupons, I would never go back and they don&#39;t really seem to care about losing a customer.

I have filed a complaint with the corporate office and asked for a response, so it will be interesting to see what they say, if they even respond. They also have the juke box cranked up to a level that could compete with a noisy bar. You almost have to shout to hear each other talk, When assked about it they just shrugged and said that&#39;s how it is."

They are so friendly and keep you laughing and having a good fun time at work. They work together so well and make great food at the sane time. I noticed there are regulars there that will only eat if specific cooks make their food which shows loyalty. They could eat anywhere else but the come there daily.  That in itself speaks loudly about how good the food us and the customer service.

My GF and I went to waffle house on 2/27/2016 around noon.  It wasn&#39;t crowded and seem kinda in chaos.  So we gave it a shot.  Back home, Waffle House was the place to go in my old neighborhood.  

The waitress was an older lady with glasses.  She was very reluctant to let us sit at the 1st open table with nobody else waiting.  We asked for OJ, but they were out.  So we asked for Lemonade.  When I got my Lemonade, there was blood all over the side of my plastic cup.  A lot of blood.  She looked right at us &amp; said, &#34;Oh my gosh, how did that get there!&#34;  She never washed her hands or put on a band aid.  She then brought my GF&#39;s coffee.  I said, &#34;Don&#39;t touch it, let&#39;s go now.&#34;  We were there a total of 15 minutes.

I don&#39;t care how you would have handle it, but please be professional when it comes to BLOOD.  I saw her hand, it was bloody and gross.  We also left her $2.00 because she certainly needed it.  Don&#39;t go to the Waffle House on East Mississippi Ave in Aurora by I-225.  Go a block down to IHOP.

Please think about your customers and blood borne pathogens.  I see that this place has a lot of positive reviews.  Because it was blood related, I had to comment on here &amp; warn others."

With doubt the vicious circle

This Waffle House is as good as any other that I&#39;ve been to.  My go to staple for breakfast is their pecan waffle, a side of sausage and coffee.

So we pulled into this Waffle House a little after 6:30am on a Monday, after having been on the road for 3 hours. 

Two of my buddies had been to a Waffle House and knew what they wanted. I milled around for a while looking at the options (they are pretty basic).

I followed the order of my friend who got the Hash-browns &#34;all over&#34;. This is a big plate of hash-browns, with peppers, onions, mushroom, bits of ham, all mixed in. 
I didn&#39;t know what came with it until i got it. After being up for a few hours and hungry this was on the money! 

They&#39;ll bring you a big bowl of Chili and gravy for the table, and if you choose, you can take globs of either or both and throw it on top of the big plate of crispy golden brown hash-browns. 

If you order the hash-browns and a side of biscuits and gravy, you won&#39;t finish them. 

The place is open all night, its cheap, clean, and pretty plain, but if you are hungry and near one of these places, go in get the hash-browns. 

This meal hit the spot at the end of a very long weekend.  Wish we had one close to me, but then again, maybe it better this way, I can&#39;t eat like that all the time."

I usually go here late at night when I am done with work and craving some grits and hash browns. The staff has ALWAYS been super attentive and smiling, greeting us at the door and quick to get us a beverage. The cooks seem to be well trained or just give a care about what they put on  a plate, either way I can never complain and that&#39;s rare at any joint. 

I have never heard the staff have loud conversations about personal matters and even witnessed 2 staffers agreeing the back was the best place to hold a personal conversation, communicate to the other staff member that they were leaving the floor for a moment and proceed to do so. I can&#39;t even get MY STAFF to do that and they get stocks, full medical/dental/vision, and raises every 6 months. 

I have been to the WaHo over on Peoria and they all seem ready to slit their wrists in the back sink. Food is always iffy and...well, it&#39;s the opposite of this WaHo. if this place were a tad closer to where I live I would likely eat there at least once a week. 

5th star will manifest when WaHo carries boiled peanuts. I need them and you can&#39;t have perfect grits at a place this far west without boiled peanuts. #dreaming"

A trucker&#39;s paradise, the Waffle House is one of those joints which realizes its not about making good food when your customers will probably be forced to eat here anyway (due to the fact that it is uber-late), but instead it is about making the cheapest food possible that is still edible. 

Greasy, over-priced, and coffee weak or way too strong. If you try to get something else than the standard eggs and bacon, you better avoid the salad....this was uh..an experience that&#39;s for sure.

The food is fresh and has great flavors. The best part is that the leadership of the company has clearly gone the extra mile for training the staff of food safety. 

As a person with celiac, going out can be very risky. I can be affected by someone touching non-gluten free food then touching mine. Unfortunately, I&#39;m that sensitive. 

At Garbanzos, as soon as I ask for the gluten free pita the staff stops politely ask why. As soon as I say celiac, they stop, take off their gloves, wash hands, and start fresh. As we go down the line, they pull the food from under the line so it has not touched any other food that could contaminate it. They will even cook me fresh chicken if needed. I am certain this whole process can slow them down, but they have never acted like the were put out by the extra work. I have never had to ask for this, it&#39;s what they do. 

Thank you Garbanzos for having food I can eat. And thank you more for training your staff of food safety. Many, many other companies should learn from you!"

The bad- either I happen to come on the days that someone doesn&#39;t feel like fully cooking the rice, or they just don&#39;t care how they cook the rice ever. It&#39;s soft on the outside and crunchy on the inside , yuck.

One thing that makes them stand out is the customization of the items you add to your entree.

There was no line up and so my visit was nice and quick. The staff at this location are very friendly and efficient and so they definitely add to your visit.

I love the chicken plate as they nicely pile all of the options around a large plate and you can then mix and match what you want on your pita that is served on the side. The marinated red cabbage and spicy pickles are my absolute favourite things offered. My plate could consist purely of those and I would be stoked. The vegetable options are always fresh and I appreciate that they put a sparse amount of sauce over everything at the end.

Only downsides I&#39;ve come across are the texture of the baba ganoush and sometimes the items are quite salty (chicken primarily). The baba ganoush has a nice savoury taste to it but has the texture of mashed bananas. I had to fight through that one.

Even though I see these places all over, my first visit to a Garbanzo&#39;s was just recently. It&#39;s too bad because this fast-casual chain has a lot of great things going for it. 

This place has all the pseudo-Medeteranean greats like hummus, falafel, schwarma, gyros, tabouleh, etc. but done cafeteria style so you can get exactly the things you want. They even have a really good selection of flavorful iced teas that you can drink instead of soda.

The first time I went I thought it was good but I wasn&#39;t hooked. This (much like chipotle) is the type of place where you have to figure out the combination that works best for you. At first the selections can be a little intimidating if you aren&#39;t familiar with Mediterranean food. I am not a big rice fan but theirs is really good. I didn&#39;t truly love this place until I started getting the plate. When they make it in the pita everything is layered in so you end up only getting one or two items in a bite. If you get the plate you can mix everything together how you like it and then load up your own pita. Plus you get more stuff that way and can take some home for an awesome midnight snack.

Do not go to Garbanzo&#39;s looking for the greatest Middle Eastern food you have ever tasted.  Go in because you want healthy faster food options at a reasonable price, and there are no other Middle Eastern restaurants around you.  As a tip, they will give you as much of the side dishes as you like at Garbanzo&#39;s, so if you want more humus, just ask them.

I&#39;ve been to the one on Arapahoe several times for lunch and its always packed.  I knew that this one wouldn&#39;t be quite as packed so my big question was...Would i still get a free Falafal sample before I order?  Well, the answer is YES!  The staff here is just as fast, friendly and courteous as they are at the Arapahoe location which is awesome.

The place is brand new so of course it was clean and I would expect nothing less from the folks at GMG.  The food was great and the guy making my order even let me try the pickled eggplant which I thought were peppers of some sort.  When I said that he told me, &#34;Actually that&#39;s pickled eggplant, It&#39;s really good.  you want to try it?&#34;  So I got a sample before I committed to piling it on my plate.

Every time I&#39;ve been to GMG, they do a good job of asking what extras you want.  They could list things a little slower when they are asking what you want but I know they are used to it and just jam thru the list.

Falafels were over cooked and so dry.  Pita bread was cold and dry.  Yellow rice was over cooked and too mushy.  When I entered the restaurant, there was only one customer ahead of me.  I stood by the order location for almost 5 minutes and nobody greeted me even though there was a guy who was standing right by and he looked at me but did not say anything.  This guy was too busy cooking falafels and could not even say &#34;hi&#34;.  When I was eating at the restaurant, I spotted one worker trying to transfer sauce to a container and she accidentally spilled some on the counter.  Then, she placed her cleaning bucket right on the serving counter, squeezing the rug in the bucket right in front of the food!  It looked pretty dirty and disgusting.  I  have been to south Colorado location of Garbanzo several times and that place is so much better.  The staffs are very friendly and food quality is much higher.

I ordered the Benedict which was served with country style potatoes and a couple slices of avocado. It was a great Benedict--the yolk was soft, the ham was thick and flavorful, and the hollandaise was good (not the best sauce I&#39;ve had, but also very satisfying). I would say that I have a hearty appetite, but I was only able to finish one face of the Benedict. 

The real star for me, though, were the little muffins served before the meal. I may or may not have eaten six. Seriously, can I buy those to bring home?! Very good meal, all in all."

We still come here often, and Luke, the bartender is a sweetheart. We love the owners and the staff. The food is amazing. While we usually just head to the bar and dine off of the happy hour menu, Wednesday nights we will come for prime rib night and do a split plate (their prime rib is done perfectly every time). Chainbreaker and Man Beer always on tap now, and I have to say, the bartenders know how to make a good martini as well. We&#39;ve also made it in one Saturday for their pig roast - delicious!

Their HH is daily from 5-10pm. I recommend the lamb lollipops (you get 3, sometimes they are huge, sometimes they are tiny, but they are so flavorful). 

And a recent addition to their dessert menu (well it&#39;s been around for about 6 months) is their baklava. Drizzled with honey and served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Perfect end to a perfect meal of delicious food, delicious drinks and great service.

It seems like it has an older crowd, mostly locals. My #2 favorite neighborhood haunt."

There is ample parking and the exterior is unassuming. They have a upscale interior with fun red phone booth in the lobby.

We had made a reservation and were seated at a large booth (my favorite place to sit always).

They were offering restaurant week (February 26-March 6) which is a great way to try several dishes for only $30.

One of the highlights of the meal was our server Kelly. He was friendly, attentive and refilled drinks throughout the meal. He was understanding when it took us a while to make decisions as we were busy catching up with our friends. Definitely a great asset to Citron.

We all opted for restaurant week, which is 4 different courses there. 

For the first course I tried the spicy hummus with pita, feta, red pepper, evoo &amp; Kalamata olive. It was definitely spicy but not overly so. My wife tried the piquilo peppers stuffed with pork with balsamic reduction. They were also tasty and came with toasted bread squares. 

The salad course was my least favorite. I should have gone with the wedge (my wife did), which came with pancetta, blue cheese dressing, toasted almonds, and iceberg lettuce. The Greek salad was a bit overdressed in dressing and was just pieces of cucumber, tomatoes, onions and one kalamata olive. 

The main course offered five choices. We had the grilled chicken with caper berries (large &amp; plentiful), wild rice, grilled vegetables and a lemon sauce. It was a bit salty but very delicious. The chicken had a nice char to it. My wife had the avocado stacked enchiladas with artichoke hearts, spinach, cheese and a spicy Verde sauce. It came with white rice on the side. 

For dessert we both had the chocolate souffle which was delicious.

Overall a great meal and somewhere I look forward to dining at again."

On the plus side, we got a small section of the restaurant to ourselves. On the down side, the person who told us to &#34;just go all the way to the back&#34; apparently thought we were some other group entirely. Don&#39;t know if that group got their table or not.

The food was decent, but nothing special, and the $3.50 side of sausage with my french toast was 1 sausage link. My youngest nephew was served pancakes on a plate too hot to touch. My sister had to ask multiple times for the table to be wiped down (why that wasn&#39;t done before it was re-set, I&#39;ll never know). I had tea, and my brother in law had coffee. We managed to get refills as the plates were being cleared. Actually, we got entirely new mugs, not refills. 

Average to over-priced food, and significantly less than average service. If every place else you want to go has a long waiting list, maybe this is your place. But not before then."

They have small plates and burgers for great prices, around $5, also good drink specials, also about $5 for some cool cocktails.

The other night we sat in the dining area for a change. Missed out on happy hour deals but wanted to sit in a booth. I find it a little odd that this restaurant is so divided, totally different ambiance, drink menu, and food menu. The orange mojito  ($7) here is so good! We ordered the chicken taco appetizer. These are taquitos, not tacos. They were good, it was a small amount of food though. My boyfriend ordered a ahi tuna burger which was epic!

I was by myself and basically got treated like I should have gone around to the back door. I ordered the beef tenders salad. I love their bread and olive oil dip. In fact, that&#39;s mainly what I went there for. Instead, what I got was stale bread sticks. The beef slices in the salad were plentiful but stone-cold and tasted like they had been hanging around in the fridge too long. The waitress did get friendlier toward the end of my meal. I guess she was afraid she wouldn&#39;t get a tip. I didn&#39;t complain about the bad experience, but I probably should have. 

Now I&#39;m supposed to be meeting a friend there for dinner tonight. Yikes! I hope the experience is better than my lunch was. On the plus side (when I&#39;ve been there with other people in the past), we&#39;ve always gotten fresh bread and good service, and I&#39;ve had prime rib there a couple of times that was pretty decent.

Maybe they were just having a bad day when I had lunch there by myself. But on the other hand, maybe Citron Bistro just doesn&#39;t like parties of one taking up space at their tables. I guess it doesn&#39;t occur to them that we don&#39;t always eat alone, and that if we are treated right we just might come back with our friends and families."

Their dining area is always clean (not lots of dirty table waiting to be cleaned) with booth or table options, both comfortable, roomy, and spaced properly so your not right on top of another guest. They have a great bar if your looking for something a little more energetic, wonderful happy hour specials. In the winter we love to sit at the fireplace. This area is kind of an extension of the bar so it&#39;s a good option if you are looking to have a full meal, but want something more casual than the dining room. Their patio doesn&#39;t have the best view, but they&#39;ve installed a fountain and have beautiful flowers in the summer; great for brunch. Big umbrellas and an overhang in sitting in the sun isn&#39;t you thing (that&#39;s me).

It was a last minute reservation and we were thankful that we were able to find a table...as well as a bit concerned since Easter was only two days away.

Food was plentiful, but nothing amazing. Honestly, most of the fare seemed like items available at a casual buffet like Golden Corral. So at $34.95 per person, non-alcoholic beverages NOT included, it seemed a bit over priced. And the tip jar at the omelet station was a bit off-putting. Our server was friendly and made sure our beverages were refilled and sitting on the patio was nice, even though the view was of Hampden.

I ordered the &#34;beef tender with eggs Napoleon&#34; and received the dish without any beef in sight. I started eating it thinking that it must be below the eggs, hollandaise, and potatoes. However, as I got further into the dish, it became clearer that whoever prepared the dish did not include beef, so I brought it up with the waiter when he brought my check. As I was in a hurry, I didn&#39;t really have time to argue with anyone. I just wanted to be charged for the meal less the cost of the beef and any further discount that I may have been extended because of the poor service. However, the waiter said he did not have the authority to change my bill and the cook claimed that I was lying about the beef. In the end, I just paid the bill and left. It&#39;s a shame that the service here was so poor because I would probably be dining here on a regular basis."

I do not enjoy oriental food so I need thought to inquire within. Ended up dining there with a close friend for Easter brunch. We are both industry workers (chefs to be exact) but weren&#39;t  interested in picking apart the buffet, we just wanted to enjoy the holiday from the other side of the counter for once. First time for both of us in the establishment and we were both impressed with the facade of the facility. We arrived early for our reservation but were immediately seated regardless, ordered a couple of mimosas, and hit the buffet right away. Buffet was well stocked, carving station impressive (complete with lamb roast) and virtually no complaints on the quality of the product. Once we passed through the buffet we returned to our table to find one of our beverages upright yet empty with remnants of said mimosa, after a long pause due to confusion a different server approached our table. He then informed us that the server who sat us was an alcoholic who needed to check into a rehabilitation center and in fact was actually no longer employed at the facility, however stepped in to help out on the busy Sunday. This information was saddening but not necessary to share with guests. We understand that the industry has it&#39;s quirks so went about our dining experience, only to have yet another server approach the table to inform us that server number 1 had to leave due to a family emergency (she did not know that her coworker had already spilled the beans on the details of the incident). The staff was clearly embarassed, understandably so, and therefore both servers 2 and 3 each touched our table about 10 times throughout our hour and a half dining experience. I respect and expect table touching but it becomes a bother after a certain point. When our bill arrived, we were only charged for the 2 buffet trips and one round of drinks, very kindly. Before our departure, server number 3 informed us that the owner&#39;s daughter was in the house and was responsible for preparing a majority of the pastries (great personable selling point). However, being in the industry we are in, we both had experience ordering a majority of the desserts on the buffet from Sysco foods as well as other vendors (the branded cake boards spoke for themselves) and therefore knew this to be mostly untrue. I appreciate the effort the staff made in an attempt to cover up a very embarrassing incident, but sometimes it pays to be honest and/or keep certain personal information out of the reach of patrons."

The service was great, but the shrimp tostado that my friend ordered was uneatable. Really. All three of us tried the shrimp to confirm none of us could eat it. I wanted to send it back or just ask someone who worked there to take a bite to see his/her reaction. So sad, because it LOOKED great. 
  I had the ahi tuna sandwich and it also wasn&#39;t good. I don&#39;t often have tuna, so I have nothing with which to compare. 
  We won&#39;t be returning there, which is a bummer because there aren&#39;t many restaurant choices in that area of town."

We walked in and immediately I was panicked. It was 5:30pm and this place was almost completely empty, there was one table with 2 people at it... and us. This should have been clue #1. The interior looks like an old, run-down Denny&#39;s or something. The bread plate was chipped and sharp, and the napkins were dated, all of this should have said &#34;run&#34; to me, but I ignored that and just waited for the great food I knew would be coming. 

I ordered the chicken fried chicken with no broccoli. It came out, with broccoli, now our waiter smelled like he might have a second job at a dispensary (or he had just taken a little &#34;smoke&#34; break) so maybe he forgot that I had made this request. The broccoli wasn&#39;t drained at all and juice was running all over my plate. Despite all of this, the chicken looked really great, I could see that it was dipped in house. I took a bite, hoping for the very best, and it just didn&#39;t work out. The chicken had that sort of squeaky, &#34;I&#39;ve been frozen for a while&#34; kind of feeling in my mouth. The potatoes may have been from a box, but they were decent either way. I didn&#39;t eat, sent my food back and left. 

Not a great experience, and certainly not one I would recommend to anyone else."

So the service was amazing our waiter was extremely attentive and helpful explaining the menu since this was our first time here.  We ordered the avocado fries for an appetizer and they were delicious yes they were deep-fried but the coating was very light and crisp the dipping sauce was a little spicy but not too much, overall they were really good. Bread comes before every dinner - it&#39;s warm and amazing - the olive oil has a heap of crushed olives piled in the middle. It was so good I was almost didn&#39;t have room to eat my entrée which was the Mediterranean pasta topped with fresh grilled salmon - again this was amazing the salmon was cooked perfectly and still sizzling hot when it reached my table. Even though my daughter and I were both stuffed we did end up getting the cheesecake for dessert - next time I think I should start with the cheesecake and get two of them (they are small slices, but by the time you get to desert you&#39;re so full you don&#39;t really care.

Cares about money, not about his customer.  It&#39;s too bad because I think the happy hour here was decent but I would never pay another penny towards his pocket.

This restaurant is a little out of the way, next to a cemetery, down the street from the Whole Foods on Hampden.  It&#39;s actually really easy to get to, but it&#39;s off the beaten path.  I actually made reservations - don&#39;t know what I was thinking, since it was really easy to get in - quiet, even.  The place is your average bar + restaurant, with a little patio (although not much to look at when you are on the patio).

We started with drinks - they serve the usual assortment plus a reasonable selection of wine and beer, including wine by the glass.  We opted for something we don&#39;t see everywhere - ginger beer.  Made by Golden, this ginger beer is completely clear, has a nice ginger bite and is very refreshing.

As is normal, we got a bread basket - a nice collection of warm whole wheat bread - tasty.  It came with a mix of olive oil and some sort of anchovy-based tapenade (at least that is what it tasted like).

Our soup course was a roasted red pepper soup with shrimp.  A warning here - the soup is a fish soup - it tastes way more fishy than the name suggests.  I liked it - my wife thought it too fishy.  The bread goes particularly well with this soup though.  The crackers didn&#39;t make it out of the bag on this one.

I ordered the Tilapia special - which needs a tweak.  First, the bad thing - the fish.  It was seriously overcooked, to the point of dryness.  I didn&#39;t enjoy this at all.  The good part was the rest of the dish.  They had a spicy red chili sauce and a black bean puree doing a ying nd yang thing on the plate, with a polenta cake to soak it all up and some nicely cooked asparagus for a garnish.  

My wife ordered the beef tenderloin gyros, which came with fries.  I&#39;m not sure why restaurants are dipping their fries in batter these days, but I don&#39;t like it.  These were better than most, but still disappointing.  What wasn&#39;t disappointing was the gyro - the tenderloin was excellent and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing.

Overall, a keeper, but I need to try some more stuff here."

After a friend had bragged about their Creme Brule nepolean I decide to take him to  DRW with me. For an appetizer we got the Mushroom strudel and craw fish po boys. Both just simply davine. For our entrees we got this pasta in a to die for cream sauce with shrimp, lobster, muscles crab claws. It was very rich, but I couldn&#39;t stop eating it, I had to stop and rest and would not let the staff take my plate until every last morsel was gone. We also got the duck breast with Cumberland pomegranate sauce with extra fried duck skin. It was very flavorful and very hard to stop eating. We still had dessert coming with bread pudding and white chocolate pistachio ice cream. So yummy just not enough room for it all. Then we also had the creme brule Napoleon. It is defiantly the best creme brule I&#39;ve had. I cant wait to go back.

I have to say our waiter was pretty amazing. Very attentive, friendly and social. I just like the all around vibe of this establishment."

Great place to meet friends for a drink and appetizers or stay for dinner and wine. Although the building is very unassuming from the outside, once you enter the atmosphere is more like something you would find at the trendy bistros downtown and that is refreshing in an area that is lacking any &#34;cool&#34; places to eat. The menu has mexican/american flare and the prices are very reasonable. Add that to the cozy and trendy atmosphere and great customer service and you have a little hidden gem. Be sure to try the fried avocado...Yum!"

The restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded, but it took several minutes for the host to greet and seat us and several more minutes to catch the attention of our server.  As we waited for service, the decor really caught my eye.  Citron has done a great job with renovating the old Marie Callendar&#39;s building to a modern and classy restaurant that seems to appeal to a business crowd.  

I ordered the lunch special which was New England clam chowder and calamari sliders.  The chowder was just how I like it -- thick and creamy.  Unfortunately, it  tasted like Campbell&#39;s canned chowder versus homemade.   The fried calamari sliders were a disappointment.  They were bland and even the fresh aioli couldn&#39;t save them.  

All-in-all, Citron may be a good place for business lunches.  They offer a nice space with interesting lunch specials.  I think they just need a little more practice developing their flavors."

I decided to check it out myself since I was close by and hungry. Ambiance was good, staff was polite. Ordered the Tequila chicken and Sea bass for our entrée. Tequila chicken was great. Sea Bass was horrible, seemed like the fish was taken out of the freezer and dropped on the pan, the outside was cooked and the inside was stuck together like rubber. I am not a fussy eater, but that dish killed my appetite and almost made me throw up. Our waiter did apologize and offered to take it off the bill and give us desert on the house.  The manager/owner who sat us, never once came by to check or apologize for it. 
3 stars for the polite staff, ambiance and the chicken. But you are not going to drag me back there."

While I stand by my earlier review about the dinner that we had, the Mother&#39;s Day brunch SUCKED!!!  I would never eat brunch here again.

For $33/adult and $14/10-years and under (thus, the 12-year old with us that ate three pieces of bacon and some eggs cost us $33), I expect some really special and delicious food.  The food was just so-so and comparable could be had at half the price elsewhere.  What I do not expect, is to be charged extra for cups of coffee and OJ.  You read that right, coffee and orange juice were extra.  Are you fucking kidding me?  No complimentary mimosas for mothers?  Really?  No flower for Mothers?  Sad!

Overall, I was responsible for a party of 11 trying Citron for Mother&#39;s Day Brunch.  I feel embarrassed and insulted by Citron.  I shan&#39;t make that mistake again, and you would be foolish to do so, too, knowing what I just told you.  Stay away from Citron Bistro for brunch!

We sat in the bar area as it was too windy to enjoy the patio but definitely will be an option next time.  Happy hour pricing is excellent for both food and drinks; 5 of us totaled under $60 with a couple of appetizers as well as everyone&#39;s food and drinks!

Was fairly busy but our waiter was as attentive as we needed him to be and food was fresh, yet extremely fast.  Several had the burgers which were juicy and decent.  Seasoned fries were excellent.  The spicy hummus was spicy for some and bland for others and comes with pita bread.  Chips were overly seasoned with a southwestern seasoning but the flavor was still okay; however, the accompanying salsa was bland for my taste. By the time we left it was pretty packed in the bar, however the restaurant side wasn&#39;t busy.  Happy hour pricing is only available in the bar and patio areas so know that before you choose where to sit!

Personal pizzas for $5 and a large assortment of small plates for even less than that?! No arguments here!! Specialty cocktails are $5 also, and the Moscow Mule(s) were delicious. The service was not great - come to think of it, I can&#39;t even remember if we had a man or a woman helping us out. It wasn&#39;t terrible, just incredibly un-memorable. Oh well.

The ambiance was really good and classy.

The server was really good and she kept coming back and asking everyone for drinks. No one was on time so she had to come back after each person walked in. She was really sweet.

It is located in a space previously occupied by Marie Callender&#39;s near the intersection of Yosemite &amp; Hampden.  The restaurant&#39;s interior has been completely updated and has a fashionable contemporary decor with a stylish supper club ambience.

The food is exceptional.  We had the Cioppino &amp; Seabass and finished with their house specialty dessert, Crème Brûlée Napoleon, and everything was outstanding!

Service was good.  We sat outside - they have a lovely outside patio with plenty of tables, some in the shade and some in the sun.

The roasted Feta is no longer on the Happy Hour menu - has slid over to a &#34;small plate&#34; for twice the price.  The fancy cocktails we were told were not at happy hour prices either.  I had two of my favorite Mandarin Orange Martinis in a relatively short period of time - could not taste a bit of alcohol.  Supposed to be 3 varieties in one of those drinks. The waiter didn&#39;t ask us if we wanted food - had to literally physically flag him back down (away from his buddies) to order after he brought our drinks.  Then  - last but not least at 10:30 the lights are turned out around us and we&#39;re shown the door &#34;time to go!&#34; in a technique I&#39;ve seen used by football coaches to clear the playing field.   There was another couple who was also herded out.  Guess the family was tired and ready to go home on a slow night? 
What the hell has happened to my favorite little place?  New waiter/bartender who seemed far more interested in visiting with his buddies back over at the bar than actually serving people - then the group appeared anxious to pack up and take THEIR party elsewhere.  OUCH.  My feelings are hurt and seriously wondering if I&#39;ll ever go back."

I&#39;m another one of those people who always walked by Bourbon Grill without knowing what I was missing. Let me tell you, it is well worth waiting in line and every penny you spend. I&#39;ve lived in the downtown area for years and my only regrets about this place is that I didn&#39;t try it sooner or more often. Everything is great, and there are so many weird and eclectic pairings to try that it should keep me coming back for some time. They have Asian, they have barbecue, they have Cajun. They have Philly Cheesesteaks. A god damn Philly from this place is under $6! A no shit 3 pound box of food is $8! And it&#39;s all delicious!

I would consider this food to be fast food mixed with comfort street food. We have always had the #1 special, which is the bourbon chicken and two sides. The bourbon chicken is so soft, tender, and juicy. The rice below the bourbon chicken soaks it up so you get the flavor with every bite. I&#39;ve had a variety of sides before and my favorites are the mac and cheese, and the sliced potatoes. I&#39;ve also tried the spicy noodles and french fries which are nothing to go crazy about. 

Try the Lemonade, its homemade! Absolutely delicious, you probably wont make it home before you have finished it!

The average plate of this place is $8 and it feeds both me and my very hungry husband. You cant go wrong with some comfort food for so cheap!"

Both sides were delicious! The fish needed a bit more flavor, but was still good. I had no problem with a long line, it took approximately 10 minutes to order and get my food because they cook the fish to order.

It&#39;s basically a spot with a walk up window.  You order your food and wait about 10 minutes and grab your food togo.  I did notice a small table where you could eat, but it&#39;s a pretty busy street so I doubt it would be pleasant to eat there.  I ordered the bourbon chicken with 2 sides meal deal.  It was about $8.  The 2 sides I chose were mac n cheese and potatoes.

Bourbon chicken - So flavorful and moist. Plenty of chicken piled onto the white rice.
Mac n Cheese - It&#39;s not the fancy mac n cheese but it was so delish.  Tons of flavor, gooey cheese.
Potatoes - Flavorful cajun style.  A bit greasy but who cares when it tastes so good.

Overall, tons of awesome flavorful food at an affordable price.  The one meal deal I bought turned into 2 great meals."

However the sauces from the sides can cover the fish. I chose the steamed green beans and the cajun potatoes. The potatoes had a lot of &#34;sauce,&#34; which I think was just the oil it was cooked with. It went over the green beans and the rice, which added extra flavor to everything. I also really enjoyed my friend&#39;s side of spicy noodles. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. The spices were delicious and reminded me of the food I had in New Orleans last year!"

You absolutely will be full the rest of the day.  For $10, I guess you could say that&#39;s a hell of a deal.

This is a highly regarded place in the neighborhood.  There is always a line, and with cold weather out, it didn&#39;t stop anyone.  You were either someone checking it out for the first time (my friend and I, two other random people) or you&#39;ve been coming to this place for quite a while.  The men in front of me could describe everything about the place, and also would warn every person about the towing company that would eyeball every car that parks in the Burger King parking lot.  Signs are well posted everywhere about this towing company.  They walk around knowing this too, walking into the cigarette store and around Burger King.  Whatever.  

My favorite thing was the macaroni and cheese, and the Cajun Potatoes.  A neat spice to both without being overbearing.  I&#39;d come back for these for sure.

So, I think you&#39;ll either love this place, and come back a lot.  Or you&#39;ll never return.  Guess it&#39;s up to you to find out."

The #1 combo was my pick which was bourbon chicken with two sides. I chose the steamed cabbage and green beans. The chicken was very good as was the cabbage. The green beans were meh. While I was eating, it was a four star meal. About an hour after I ate, I was unbelievably thirsty. I&#39;d noticed the food was salty, particularly the cabbage.

The salt factor made this a 3. And the bloating and dry mouth while guzzling a bunch of water made this even fewer stars.  Enjoy the food but be prepared to be really thirsty."

This is, by far, absolutely the best bang for the buck at lunch. The amount of food you get for under $10 is enormous and usually accommodates my lunch needs for 2 days in a row.
The bourbon chicken is great for the most part, besides the times that it&#39;s somewhat burned. The rice is well, rice, and my my personal favorite sides are the cabbage and the noodles which always taste awesome!
I always call ahead in order to avoid the long lines during lunch and that saves me tons of time. And if you feel like going full-kill on your healthy diet, pair the chicken with a nice, overrated donut from Voodoo and you&#39;re all set for the lunch, dinner, and breakfast the next day."

The downsides are very limited parking (don&#39;t park in the Burger King!) and the only onsite eating area is two sidewalk tables that will never be confused for the cute French cafe experience on Colfax. 

Truth be told, I wasn&#39;t really sure what they served here when I came. The sign says bourbon chicken, but I didn&#39;t really know what that was. I just figured it was going to be good and unhealthy. I was wrong on the second count. They have great steamed vegetable options.

I called in my order. I did not know that meant I could skip the line, but apparently it does. And apparently the line is always long and you are standing in the cold while waiting. Luckily the food was still pretty hot even after waiting in a line I didn&#39;t need to be in for almost 20 minutes.

We ordered:
Cajun spicy (super peppery and delicious)
2 orders of Hot (perfect amount of hot)
BBQ (not a fan of the sauce they use, too sweet or something)
Mac n Cheese (creamy and delicious)
Potatoes (Cooked to perfection)
Total order was only $34, not bad.
p.s. they do not have bleu cheese here, only ranch. 

When first arriving and waiting, the gang I was about to meet up with called letting me know, &#34;hey, we called it in, that means you just walk up to the window and pay, you don&#39;t have to wait in line&#34; but by then it was awkward, I was already standing in line for a while and there was one person back there working. Right after he took orders he started running around making their food, coming back and doing it again. I could not really get his attention. 

They should not just have one person here at a time! That poor guy was working so hard and doing a great job of moving fast and doing everything at once, but my god, pay to have someone else help! They need a cashier. Especially because the guy preparing the food did not have time to take his gloves off in between running around so he kept them on while handling money and putting together orders, gross!!

FINALLY a couple more people came to work and I was able to jump in while the guy was making the peoples order in front of me and pay for my food and get going after all that unnecessary waiting. They have a million signs up saying &#34;DON&#39;T PARK AT BURGER KING&#34; maybe put up just one sign saying &#34;Call ahead orders proceed to the front right away.&#34;

Food was a great value overall. But next time I am making someone else go pick it up, and I&#39;ll be hoping the person handling the money is not also handling my food."

This is literally a hole in the wall.  We happened to be walking by and caught the amazing smell of BBQ and saw there was a line so we decided on it for dinner the next night. The place is run by a husband and wife and when we went they were the only ones there. So with people standing in line and then waiting for your food to be prepared- if you are in a hurry maybe this is not the place for you. But if you want fresh BBQ with great flavor give it a chance. The only downfall is the location. East Colfax is pretty rough- so if you can handle that then you will be fine.

This food will make you want to take a nap afterwards though. This food is so good, I fell asleep riding in my friends car to this place because just the thought of this food envelopes me. If you&#39;ve never been here, order the #1... You would never think this place would be so good, it&#39;s just a hole in the wall with a line usually outside of it. I don&#39;t even have a clue how Burger King next door competes with the smells coming out of this place. There is something special about this place, a must try"

Like everyone else, I had seen the lines.  I live pretty damn close to the place, just never thought to try it out.  Then, a few days ago, I was in a friend&#39;s car, driving by the place, and the delicious smell drifted into the car and both of us had to comment on how fantastic it smelled.

So, I decided to go today.  It should be said that I walked through a hail storm to get this food, so there was an extra expectation due to my efforts.

The chicken is outstanding.  OUTSTANDING.  I ordered the simple #1, which is chicken, rice, two sides and a drink.  I tend to avoid &#34;bourbon chicken&#34; joints, because I&#39;m always disappointed when I bite into small chunks of fat, gristle, and - if I&#39;m lucky - a little bit of greasy chicken.

This is not that chicken.  This is huge, tender, delicious hunks of sweetly marinated chicken.  I bit into nothing stringy or hard, this is not chicken that was cut up haphazardly. For my sides, I got the cajun potatoes and mac &amp; cheese.  The cajun potatoes are most of the reason I docked them a star, because they weren&#39;t really special at all.  As others have said in their reviews, the potatoes aren&#39;t cooked all the way through, and are basically just greasy, flimsy and not very well flavored.  I didn&#39;t even eat them.  The mac and cheese was a bit runny, but I enjoyed the flavor.  This isn&#39;t mac and cheese you&#39;re never gonna forget, but as a side, I was glad I picked it.  

After reading reviews, I think I&#39;d try a chicken sandwich next time.  I can imagine those just being off-the-charts amazing.  And, I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention that the couple running the place was wonderfully friendly and talkative. 

Will definitely be back!"

Its street food at its finest. Be prepared to not have a place to sit to eat because the line can get really really long. Also come ready to be heckled if you do sit down to eat.

After my first visit I would only have given it three stars, but yesterday I went again and got sides with my chicken and rice and they were interesting. Please note this is a Denver 4, not a New York 4 where there are abundant and amazing and fast chicken and rice places of every ethnnicity pretty much on every street corner of the magical northeast.

My favorite part is the handwritten alarming sign about not parking at Burger King and your car will get booted as soon as you step out of it. That is fast service, Burger King. 

My least favorite part is that they are slow. Like everything is already made. It should be like &#39;I want Chicken&#39;, boom, &#39;I want noodles&#39; Boom, &#39;I want corn&#39; boom done. That is how you do takeout windows. But for some reason they just write down what you want on the styrofoam container and then you wait at least 5 minutes. When I go home and get some Puerto Rican food, I will be out the door in under a minute even if there&#39;s a line. Coloradoans are very slow I have noticed. 

The first time I ate there, I only got chicken and rice. My boyfriend got sides and one was called Spicy Noodles. I assumed it was an Asian style noodle when I tasted his, so imagine my surprise when it was regular old thin spaghetti, aka vermicelli with some spices on it. Like idk, maybe a cajun spice blend? It was like when you think you&#39;re having Sprite, but then it&#39;s water and your mouth is all confused and surprised. But this time I knew what to expect and ordered my own side of it. It definitely grows on you."

I chose the bourbon chicken (comes with rice) and had the macaroni and cheese and green beans for sides. This was a KILLER meal. The place itself is tiny; there is only seating outside. This was no problem for me as I wanted to run back to my apartment to veg and watch Amazon Prime anyway. If you are expecting a sparkling clean joint, look elsewhere. However, in my opinion these kinds of places are hidden gems. 
They use chicken thighs for their bourbon chicken (points!) and it was delightfully charred and saucy all at once. The rice was semi-sweet; perhaps from the bourbon sauce on the chicken? Not sure. The green beans were not the mushy kind you find in a can; instead, they were clearly cooked as fresh and were still a medium-crisp. They were also perfectly salted and had a minor garlic touch. The sharp cheddar macaroni and cheese nicely complimented the sweet of the chicken and the rice. 
And the portions...Lord. I did finish my entire container, but I may have had to take a break for a few hours in between attempts. 
All of this for around $10! I highly recommend stopping by this place if you want food that is made with care; you can tell that they give a s&amp;$* here, and that is always nice :)"

Once we finally sat down and started eating, it was hard to stop. The chicken was delicious and tasty.

The 5-star says it all, &#34;Woohoo! As good as it gets!&#34;  Bourbon Grill is a walk-up window located on Colfax that serves up some amazing comfort/soul food!  There is no seating except for two tables outside on the sidewalk in front of the place.  

Basically, everyone gets Bourbon Chicken, this is what they are known for.  While waiting in line, you can tell everyone is excited about their future meal.  Whenever someone comes up and asks, &#34;is this place really that good?&#34; or &#34;I have never been here what should I get?&#34;  The entire line will say, &#34;yes it is good&#34;, &#34;yes it is worth the wait&#34;, &#34;I have never had anything except Bourbon Chicken!&#34; or my personal fav, &#34;I once got the BBQ Chicken, never again.  It is good, but its no Bourbon Chicken.&#34;  You get the idea.  Bourbon Grill patrons are very loyal and loving to their chicken! 

I always get the Combo #1.  Bourbon Chicken, 2 sides and a drink.  If you are worried about portions, don&#39;t be.  Bourbon Grill will give you enough for two full meals!  As for the sides, you really cannot go wrong with whatever you get.  My go-to is Mac &amp; Cheese and Green Beans with an orange soda.  The spicy noodles are also very good as well.

A Vietnamese family operates this little place and these guys know how to satisfy hungry customers.  

For $7.25, I ordered the Bourbon Chicken dinner. The meal comes with a heaping scoop of white rice and two sides, in which I took Cajun-seasoned potatoes and steamed vegetables. I also got a cup of homemade Lemonade for $2.00. Despite having two tables in front of the tiny place, I took my 5lb dinner to bring back to my hotel, which is only two blocks away. Besides, Colfax Avenue is not the Marina District, Noe Valley or Wilshire Blvd. 

As I opened my container, I see a mountain of marinated chicken pieces flooded all over the container. The chicken pieces were seasoned and charred very nicely. It wasn&#39;t dry either. As I was eating my meal, I was also counting the pieces that were given to me; 23 marinated chicken pieces. That is more or less equivalent to one whole chicken.

The $2.00 Lemonade was voted as best in Denver for 2007. It seems that the little place hasn&#39;t lost a touch. The Lemonade was very refreshing (sorry no photo).

This tiny place does very well in Denver, especially during lunchtime. But this place would undeniably kick ass in San Francisco.

Last time I waited in the cold,&#39;I wasn2nd in line and it took about a half hour. I guess people call in and they get served first?

Bourbon Grill was an easy walk and a great place to get some filling cheap food to soak up the booze.

I don&#39;t live in that &#39;hood anymore so I don&#39;t get here as often as I used to but when I&#39;m up that way I stop by for a fix.  The Bourbon Chicken is the bomb.  A big pile of slightly charred dark meat chicken in an additive slightly sweetish sauce kind of reminiscent of teriyaki.  It&#39;s served on a very ample portion of white rice which I really should skip but the sauce drips down into it and it usually disappears.  You get a couple of sides, too.  The mac and cheese is a must for me and then I try to order something green for the other to try and convince myself that I&#39;m eating &#34;healthy&#34;.  All this is at least two meals for around $8.50 - such a deal.

So, put on your big boy pants and brave the &#34;challenges&#34; of this stretch of East Colfax (you never know who or what is going to be in line) and enjoy some good, tasty takeout at an embarrassingly reasonable price.  Definitely worth a shot."

So after reading all the raving reviews about BG, I finally went the other night.  I got the classic Bourbon Chicken combination, which comes with two sides and rice. I got the Mac and cheese and mixed veggies. The chicken chunks were HUGE and when they put it on top of the rice, it soaked up ALL the delicious juice from the chicken which made the rice EFFING delicious. The mac and cheese was decent. It was bright yellow and reminded me of Kraft. Also, the portion you will get can probably feed a small village in India, so you will definitely have leftover for the next day ( that is, if you have enough self control and not devour the whole meal in the first place)

The chicken is killer! Always cooked perfect, super moist and tender, flavor is amazing. HUGE portions for cheap! I usually get the green beans and Cajun potatoes as the side. The beans are fresh and flavorful. The potatoes are delicious, the flavor is there, sometimes hit and miss with how cooked thru they are. Lately it&#39;s been good. And microwaved the next day (cause there will definitely be left overs), they&#39;re usually perfect. 
The dude who owns it and his wife are always friendly too, they prefer cash, but take credit as well ;)
Swing by. It looks sketchy, but I consider it one of the best secret spots in Denver."

I didn&#39;t try Bourbon Grill for the longest time because of that reason. It looks pretty sketch.

No dining room here, just a hole in the wall (on Colfax no less) smacked next to a Burger King. The diners could range from the people who call the street home to a businessman in tie. However all it takes is one deep breath in while driving by to make your mouth water with curiosity.

I ordered the Bourbon Chicken the first time, and I now do every time. The nicely charred but juicy chicken is coated in a lovely bourbon sauce over a huge bed of rice.
Two heaping sides are also served. I&#39;ve tried them all. My favorites are: the Mac n cheese. I compare it to the stuff I used to have in school, with big noodles and thick, gooey cheesy sauce. Cajun potatoes are the bomb. I don&#39;t know what they season them with, but it&#39;s perfect, and they&#39;re just the right amount of greasy. Spicy noodles have made the list recently, consisting of spaghetti noodles with a spicy reddish sauce. 

The steamed veggies and corn have done me pretty well too at times! 

It comes with a soda as well, but I always opt for the fresh lemonade for no extra charge.

All of this is included for under ten bucks. I easily get two, sometimes three meals out of one! Hard to beat these prices.

My only complaint is the parking nightmare - and I am not being dramatic here. It may seem like many parking spots are available - but they are not if you&#39;re going to bourbon grill. Neighboring businesses have tow trucks waiting in back recently, watching people walk to the grill. Don&#39;t even think about using the BK lot either. Your best bet is the single Meter spot right before the bus stop directly in front, or walking a bit."

You know a good restaurant when it consistently has a line. My husband and I walked to this place on Saturday. I ordered the #2 combo (BBQ chicken and rice, mac n cheese, french fries). The husband ordered a cheese steak and fries. 

First of all, the sides are really delicious. This is definitely a comfort-food type place so you shouldn&#39;t come here expected fancy, gourmet, anything but good traditional comfort food. The mac n cheese was really creamy and delicious. I decided to put the mac n cheese ON my fries and eat them together. This was an ah-mazing idea and I highly recommend it. 

My fiance really enjoyed his cheese steak. He commented on how the onions were perfectly caramelized. My BBQ chicken wasn&#39;t exactly my favorite, but I think that&#39;s just me being particular. I felt that the BBQ sauce was a little sweet for my liking - I&#39;m more of a smokey BBQ type of person. Having said that, the chicken was incredibly moist; it fell apart on my fork. Next time, I&#39;ll order the #1 combo (with bourbon chicken instead of BBQ) and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll love it. 

So yes, this place is on Colfax. Yes, it doesn&#39;t look fancy and has no indoor seating. But YES do they make some really good food for $8 with humongous portions. We&#39;ll be back.

PS - This place does accept credit cards."

I was in the area and needed to grab dinner so why not this place? It&#39;s a small, hole-in-the-wall take out place. I first asked what bourbon chicken was and she gave me a sample that seemed like the size of a meal! I was almost full before I ordered. Ok, not true... but it&#39;s not to get a sample where you could actually taste the product!!

She said #1 was most popular and I already had my eye on it so I went with it. Basically, it&#39;s a bed of rice with a ton of chicken and two sides (mine were mac n cheese and cabbage). The only change I&#39;ll make next time is I&#39;ll ask them to skip rice as I normally don&#39;t eat it anyway (or just ask for a fraction of it because you get a ton!). With this you also get a drink and it totals around $8 or so. It was so much food that I had plenty left over for lunch the next day.

As for the chicken, I thought it was great. It was juicy, had great flavor, and cut into manageable pieces. The mac n cheese was good and I thought the cabbage was the perfect complement for the chicken. I think there are maybe half a dozen options for sides but I don&#39;t remember them all.

Not only was this value but it was good and a great option whether or not you&#39;re on a budget! I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

The recommendation didnt dissapoint.  Now as most people have said, this place is a a little hole in the wall place where you order at a window and you take your food to go.  There are a couple of tables set up outside on the sidewalk but its really not a place to sit and eat.  That being said the combination plates are about $8.50 after tax and it comes with a heaping portion of chicken, rice (flavored with the chicken sauce), 2 sides and a small soda.  Portion sizes are huge and for most folks its enough for lunch and dinner.  

Overall  the meal is a great value and the flavors are decent.  The chicken is well flavored but as some reviewers have stated, the pieces can be a little dry.  In my opinion I did not mind this since thats the way I like it.    For my sides I got the mac and cheese and the the cajun potatoes.  The mac and cheese was good and it came with a little bit of corn mixed in.  I also got the seasoned cajun potatoes which i dipped into the mac and cheese sauce.  The potatoes were nicely seasoned but some pieces were a little undercooked."

Well I guess Women are right alot of the time. 

The 2 Employees were busy behind the counter making up orders but they did acknowledge i was their and would be a little bit. 

Well I ordered the Bourbon Chicken, with Cajun Potatoes and Mac And Cheese. 

OMG. The bird who sacrificed himself for my lunch was so tasty. Big Huge Chunks of chicken and this was big enough to split into two meals. 

The sauce was great as it dripped down into the rice. It was sweet with a honey base but not to sweet. The Mac and cheese had real CHEESE and the Cajun Potatoes were on point. How can such a small space produce such great food? I&#39;m sure somewhere she has a pot of love she puts in her cooking. 
 
The Smell even drifts over to 15th Ave, which this would be a Gluttonous Sin of mine if i Lived in the Area. And its definitely worth repeat trips from Lakewood to come down and Eat at.

The place was quiet, but not too quiet, and as people were getting off of work, they came streaming in. Our hostess/server was quite friendly, quick and informative. Just a really nice person to be in this job. Having fun while working, always a good sign.

I opted for a cider that I have had before, that I really like, and though often in bottles in smaller places, it was on tap here. It makes a nicer option for me. And they added a slice of fresh fruit to it, a nice touch. My husband had a beer he likes but rarely gets around to buying for home. We shared the warm pretzel with cheddar beer fondue dipping sauce. Just perfect on a cold blustery day and not so much that it would spoil our appetite for our planned dinner.

And now for some more-detailed, yet brief notes:
- our waitress was awesome (I think her name was Brandy)
- the bacon-wrapped dates were amazing, so much that I wanted to order another plate, but mom wouldn&#39;t let me because we had entrees on the way, which was probably smart
- salad was good
- salmon on my salad was overcooked
- my sister&#39;s burger was undercooked
- good portion size
- pretty expensive, but I guess I&#39;d expect that based on the location
- they go all out for birthday celebrations, bringing out my bro-in-law a dessert and a card signed by all the staff at the restaurant

The downside is the food. Despite having a huge menu, they really only have lots of really heavy dinner food on the menu. The vast majority of their options such as filet mignon, salmon, reuben, orange chicken (?), mac and cheese are all great, but are really not what I&#39;m interested in when I walk into a sports bar. Even the salads here - smoked chicken waldorf, brussels sprouts, quinoa, chicken, seared ahi, etc. - while great &amp; healthy and all that, are just a little fancy for my taste, and hard to eat while watching football. 

When I&#39;m at a sports bar, I&#39;m looking for some quick and easy eats. And outside of getting the burger (which I had done already twice before coming in during the previous 24 hours), or getting pizza (which I ended up getting), this place doesn&#39;t have too much in the way of good bar food.

The booths, bar high tables, high ceilings, and attractive waitresses are straight from the American restaurant playbook.

The menu has something for everyone..including a couple of vegetarian-friendly dishes. I&#39;ve had a pretty healthy pan-fried chicken and vegetable dish which was ok, just average. The fish &amp; chips was recommended as one of the faster dishes (unlike the pizza) which looked good, but the fish was fairly bland despite throwing on lemon juice and tartare sauce; the fries were the skinny kind which aren&#39;t my favorite.

I appreciate the broad menu with a number of vegetarian options, and also their numerous draft beer choices - nothing beats a cold beer when it&#39;s nearing 100 outside. I had a couple beers and the Fish and Chips. I guess I was expecting a more unique flavor from the fish with the menu going out of its way to call them &#34;IPA-Battered&#34; but that wasn&#39;t something I necessarily picked up. The portion was large, and both the fish and potatoes were well fried and seasoned.

Great service, nice atmosphere, indoor and outdoor seating galore.

I started with The Tap Takeover, a sample of six beers for just $10. Each sample is 5 ounces, so it&#39;s a killer deal. They have a great beer selection. I didn&#39;t know I could have chosen any six beers to sample, so I had six IPAs. I&#39;m not a fan of IPA, and they were all too hoppy for me. Just know you can pick your beers for the Tap Takeover and you&#39;ll be delighted.

The food was fantastic. All of it. I split the beer battered fish and chips with my dad. They were so cool,  they split the plate for us before they served it. Very cool! Also,we had some pulled pork sliders, yes on those. Waldorf chicken salad, another winner, and the rueben sandwich delivered!

While some have described this place as loud, I had no issues as I prefer loud music rather than being disturbed by the conversations from the other diners nearby. I wanted something light so I ordered the prosciutto flatbread. The flatbread contains a nice mixture of melted cheeses but the best (surprisingly) part about it was the candied hazelnuts that came with the flatbread. The sweet hazelnuts combo with the salty prosciutto was excellent. The servers at the bar were very attentive and the food came out pretty fast. Definitely plan to return to try something else."

The Eggs Benedict was one of the best Ive ever had. Taste as well as presentation was A++. Other aspects that I thought were amazing was the orange juice, it tasted like they hand picked and hand squeezed the fruit right from the tree. When I asked for some ketchup, instead of bringing me an old plastic bottle, the waitress brought out a little serving dish that was on a plate with a little napkin, now that&#39;s class."

It was light and had a crunchy texture and buttery flavor that made every bite melt in your mouth ate it very slowly to savor every delicious flavor.

We ordered the spicy Mac and Cheese. I had read other reviews on here saying it&#39;s really spicy so I was hesitant on ordering it. I&#39;m kind of a wimp with spicy food and it has the perfect amount of spice. It was totally tolerable and super yummy. It was creamy cheesy goodness with sausage and bell peppers. I definitely suggest ordering it!

I had the Caprese sandwich with French fries and it was lovely. Chicken, fresh mozzarella, pesto, along with other yummy ingredients. The fries were perfectly crispy.
 
My friends ordered the fish and chips and the other got the Italian prosciutto pizza. They both loved their dishes. The fish and chips were very fresh and the pizza was super yummy!

We mentioned that it was our friends birthday and our waitress got her ice cream with fresh chocolate sauce. Chantelle(our waitress) was super sweet, she even got a birthday card and had all the waiters to sign it! So personal and sweet! 

I suggest getting a reservation so avoid the wait! We got there about thirty minutes early for our reservation and they were able to sit us! Super accommodating and awesome restaurant!"

On a not-busy-at-all Wednesday evening is stopped in for a drink and an appetizer.  The staff behind the bar was friendly, that is, when they decide to pay attention to you.  Waited overly long to get a drink menu (a necessity since the taps aren&#39;t labeled), overly long for the waitress to return for my drink order, and overly long for her to pour a single beer.

She returned a couple minutes after delivering my drink to see if I wanted food.  Again, after an oddly long time, she returned to take my order (seared tuna).

If this delay wasn&#39;t enough, it then took about 30 minutes (yes, I&#39;m only POSSIBLY exaggerating by about 5 minutes) for an appetizer of seared tuna to come out.  I was about to cancel my order, but the girl behind the bar had disappeared (as she had done a couple times before).  When the tuna arrived, it was burnt (not seared) and was seasoned O.K.

People were standing around doing nothing while I waited.  Best they will be able to get me back for is an occasional beer unless they make some drastic changes."

The dish comes with a moderately tender Salmon, on top of a delicious Risotto.

The Grilled Salmon is cooked quite well, it has a dash of salt and is not overly dry (a common problem with other Grilled Salmon dishes). There is a nice grilled exterior with a somewhat tender interior.

The Risotto has a diverse combo of spices and ingredients that come together to make a tasty foundation for the dish. There are parts of it that are savory, parts that are slightly sweet, and it is fully delicious.

The service is standard, nothing too special here. I also had a taste of some fries and they are a bit bland. Not sure how the rest of their menu plays out, but I had a great time with my order."

It&#39;s centrally located in downtown Denver right next to Union Station with one of the largest patio&#39;s in Denver.  In addition, its proximity to my office makes it an easy choice for lunch or drinks after work.

The drink and food menus are both ridiculously large with something for everyone.  For the food, I enjoy the Scotch Eggs, Fried Calamari, and Potato Bacon Cakes from the HH menu.  They have an All Day menu, so don&#39;t be surprised to spend closer to dinner prices for lunch.

I have a few issues with the libations at Thirsty Lion.  First, I do not appreciate receiving day or two old slices of lemons and limes in drinks I&#39;m paying $8+ for.  When limes have a brown edge, it&#39;s obvious they were sliced days ago and the taste is bitter and unpleasant (arg!).  Please, please slice garnish the day of, it doesn&#39;t take a lot of effort or planning.  Second, I find it odd that I cannot order a double for any alcoholic beverage (wha?).  Okay, no double, can I have a shot on the side - NOPE, I&#39;ve been told that is a double!  Keep getting a spiel about strict Denver regulations on booze from the staff.  I do drink at other establishments in Denver (shocker) and can order a double or a shot on the side when I like with no issues - not sure what they&#39;re talking about.

I have a few gripes, but overall Thirsty Lion is a good spot for drinking, eating and people watching on the patio."

The tavern burger was amazing and delicious. The peppered maple bacon was incredible and the beers on offer were diverse and tasty. 

The only negative in my experience was the noise level.  Not that the crowd was too rowdy, but rather they could use some noise dampening panels or roof fixtures."

While they have a great location, good beer selection and a good food the service sucks. If been here alone and with friends and I cannot remember a time when I was impressed with the service. You see a bunch of people working but they never seem to come to your table. 

Also, if you want a drink that requires the bartender to muddle mint then don&#39;t order it here. They throw the mint in the glass, then the ice and then muddle. So they are essentially watering down your drink. 

If you are with a group and downtown this might be a good place. If you want to sit somewhere and watch a game, go to Blake St Tavern."

I don&#39;t work downtown so when I find somewhere that has happy hour during the weekend, I&#39;m in. We found a seat at the bar and they were right in the middle of a shift change so it was a bit hectic among the bar staff. They have $4 wines, well drinks and draft of the day during happy hour along with a food menu. I got the Tuscan kale salad ($5) and Pear and Proscuitto Flatbread ($6) and it was amazing. Who knew they would have a killer kale salad and creative flatbreads? Yeah, the name has Gastropub in it but Thirsty Lion seems more like an upscale bar than anything.

We were hungry, and ready to throw down, so we walked down the 16th Street Mall.  

Nothing really popped out (mostly chains) at us until we got near the end.  We saw a place with glass walls, propane heaters (the nice standing unit ones), and called a gastropub. It was still a young night at the time (it was about 1730) and didn&#39;t look crowded so we walked in.  

Two things I noticed immediately- the hostesses and waitresses, and the decor.  They have some decent looking staff!  Along for the decor, there is an open kitchen, black walls, a large bar in the center with plenty of TVs, and plenty of seating.  They have booths, high tops, regular tables, and plenty of patio seating.  This place is a decent size. 

The first visit, we got a booth.  When we got seated and were handed the menus- i was excited to see the variety.  Speaking of variety, they have 52 beers on tap, that can be served in 13,16, or 20 oz glasses. Can&#39;t make up your mind? They have a beer flight, 6 beers @ 4.5 oz for $10. 

They also have seasonal menus, which had some stellar food- like that pork tenderloin.  In fact, that night, I ordered a pretzel, a pizza, then the pork loin.  It was a tough walk back to the hotel that night.  If it weren&#39;t for the fact the soap in the bathroom shot out at me like something from a porno, I would have gone back the next night.  

Last night, Arthur and I planned to go to Mercantile for dinner.  But not with a 2 hour wait.  So we went back to TL last night.  It was busy, but we got seated immediately.  

I saw they still had the Winter menu with that pork; I was sold.  Got the pretzel again as well.  And LOTS of drinks.  Thankfully I wasn&#39;t driving!  I got another flatbread for dessert.  Everything was great last night. Even Arthur said the salmon he ordered was some of the best he has had- and had a nice portion.  

And check this out, when I went to the bathroom, the soap dispenser changed!  I didn&#39;t have to fear for my pants having unexplainably white stains on them!  That alone made my evening.  

Forget the Tilted Kilt or Twin Peaks. This place has killer mixed drinks, great beer selection, the staff does&#39;t wear goody outfits, and the food is true to gastropubbery- and it actually takes good!  I will definitely keep coming back!"

I started with a martini and we shared the artichoke dip which were great.

I had the NW pub burger and my friend had the beef tips. Both were... Underwhelming. Nothing terrible but nothing I would order again.

I would recommend staying away from the California Rolls and Fish and Chips.  But would highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates and Beef Tips served on mashed potatoes. I do love their white cheddar mashed potatoes. The Romano Herb Crusted Chicken is ok too. 

The service is hit or miss and the only thing I see this place really has going for it is the location. The atmosphere is great for get togethers if you like sitting at high table and sit on stools. If you are looking for a cozier setting, definately request a booth."

When we walked up we were shocked at how busy it was, especially for a Wednesday night! But don&#39;t be put off bc there were plenty of tables available (the dining room and patio are HUGE!) and we found seats at the bar almost immediately. Ashley took excellent care of us and another dark haired bartender whose name we didn&#39;t catch, she was great too. We shared a few things and enjoyed all of it. We started with the shrimp ceviche on the specials. It was pretty good, my only issue was the avocado wasn&#39;t ripe. I mean, c&#39;mon, we are in Colorado and it&#39;s August! It certainly didn&#39;t ruin our meal tho.
Next up we had the steak salad! Holy crap! The steak was so flavorful. The salad was made with fresh ingredients and the dressing was on point! We also shared the grilled salmon with risotto and asparagus! DANK! The risotto was cheesy, the salmon&#39;s flavor was amazing and was cooked to perfection (medium rare...how I like it, but ask for whatever temp you want if you don&#39;t like MR). She had wine, I had a vodka drink, and our bill was reasonably $85 after the 20% tip. We will be going back!"

This developing chain newly opened location is easy to find right on the corner of Wynkoop St. at Denver&#39;s Union Station. They also have locations in Oregon and Arizona.

Inside: Spacious layout with large comfy booths, Bar area and tables. Dark wood paneling is everywhere mimicking a traditional British Pub but is offset by the large windows.

Food: Although I have only been to Thirsty Lion once I must say I was pleased with the quality and speed of the kitchen. I enjoyed the Peppercorn Beef Tenderloin Tips entree. About 4oz. of Tender beef seasoned well but not overly so served on top of a mountainous heap of White Cheddar Mashed potatoes and Steamed Green beans and red peppers. Granted I am not much of a sweet tooth in general- however I was coxed to attempt the cheesecake dessert. This slice must weigh in at a full lb of creamy cheesecake goodness-- much recommended!

Service: Prompt and friendly but inexperienced. During the middle of a rather busy dinner time- my food arrived in less than 10 mins.

The Thirsty Lion is one of the newest editions to the Union Station area.  It&#39;s conveniently located close to Coors Field (about a half a mile), so come before the game for some great food and drinks.  Oh, did I mention that the servers are smokin&#39; hot, too?  Well....they are. This place is great!  

I was thoroughly impressed with the menu here.  I went with a Caprese Chicken Sandwich (grilled chicken breast, fresh mozzarella, vine ripe tomato, spicy pepperoni, sweet pepper tapenade, garlic pesto aioli, arugula and olive oil on grilled ciabatta bread).  That sucker was delicious!  Better bring a bib for that one.  It&#39;s juicy.  The fries are hand cut and toothsome.  An item that really surprised me was the Tuscan Kale Salad (currants &amp; almonds, fresh tuscan kale, lemon shallot vinaigrette, zante currants and shaved asiago cheese).  It was incredible.

You like beer?  You&#39;ll find it here.  They have 52 beers on tap.  If beer is not your thing, don&#39;t fret.  The Thirsty Lion offers a full wine list, along with several cocktail options.

Hey, I know this sounds sexist, but the gals here are hot!  They are scantly clad, to say the least.  You might think twice about bringing children here.

Location/Ambiance - 5
Ease of Reservation - 5
Management - 5
Food - 4 
Service - 0

Situated in the heart of Denver&#39;s NEW Union Station neighborhood, Thirsty Lion&#39;s potential is out of this world! Flowered-line patio, huge indoor bar, lots of seating, fun music, tons of TVs, and the perk of being in Union Station will definitely help.  However, and a big however at that, from the one experience we had at this place, their service definitely needs to improve.  Being familiar with the restaurant industry - I want to note that my complaint on service isn&#39;t harsh, lacking sympathy for the adjustment period of a new restaurant.  Our server was just terrible. 

Came in on a Friday night - July 25th to be specific.  We were sat right away - no wait.  I can&#39;t even tell you how long it took for our server to come by and greet us.  When she did, my husband asks what beer they have and she responds &#34;it&#39;s on the back of your menu, I&#39;ll be back.&#34;  Seven minutes go back and she&#39;s finally back for me to ask her about wine, her response:  &#34;is house fine?&#34;  Well I mean sure, if you don&#39;t want to try to sell me into a better wine - then fine?? I went for a better wine even so.  

Best part:  SHE DIDN&#39;T CARD EITHER OF US.  While my husband is carded everywhere he goes, I am at times forgot about. Sad face.  But she didn&#39;t card either one of us!  In Denver, that&#39;s just a no no! 

Onto the food... So, between the long waits of menu review, we finally had her attention to ask questions about the food.  I ask how the Enchiladas are, her response:  &#34;Gross. Since you asked.&#34;  Again?  Seriously?  I appreciate the honesty, believe me do I - but &#34;GROSS&#34;?  Way to sell this new restaurant&#39;s product!!  So I move on and order the Spicy Mac &amp; Cheese.  She did make one recommendation, which was to change out the Sausage for Chicken in the Mac &amp; Cheese to calm the spiciness just a bit.

Maybe 15 minutes go by and she finally delivers our beer &amp; wine.  As she was pouring my wine, she slopped a massive amount of it on my knife. Lovely, and not even an apology or attempt to clean it up!  Then the food arrived, fairly normal wait, with a MASSIVE amount of Scallions on my Mac &amp; Cheese... which I specifically said I don&#39;t want Scallions or any type of Green Onion.  I&#39;m talking Scallions Galoreeee! On my husband&#39;s Burger - the Peppercorn Bacon Burger might I add - there was no Bacon to be found... 

Next thing we know - the Manager stops by to remedy the situation.  She didn&#39;t even try, she just sent him over!  So, we were slightly shocked that he stopped by to ask about our issue.  What issue?  Anyway, he was SUPER great!  Nice smile and pleasant demeanor.  Definitely made me not want to hate this place.  He brought out Bacon and gave me Sour Cream to cool down the Spicy Mac &amp; Cheese.  He was just very nice.  

BUT, no compensation for any of this.  Something to note. 

We will likely give it another try sometime in the future.  The food was delicious and I love the Union Station area.  But this time around - the $65 we spent was a waste!"

The Thirsty Lion is a great example of a bar that lacks a true vision. The ambiance is a mix of sports bar, Euro-club, and quasi-fine dining. While some may appreciate the variety, I personally find it unfocused and a bit hodgepodge. Example: the menu has offerings from burgers to pizza to Mexican dishes. The food was decent, but nothing particularly memorable.

If you&#39;re looking to please differing palates or have casual drinks, Thirsty Lion is a good spot. If a more focused dining experience is your goal, I would steer away."

They seem to have spent a pretty penny in location, setup, and overall production, but it is all for naught.  I came here with a dozen friends, looking forward to checking the spot out.  We were planning on spending the entire day there, from 11am NFL games through to Sunday Night Football.  We didn&#39;t last until two.

The service was slow, the waitress must have been born without muscles in her face to allow for a smile, and she just seemed totally disinterested with doing anything whatsoever.  She quoted me 3 different prices on drinks, brought me a beer that was not even 80% full (&#34;oh, it&#39;s for the head&#34; according to the staff), and just seemed out of it.  The food was mediocre, expensive for what it was, and not that good.

The kicker?  They put on the Broncos game on a couple TVs, and then refused to add sound to the game.  I looked around, and saw that of about 100 people in the room, only one or two weren&#39;t wearing football gear of some sort.  We asked three different people for sound, and received three different, silly explanations. 

1.  &#34;We are unable to get sound for games overheard, as we don&#39;t have the package.&#34;  You have the game on, and the sound is free, trust me.
2. &#34;We can&#39;t just choose one game to put overheard, it wouldn&#39;t be fair.&#34;  You&#39;re in Denver, downtown Denver, masquerading as a place to watch football and enjoy yourself.  YOU ARE IN DENVER.
3. &#34;It would ruin the ambiance of the restaurant.&#34;  Ha!

Whatever.  We all looked at each other, paid our tabs, and left.

This place desperately wants to be a high-end, up-scale, spend-all-your-LoDo-money-here sort of place.  But they just badly missed the mark."

Service was a joke. Took forever to get first round and appetizers, then longer to get second round. Tried to order from the bar but they refused and told us we had to wait for our waitress.... what waitress? we had different waitresses so weren&#39;t sure who to order from and they didn&#39;t both to check with us we so we had to literally flag one down. How do you forget about a group of 14 sitting at a table with empty glasses? When she finally showed up she looked surprised that we would want another round of drinks... really? When we finally got our second round the order wasn&#39;t correct and it took 20 minutes to get a missing drink..... at that time most of the group left so they wouldn&#39;t miss their buses (2 hours later)."

Who advertises to watch the game and has game day specials if you&#39;re not going to play the audio for any of them? I guess if there&#39;s a massive crowd, and everybody wants to hear the audio, you can mob the management about it and they&#39;ll give it. They told me that their standard policy was to not.

For game days, they also refused to put on the Niners vs Oakland game for me. The place wasn&#39;t packed, and there were duplicate games on a ton of TVs. It wouldn&#39;t have hurt anybody to change the channel on 1 of the 8 TVs in eyesight. The official excuse was &#34;We don&#39;t have that game available in our package,&#34; But I&#39;m pretty sure that they had Sunday ticket. Colts/Browns really isn&#39;t your average game to have on a local Denver broadcast either, but that&#39;s not why I went to the bar to start with.

Booths are much better for holding a conversation.  Dinner took a very long time to arrive but we were busy chatting.  Manager came to apologize and said he would look into what went wrong but never came back and didn&#39;t make any adjustment to our bill. Will check it out next time for happy hour.

I was here for the first time for my friends birthday dinner. There were so many menu choices! Plus a fall seasonal menu! Food choices were not too expensive either. The appetizers were great. We tried the battered scotch eggs and the ahi tuna appetizers and they were great! The ahi tuna will be a new favorite!

We all shared the orange chicken, Baja tacos, and lemon chicken. Everything was delicious and full of flavor! The lemon chicken is a MUST! 

We also ordered drinks and no one had any complaints!"

But when they have bad experience they tell 10.&#34;  I am going to tell anyone that will read this review. 

The restaurant itself is aesthetically pleasing, with a good deal of space and a fair number of TVs. In fact the beer list and menu are both solid.  Based on these facts  I would have given the thirsty lion 4 stars. 

That being said the the service is inattentive,  bordering on rude. Although our waitress was friendly, we waited 10 minutes for our drink order to be taken. Said drink order may never had been taken had I not talked to the hostess.  When I politely (I worked in restaurants for 14 years,) attempted to inform the hostess of our dilemma her demeanor and tone, made me feel as though I was bothering her.  Furthermore, I had a similar experience with a server in my 10 quest to attain ketchup. I find this to be egregious behavior from individuals in the service industry.  

In closing,  this place has great potentially but I will not return until I am convinced that they have amended these issues."

Too bad for them, we initially walked in with the intent of breakfast, multiple drinks, and buying a gift card. $100 lost by one inattentive bartender.

I had their Kung Pao chicken dish, which was overly sweet but perfectly edible.

The servers were nice but obviously didn&#39;t know much about the beer they were serving. Unfortunately, their beer menu was pretty boring anyway.

The margaritas might as well have been acid.  We returned them and bought beer and wine.

We ordered food. It was edible, at best. The fish tacos contained almost zero fish, and lots of cabbage. I spoke with Michael, the manager on duty.  He was very friendly and removed it from our order.

The bar is huge with nice TVs - perfect for game days.

We sat on the patio on a recent Saturday to watch some football, have lunch, and enjoy some unique beer and cider.

First take is how nice the furnishings are - the bathrooms are beautiful which tells me the kitchen is probably spotless.  The patio is nice and would be the perfect place for a private/rented out birthday party or something along those lines since there is cover and heaters for colder months. 

Our server was very friendly and the food was good.  I&#39;m not giving more stars because the menu is very limited in terms of meat-heavy items and cheese on everything. I realize this is a pub atmosphere but maybe a few more salads without a bunch of cheese or chicken or what have you would be welcomed."

Ashley was the hostess that greeted and seated us and she was so friendly and personable it made us feel welcomed and comfortable as soon as we arrived.

Erik was our server and he was great--very personable and efficient.  We started off ordering the fish and chips and they were absolutely delicious--table favorite.

We then ordered the kale salad, calamari, Brussels sprouts, potato cakes, and edamame. Everything was well prepared and tasty.

They have a great selection of drinks and craft beers (they will bring you a taster sample of the craft beer to see if you like it before you order it).

Definitely enjoyed our meal and it was reasonably priced."

Unfortunately we weren&#39;t that impressed. Here&#39;s the breakdown:

The Food: We&#39;ll it was alright. I won&#39;t be rushing back for anything in particular. Honestly, I&#39;ll probably stick to the HH menu. While the descriptions made each dish seem packed full of flavor and special, it just wasn&#39;t. Disappointing to say the least. We had the pretzel with cheese fondue and that was awesome. I had the IPA battered fish and chips. It really didn&#39;t seem like the IPA beer batter tasted any different than a regular beer batter. 

The Drinks: No complaints here! They have an extensive tap menu and feature some great rotating taps for seasonal items. I sipped on the Elysian Superfuzz blood orange pale ale, super tasty! The HH margarita Carrie J. had was delish too.

The Service: Staff was fairly attentive. As other reviewers mention, the female servers wear black shirts, black skirts, and black knee-high socks. Reminds me of Tilted Kilt&#39;s only less revealing.  

The Atmosphere: I liked the modern yet cozy feel of the restaurant. There were two different outdoor seating areas to soak up some summer sun. Inside there was a mixture of high bar tables, the bar its self, and some table booth combos.  

I&#39;ll be back for some HH beverages I&#39;m sure, but it&#39;s not on my &#34;OMG I have to go back right now&#34; list."

Even though there are tv&#39;s galore, the sound wasn&#39;t on and they were all far away from where we were sitting. Our server was nice but a little overwhelmed with his section, I ended up having to go to the bar for a drink before the happy hour special ended. Annoying but definitely not a deal breaker for me.

Hosted a business dinner for 35 and was looking for something casual with local feel/flavor.  Wanted to be in an open space so folks could mingle and talk before sitting down to eat, and also wanted people to be able to order off a menu as opposed to being limited to 3-4 pre set selections (many places require this for larger groups).  The folks here were great to work with in advance and proposed 4 adjacent high top tables for our group.  We pre-ordered apps so we would have food ready and people could order drinks as they arrived and mingle for the first hour or so.  

We arrived and everything was set perfectly for us.  Loved the feel of the place - perfect for what we were looking for.  Casual, but on the upscale side, open and inviting.  Our tables were together toward the back and our apps including calamari, soft pretzels, artichoke spinach dip and sliders  were waiting.  Also waiting was an extensive and impressive craft beer list, well laid out by beer type and with an excellent selection, the majority of which were local Colorado craft beers.  The variety was excellent boasting an even ratio of porters and stouts to IPAs.  Seems like an easy one but way too many spots are IPA centric and don&#39;t realize that it is tantamount to telling red wine drinker that Pinot Grigio is their only choice.  

I was able to sample 2 locals (would have been more if it wasn&#39;t business), the Telluride Face Down Brown, and the New Belgium 1554 Black lager.  Loved them both; and the variety of beer, wine and signature cocktails ensured there was something for everyone.  

The apps were excellent and after about an hour of relaxed mixing with people moving about the tables to join different conversations, we sat down to eat.  

A very nice menu with a wide variety, but not so much that you start to wonder if they do any of it well.  I was struggling between 2 burger choices, the jalapeño pepper jack and the NW Pub, when cheery server suggested I just combine what I like from each and get a custom burger.  That I did and ended up with a Gorgonzola infused burger with grilled onions, bacon, arugula, horseradish cream and Tabasco onion straws.   Cooked a perfect medium it was absolutely excellent.  Between the 35 we probably covered most of the menu and the feedback from my entire group was excellent.  We had a few locals that had not tried the place before and immediately added it to their go-to list of places.  

Finally, the service throughout was fantastic.  We had 3 servers assigned to us and they were jumping to get drink orders, fill waters, and make sure everyone had what they needed.  When it was time to eat, the orders came out together for each table, which I know is a challenge with larger groups.  They all thanked us at the end of the meal for stopping in and it was just a great experience overall.  

Denver is a frequent stop and this will be on my frequent stop list when in town.  I have a feeling my local team will be spending a lot more time there as well :)."

Definitely go for the adobo Benedict, it is extremely tasty. I would return to brunch just for this dish! We went around 9:30 and got a table easily, which is nice when most brunch places in Denver end up at a 45min wait. I did not try the coffee because they didn&#39;t do any espresso. My wife had their mimosas and said they were decent. All in all a good experience and worth re branching at."

My love and I decided to head over to check the place out (had a Groupon) before we move out of the area, as we will likely avoid coming here otherwise. 

Let me just say that before we decided to go out for dinner, I was happy thinking about grilling my salmon at home. Then he planted the idea of a juicy burger in my head, and well, my plans soon went down the hole and off to Thirsty Lion we went. I was on a mission!

The service from start to finish was very good. Quick, efficient, and friendly. I had the Tavern burger - yes, do get it. Burger sauce, cheddar, onion rings, and pepper bacon, galore. It was everything my stomach never knew it wanted. And I thought I just wanted a simple cheeseburger- HAH. It was perfectly cooked, juicy, greasy, yet tasteful. My only complaint is that it was almost too juicy, so the bun got a little bit soggy, but my hungry brain tells me that&#39;s just the flavor penetrating through. :D 

My hubs got the fish and chips and he was quite happy with his meal. The fish were perfectly cooked, not overdone at all. The breading was crispy and crunchy. 

Upscale bar food for sure, but well made and tasty.
Another perk is that they have pretty decent drink list, from the beer selection to the cocktails (they even have the classics!). Looks like they have a pretty good looking HH menu too. 
I would definitely come back if in the area (though like I said, I would avoid cherry creek at all costs if possible, but that&#39;s another story). Anyway, I give it a stamp of approval!"

The service was so slow. The food came out cold. I asked for ranch and they brought me horseradish sauce (twice). 

It&#39;s in a wonderful location in Cherry Creek North so the expectations are high. 

For not, let&#39;s just blame the problems on this location being fairly new. The location downtown is substantially better than this one."

I have eaten at the one downtown several times before. It is only because that I have had several different items off the menu at the downtown location that I give this one 4 stars. First, the atmosphere is great. It has a high end pub feel. The appetizers that I had both struck out...but I won&#39;t hold that against them. First I tried the chicken fingers and they were dry and chewy. They were so bad that I couldn&#39;t eat them so the bartender was great and she replaced them with sliders. Unfortunately, they weren&#39;t much better. The sliders also were over cooked. So...my conclusion? Hopefully they will catch somewhere in the training process that their kitchen is overcooking their food. I know they have great food...just not on this visit."

As with the downtown Denver Union station location- the layout is very spacious and decor fits perfectly into Cherry Creek.
Numerous large screen HD TV&#39;s for sport watching are easy to see from every seating vantage point.
Countless entree menu options are offered at a little smaller portion and reduced price for Happy Hours- (they have two- the 3-6pm and 9:30 - Midnight late night)
We sampled Fried Calamari, Bacon Cheddar Potato Cakes, Grilled Burger Sliders, Spinach Artichoke Dip and the Pepperoni &amp; Four Cheese Pizza.
Needless to say- that&#39;s a lot of food for two people snacking during Happy Hour!
The Bacon Cheddar Potato Cakes were stellar. I could eat my bodyweight in them daily. Perfectly fried crunchy on the outside and soft gooey cheesey at the same time on the inside. Served over Napa Slaw which was a great complement. The two dipping sauces provide some interesting flavour combo. Our favourite was the Chipotle Mayo Aioli - more spice than you&#39;d expect.The scallion herb sour cream can basically be described as just freeze dried Dill mixed with sour cream. Good but not as zippy as the Aioli.
Service was very good- plenty of staff helping each other out running drink orders and hot food to reach our table in a better than timely manner.

They have advertised NFL Specials of $4 Coors Light and $5 Bloody Mary or Mimosas.
Brunch has some very tempting menu options as well including Irish Whiskey French Toast!"

The dough was super soft and fluffy and the ingredients all seemed very fresh.  My husband had the fish tacos which were also flavored well and cooked to perfection.  We had a few drinks.  I loved the Blood Orange Rita.  It was a little sweet with just enough tangy.  We went for dinner another night with our friends.  We had the bacon wrapped dates which were perfectly caramelized and delish.  We also had the fried green beans which I am sure we could have ate two plates of.  They were flash fried to perfection.  My husband and I split the fish and chips which were the best I have had in the U.S. which speaks volumes because I feel like I have had them at several places that were supposed to be good.  They were super crispy and prepared exceptionally well.  I&#39;d highly recommend them.

It took a really long time to get drinks at this location. And slow everything else... It might be because we had a different waiter each time someone came up to our table... Our final receipt had two errors on it as well, and it took a long time to get an updated, correct bill. 

I can see why this place is sending out coupons for free apps and also has groupons... at least the food was hot and pretty tastey, not sure though if it was worth the trouble to get it."

We came back on sunday night for the second time and Erika M was our server. We ordered a bottle of wine and our server didnt even know you could order a bottle of wine let alone cork it and take it home. She came back and told us that we were able to cork it if we didnt finish it, then she came back to the table with a opened bottle of wine. I said &#34;is this bottle opened?&#34; she replied, &#34;yes, they opened it at the bar for me&#34; I was thinking in my head if this was a $100.00 bottle someone ordered and didnt get proper wine presentation then they would be PISSED! Do you not train your servers to open bottles? This should be a requirement, she didnt even know what bottle we wanted so she asked again what bottle it was. Then she came back again and said theres no button for a bottle for that wine and you guys dont sell it buy the bottle, so i showed her in the book, It was the (apothic red). She hardly came back to refill our waters throughout the whole night, we had to remind and ask her multiple times. We ordered edamame to start which we LOVED! we ordered another round of it and it was cold and dried up like it was sitting in the window for at least 10 plus minutes. We also ordered rice that was really mushy and not throughly cooked. The spinach did we replaced both these items with was really good. We will come back because we do enjoy the ambiance, food and atmosphere but please teach your servers a thing or two about wine and how to properly open a bottle at a table; extremely unacceptable!!"

The good--sliders and fries.
The not so good - Brussel sprouts. Lumpy and soft.
The bad--the manager&#39;s handling of a snafu with our fish and chips order.   My husband asked the waitress if the two pieces of fish was normal and she said it &#34;looked light.&#34;  She returned a few moments later with a bowl containing three more pieces of fish with no explanation.  The dish itself was fine -- nothing to write home about.  When we mentioned the episode to the manager, he became combative and defensive.

Yelpers told me to come here.  I was surprised and disappointed to find that this place closed at lunch (3pm).  Gheez!  I guess not tonight.

I remembered that the next day and called in an order for pick up with 8 minutes to spare.  They were nice enough to take my order, even though they were closing.  I walked ver and picked up my meal as they were shuttin&#39; it down.  I ordered pork ribs and brisket with fries and mac &#39;n cheese.  I discovered when I got home that I didn&#39;t get ribs, but pork shoulder.  Sigh.  I was hankerin&#39; for a rib, but at least the pork flavor sufficed.

The pork was tender.
The fries were deliciously seasoned, and had that delicious wimpy thing going on when you pick &#39;em up.
The shoulder came unsauced; they gave me two little canisters--perfect.
The brisket came half-sauced--like it&#39;s supposed to be.
The brisket could gave been more tender.
The smoke flavor emanated from the bag."

Being a BBQ fan myself, and being from out of town I had to try it out for myself to see if BBQ in Denver was any different from the BBQ we get out here in California. Just for fun I wanted to see if Tri Tip was really only a West Coast thing, and yes I can confirm it that Boney&#39;s does not serve Tri Tip (a bummer really as TT is pretty bomb.) 

My eating partner and I decided that we would split the 3 meat plate that included 2 sides and a slice of corn bread. For the meats we decided on brisket, pulled pork and rib tips with sides of baked beans and potato salad. 

The Meats:
- Brisket: Not fatty at all, had a nice bark to it and I really did like it. The slices were of a good size. Add a little sauce to it and it perks up real nice. 

- Pulled Pork: This was our favorite. Real nice flavor to it and it was not stringy like some of the other pulled pork I&#39;ve had in various places. 

- Rib Tips: Dry, dry, dry. Yet still pretty good. I can only imagine what these would taste like 

The Sides:
- Baked Beans: Holy smokes these are great! I wish we would of ordered a large tub of these as they were that good. Nice sweet flavor with nice smokey meaty flavors to it.

- Potato Salad: Super eggy, but not bad at all.

- Corn Bread: Meh, I&#39;ve had better.

Overall it was not a bad experience, there were some really great flavors here and we&#39;d probably come back if we are ever in town again. The decorations inside are real nice and there is nice feel to the restaurant."

First, the BBQ itself is excellent. I had the pulled pork sandwich, and it was fairly tender (but not the most tender I&#39;ve ever had), and had really good flavor. It was served on a nice, soft but somewhat small bun, and you have your choice of vinegar sauce, sweet sauce or hot sauce. 

That came with a side of BAKED mac and cheese. It was so, SO good. It had that delicious brown on the edges, but was delicious melted cheese on the inside. 

I also ordered the hush puppies, because, HUSH PUPPIES. They were ok, but I could taste the oil they were fried in, so, you know, meh.

Here&#39;s how the system works:

You arrive at the restaurant and then wait in line. The line eventually leads to a lone cash register. You place your order, she gives you a number, you sit down and wait for your food. 

However, this restaurant is having some problems:

1) Do not come here if you are in a hurry. As I mentioned, there is one cash register. ONE. There is one server. ONE!  We had a line 40 people deep at 11:35 a.m., and we were all standing in the hallway, spilling out onto the stairs we just came down, and are all staring at an empty restaurant, because no one had made it through the line yet. It&#39;s absurd.

2) Menus are clear up near the sole cashier, so you can&#39;t really peruse the menu until you are next in line, which is just not enough time. 

3) Most Denverites have only one hour for lunch, and that includes travel time. This restaurant has alienated most of the people who work downtown because of the way they have their restaurant set up. You cannot get in and get out in enough time to make it back to work.

I, too, had only an hour. After 20 minutes, I finally made it to the cash register. I started to give her my order, and she stopped me to ask me to repeat myself. Um, really? So I talked at a more Southern pace. I had to place it To Go because I now no longer had time to eat here. She took my order, handed me a number and an empty cup, and I headed for the beverage bar, which is also the barbecue sauce bar. For those of you who don&#39;t know, barbecue sauce IS STICKY. And yet, they have decided to place NO NAPKINS here in this location. Huh.

I made a trip to the restroom. OMG. The doors on two of the stalls don&#39;t even lock, so they won&#39;t stay closed. I&#39;m not shy, so I suck it up and use the restroom, only to discover AFTER I pee that THERE&#39;S NO FREAKING TOILET PAPER. So, what do the servers do? Do they bring their own napkins? And if they don&#39;t, do they just drip dry? Do they use their apron? Their HANDS? Disgusting. 

And then when I go to pick up my food, the only server there comes in off the floor, dips her hands in a disgusting silver food bin full of dirty water, shakes them off on the floor and on anyone standing near her, GRABS MY FOOD WITH HER DISGUSTING WET HANDS and hands me the bag of food. 

Um. Words cannot describe how gross that was. There is NO WAY that I am going to touch that grossness to get to my food.

So I ask her: &#34;Can I have a bag please?&#34; 

She hands me a plastic bag.

Me: &#34;Can I have a brown paper bag please?&#34;

I tear the wet part off the top of my food bag and transfer the contents to the clean, uncontaminated bag, and then run out of there as fast as I can. I will not be back until the owner pulls his head out of his or her ass.

PS: The place was full of white yuppies and hipsters. There was ONE black guy, patiently waiting for his food. I&#39;ll let you decide what all that means."

First thing first, it pains me to come clean as the people were so nice but, the tables were dirty, everything seemed a bit greasy and dirty and the worst part, someone pissed in the corner (by the bulletin board) where our booth was probably the night prior...I still am slightly throwing up in my mouth.

That being said, we were there around 1 pm. The food I am sure during some days is awesome but today, totally subpar.

Pork was moist and probably the best part of the three meat meal. Ribs were god but I bet were amazing when pulled out of smoker...whenever that was.

Despite the vagrant piss corner, I will be back one more time as my sub 4 star reviews always get a second glance...stay tuned..."

I arrived about 10 minutes before my bf did, and I didn&#39;t see a hostess stand when I walked in, so I went over to the cashier and asked the girl there if I should just sit anywhere. She kind of gave me a weird look and just nodded her head. So I sit down and proceed to get ignored for the next 10 minutes as I wait for my bf to arrive. My bf then shows up and we wait for another 10-15 minutes without any of the staff approaching us to bring us drinks or to even give us a menu. This is with servers waiting on tables right next to us, mind you. 

I finally get annoyed enough that I flag down one of the girls and ask her what we needed to do to get serviced. She apologized that no one had checked in on us - apparently we were not seated in her section, which is why she hadn&#39;t yet approached us. But she immediately brought us menus and told us that our server would be right with us. Our server was also the bartender it seemed like, and throughout the course of our meal, she was pretty tied up at the bar. So the first girl ended up being the one to take our order anyway. But throughout the course of our meal, I noticed that our server/bartender was waiting on other tables, so that people that sat down after us were getting their food before us. 

I place a lot of weight on customer service and I was pretty unhappy with this, so much so that I was planning on not leaving a tip at all. What turned my experience around was the food and the drinks. Their Bloody Marys are on point here. I asked for it spicy and it was perfectly so. We also got their platter to share, to try a little of everything and the food was amazing. Every single thing I tried was tender, juicy, and full of flavor. 

Be warned though - they give you a lot of food. I mean, A LOT. BBQ is filling enough as it is in small portions, but we had so much to go around. I&#39;ve never been in such a food coma as I was in that night. I physically felt sick for the next three hours, but the food was so good that I don&#39;t regret any of it. I would definitely come back next time I&#39;m in town, but I sure hope I get better/more consistent service next time."

It took us about 30 minutes before we go to the register.  My friend and I shared a two-meat combo with baked beans and coleslaw.  Also got their Strawberry Lemonade - yum.  Friend got a beer.

Pay at the front and take a number - they bring the food to you.  We didn&#39;t have problems finding a table.  Food took a while to come out.  They have a variety of sauces to choose from that you can pour in little plastic cups.  BBQ was good but not super tender.  I think some of the rib tips were a little overcooked actually, but their sauces were all pretty good.  And their baked beans were really good!  Had chunks of meat in it and such a savory flavor.  Cole slaw was decent.  I think people raved about the cornbread, and I thought it was good, but nothing to rave about.  Strawberry Lemonade was sweet and refreshing - it came in a huge mason jar, too.

It was enough food for the both of us.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d wait in line that long again for it, though!"

Being right off the shopping area next to the convention center downtown just doesn&#39;t seem like a successful formula for a good BBQ joint.  Well, I am so glad we checked it out!

We ordered a slab of ribs, rib tips, and brisket.  The ribs and rib tips were great.  They had a really nice rub, nice smoky flavor, and were juicy and tender.  The brisket was also good, but it came sliced and I prefer it chopped.  As for the sauces, they have a variety of sauces to choose from.  My favorite is the spicy vinegar sauce.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the employees are also really nice, and helpful!

The brisket was super tender, the way brisket should be if it&#39;s been smoked for a long time. The only thing I wished could&#39;ve been better for both was the smokiness from the meat.

Well I&#39;m so glad we finally came here! The staff, soo soo nice! Taking our order promptly, and checking up on us. Seriously some awesome customer service!

Now for the food. Yum! Yum! Yum! I ordered the Catfish &amp; Meat (brisket) with coleslaw and fried okra. Now, the Catfish was alright, batter was on the salty side for my taste, but the Brisket... And the fried okra. Wow! I think I could have eaten a whole basket of fried okra and been a happy camper! The coleslaw was fresh. I think I might try the collard greens next time I go. The kids loved the fried okra and their side orders of Mac N Cheese. My hubby got Rib Tips (his favorite) and 5 wings, along with fried okra, cornbread and Mac N Cheese. We also ordered a side of fries for the kids, but honestly, we had so much food, there was no need for the fries.

Wow. Definitely coming back again. Great BBQ, Sides, and Customer Service!!!"

The brisket was spot on. True perfection ! The hand cut fries were delish and the Brunswick stew was very tasty. 

We sat at the bar and enjoyed ice cold beer and a fairly big tv right in front of us.  The owners son (didn&#39;t get his name) was awesome. Very attentive and quick to get anything we asked for.  

If your staying in downtown Denver and have a hankering for top notch barbecue this is your go to place hands down. Thank you Boneys for a great BBQ experience in Denver Co. This Georgia girl hopes to return in the future !"

I would say that the brisket is better than the other major BBQ restaurant downtown because it&#39;s less dry. But the ribs and pulled pork aren&#39;t quite as good. The appetizers here are great. I recommend all of them.

The reason this place gets only three stars is the slow service. I&#39;ve been here three times, and it seems like they only have one cashier to handle everyone&#39;s order. This makes a relatively manageable lunch crowd end up waiting in line for WAY too long. Then they have food runners bring the food out, and the last time I was here it took 30 minutes to bring out my brisket sandwich. I&#39;m sorry, but it should not take that long to make a sandwich when the main ingredient -- the brisket -- was probably prepared and smoked the night before. Just cut it up, put it on a bun, throw on some &#39;slaw, and get that order out.

Generally, I&#39;m a fan of the food at Boney&#39;s. The location is much more convenient than the other major downtown BBQ joint, but the lack of service makes the convenience factor a wash at best."

Brisket
Wings
Rib tips
Baked beans with meat
Okra

Brisket was fantastic..perfect smoke flavor
Wings-best wings I have ever had! Love the crispiness of them...
Rib Tips- not good, chewy and gristly...would not order again
Baked beans-good flavor 
Okra-pretty good

Service was slow and it took awhile to get the food, I was shocked because it was not busy at all.  My water glass was never refilled, even after asking for more.

It was not the food that won&#39;t have me coming back, there was enough that I liked.  It&#39;s the service, I was not impressed at the lack of responsiveness to each table."

I ordered off a grub hub as I was working from home. The order took over an hour which isn&#39;t really an issue, but was delivered in a bag full off bbq sauce (literally everything covered in two open containers of sauce). All of the food was soggy and cold. I ordered the brisket meal with Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. Besides being soggy and cold the fries were under cooked and most of them still raw. The brisket was okay and the corn bread was inedible due to the soggy issue. I don&#39;t normally post bad reviews but when a shitty lunch cost me 23$ and some attitude from the grub hub delivery boy.... I gotta.  

I guess I should mention that my dog ended up having no issues with the fries and corn bread. Pretty expensive dog food tho :/"

We ordered the 2 meat platter with ribs and pulled pork and fried okra and sweet potato fries as sides. Although the ribs were a bit too charred for my liking, I really enjoyed the flavor of it and how it just falls right off the bone. The pulled pork was a little drier than I expected but still good with some barbecue sauce. The portions were great as well. We wanted to snack on this, but it was quite filling. The total came out to be ~15 dollars which was very reasonable. I would want to come back and try some of the other things on the menu.

The regular BBQ was good, but the Carolina Mustard was one of the best I&#39;ve had.  
The atmosphere was cool, they have a lot of decorations.  There was a ton of tables, so don&#39;t worry about not being able to find somewhere to sit.

This place is off-the-charts - literally and figuratively.  Off the charts AWESOME; and off the charts tucked away in the lower level behind and below a bakery and crazy staircase!  Worth the trip, so if you like outstanding BBQ - get there, now.  I had the Pig-A-Dilly sandwich, described as pork &#34;laced with fried dill pickles and a dabble of our kickin&#39; cole slaw.&#34;  Take a look at the picture - laced and dabbled my butt!  This stack of heaven between two absolutely delicious buns was loaded.  The meat was perfectly smoked and tender, and all meat - no fat or mystery chunks.  The cole-slaw was fresh, and not too runny, and not so cold that it decreased the heat of the meat and pickles.  The fried pickles were rings, and not over-battered, or so overpowering that the flavor of the meat is lost.  The bun - perfect and not too bready!  Tasted a little bit like a Hawaiian role - a bit sweet and yeasty.  This is a place where you order at the counter, and get a number.  I kid you not, by the time I got my drink and sat, the food was delivered to the table, and HOT!!!  There is a sauce on the table, but a variety of others that can be tried by the condiments.  The one on the table did it for me.  Packed just the right punch of BBQ, sweet and a little back-kick of heat.  I put it on my sandwich, then of course, dipped it in in too!  The place is clean, has a FINE selection of beers that I will be back to try later, and a true BBQ/southern &#34;vibe&#34; -  checkered tablecloths, pig, farm and license plate decorations.  The place was super crowded (not surprising) but surprisingly, not too loud!  The entire place was clean, and welcoming.  I had the mac-n-cheese side, and wasn&#39;t blown away, but who cares?  The fried okra is outstanding, and with 9 sides to choose from, I&#39;ll just try something else next time.  Oh, there will be a next time.  Maybe for dinner?

Whether you&#39;re looking for ribs, brisket, chicken, catfish, pulled pork or hot links - in Denver, this place puts all others, especially chains, to shame."

Location:
Lower level of a building near the entrance.  The restaurant offers both stairs and an elevator for an entrance.

Food: 
Well, might just get down to the food review.  I ordered brisket and potato salad.  The brisket had a meager helping of sauce on the meat and the meat was very overcooked.  The brisket was blackened on the outside and dry as a bone on the inside.  Rather puzzed how something could be overcooked in the morning.  Tons of salt on the food.  Would rather have s barbecue dry rub.  Not good at all.

Service:
Wait staff is completely lost.  We were directed to place an order at the checkout register, then didn&#39;t get helped due to the guy making orders.  Finally someone came over and asked us if we&#39;ve been helped then walked away also.  A third person came over then we placed an order.  No staff directed us to a table even though the couple that came in right behind us was taken to a table, seated and asked what they would like to drink.

Food was delivered to a random table we decided to sit at.  Staff did not deliver entire order and we had to go back to the counter to get it.

Overall, disappointing first time experience to which we will not return."

I was told that they don&#39;t do pick up and then you need to get in the same ridiculously long understanding that anyone who was just arriving has not ordered must use.

The sides!  Finally!  Someone gets it!  BBQ isn&#39;t just about the meat!  

Boney&#39;s has an excellent selection of both meats and sides, and they have many sauces to choose from (including my favorite, Carolina mustard-based).  I got the pulled pork and it was some of the best I&#39;ve had.  The mac n cheese (baked!) was excellent, the collards were a little salty (but still excellent), and the french fries were great!  The honey cornbread on the side just aided me in conjuring up images of BBQ places back home.

I was so excited after my first meal that I went back up to the counter and thanked the staff!  I am so happy to have finally found a BBQ place worthy of its Southern heritage!  My search is over!  And they have sweet tea!

You still grab a menu and walk to the cashier and order then take a seat and they bring it to you. 
The Prices have gone up as probably did their rent. 
The Portions have stayed the same.

Ordered Rib Tips and Potato Salad and Baked Beans. 
It was all Delicious so yes the quality has gotten better.
The Customer Service is great as it has always been. 
But they still dont give you enough Portions for what you pay. 
And the Rib tips on some of them had more fat then meat.

Likely the most courteous, genuinely friendly, prompt, and consistently good service I&#39;ve received in downtown Denver. I&#39;m a freak about good service. I approve heavily of this place.

Most importantly, though... The BBQ itself. So damn good. The brisket is amazing, the chicken supreme. All the sides I&#39;ve tried are really, really tasty. Collards with flavor. I&#39;m into it. 

You may miss this place the first time if you&#39;re looking for it. Past a dismal, failed, trophy-wife-run wine shop, and down a flight of stairs, you&#39;ll find it. Follow your nose, get some meat n sides. With a huge helping of incredible service. Get ye to Boney&#39;s."

Once seated, the young kid cleaned our table and was very friendly.  We patiently waited over 15 minutes and didn&#39;t even get water.  My girlfriend said multiple servers made eye contact with her and after another 5 minutes we left.  Almost a half hour with no service whatsoever.

Date of Visit: 6/7/2014

Boney&#39;s has quickly become my favorite BBQ joint in the Denver area, and one of the better BBQ places I&#39;ve had outside the deep South.

We stopped by for an early Saturday dinner and could not have been more pleased. Aside from a bit of confusion in finding the place (it&#39;s downstairs in a mall-type setup), Boney&#39;s hit this meal out of the park.

Dishes tasted included (meats - Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, BBQ Chicken, Southern Fried Catfish, BBQ Rib Tips), (sides - Forkin&#39; Good Potato Salad, Fried Okra, Baked Mac&#39;n Cheese, Hush Puppies).

The pulled pork was some of the best I&#39;ve had, the catfish was done perfectly, the brisket could contend with some of Texas&#39;s best (Stubb&#39;s), and the hushpuppies, a personal favorite of mine, are the best I&#39;ve had outside of the Carolinas.

Considering the prices, service, and product quality, Boney&#39;s is hard to beat."

I had the two meat platter with brisket and ribs twice, and the meat was great both times, lots of smoke taste and color, even on the ribs. Cole slaw was standard, but exactly what I wanted. Cornbread was standard. Mac and cheese salty but delicious. Fried okra crispy and interior not slimy! Fries would be the one skippable thing I had. I ate them all anyways though, so there&#39;s that.

One platter is enough for two servings if you have a small/medium appetite. Good variety of sauces for every taste - find them near the soda fountain.

It just about kills him to eat at a place that doesn&#39;t have a buffet and he&#39;s currently the duke of the Golden Corral in Centennial.  Not something I would be proud of, but he is!

We called before going and they said a huge party was coming in so we made reservations.  They seated us when we arrived in the section right below the stairs and promptly forgot about us.  It&#39;s an out of the way place and I think it was out of sight, out of mind.  We waited for 10 minutes and made 2 trips out to see if we should order from the counter or try to get a waiter to pay some attention to us.  Finally one of the guys from behind the counter came out to take our order.  I don&#39;t think they are setup for this as it took over half an hour to get our food, I&#39;m thinking you need to order from the counter and then go sit down.

The meat was tasty and fell off the bone with ease.  That&#39;s about the end of the good news.  All of our meals arrived cold!  The sides were not very goo.... actually they were awful. The hush puppies were very bland, the cole slaw was heavily mayonaised, the beans were OK, but the side effects an hour later were bad.

I am all for ambiance and experimental menus for a special night out. But I would eat at a place like Boney&#39;s that appeals to your carnal senses over the latest trendy bistro any day of the week. This is comfort food at its best. It hits the spot when you are hankering for some tasty barbecue in a low-key setting.

Boney&#39;s is located in a sprawling lower-level space. You almost feel like you&#39;re walking into a well-kept secret - if you blink, you&#39;ll miss the sign out front. I wouldn&#39;t describe it as divy though. Each room has its own feel, but the main dining area is laid out with lots of historic looking woodwork and plenty to look at on the walls.

Food is served in baskets and styrofoam and wrapped in tin foil. You order at a counter where the staff is in no hurry to rush you through the line (and the line can get long at lunch). 

And let&#39;s talk about the food. Oh sweet baby Jesus, the food. I always order the pulled pork sandwich combo, which comes with one side. The tender, spicy-sweet pork overflows onto a fresh and airy bun. I have it made Carolina style (topped with coleslaw). And the baked beans taste like they&#39;ve been slow-cooked for hours - rich in flavor and textured with bacon. The portion is way more than I should ever consume as a respectable Western woman, but I usually manage to inhale it anyway.

I love this place. It satisfies the senses. It&#39;s reasonably priced. It&#39;s authentic. And it feels kinda good to suggest this place to those friends who think they know all the hot spots in town."

And the sides..oh man..I could almost just eat a meal of them. Love their collard greens. They are smoky and moist and just lovely. Good crisp sweet potato fries and some baked mac &#39;n cheese that is basically just comfort in a bowl.

Seems almost impossible to believe, but on 9/23/16 I had my first ever memorably delicious meal in an airport! 

I was half waiting for the hidden camera crew tor run out the minute I took my first bite, my eyes growing wide with shock and delight at what I was tasting. This is not supposed to happen! Not in an airport. And most certainly not in an airport restaurant named after a retired football player. 

Alas, it happened.

Generally, when I&#39;m traveling on business, my favorite meal in an airport is bourbon. Airport food is so dreadfully bad and overpriced that if I do have to eat, I almost prefer to eat in a McDonald&#39;s as opposed to whatever sit-down restaurant happens to be taking up space in the terminal. And so, after arriving at Denver International Airport, I promptly sat myself down at the bar at Elway&#39;s and ordered lunch -- a rye Manhattan, up. 

The fact that they had Whistlepig Rye was the first sign that Elway&#39;s might be semi-decent. But when the bartender stirred and strained it properly, I knew I wasn&#39;t in just any ordinary airport restaurant. So I figured, why not take a chance on the food? 

I swung for the fences and ordered the &#34;Colorado 7X Waygu Burger.&#34; From the menu: a 7oz. handmade patty, cooked medium rare, topped with green chilies, melted Asadero cheese, and chipotle aioli. It actually seemed underpriced at $17.50, even with sides costing extra. 

Well, let me tell you something. This was probably one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. Definitely in the Top 10. Perfectly charred and crunchy on the outside, and pink and juicy on the inside. The flavor from the fat in the Waygu beef, which was perfectly salted, coupled with the chilies, cheese, and aioli was off-the-charts delicious. It&#39;s almost as if John Elway himself knew I was going to review his burger and personally made sure it was executed perfectly.

So if you&#39;re traveling through the Denver Airport and happen to find yourself in Terminal B, treat yourself to a stiff drink or three, and soak it all up with one of these amazing burgers. You&#39;ll be glad you listened to me.

(Now can someone please tell me WTF Asadero cheese is?)"

Appetizer: Grilled Artichoke ($14.25).  Excellent dish.  Perfectly grilled with a zesty Aioli dipping sauce.  

Entrees:
- Colorado Burger ($17.75).  We asked for the burger to be lettuce wrapped, and they accommodated the order.  Otherwise, nothing memorable about this burger--especially since it is $18! 
- Grilled Trout ($28).  The trout was dusted and darkened in a seasoning that was much too salty. Trout is a delicate fish, so the seasoning should not overpower it.  Sad.  

Side: Brussels Sprout Hash ($10). Very disappointing. It was not flavorful, contained very little roasted Brussel sprouts  and was more similar to an almond, Brussel sprout slaw. 

Service: Polite, professional, and attentive.  A highlight to this otherwise forgettable experience. 

Ambiance: Darkened woods and subdued lighting.  Pretty quiet considering it is on a busy Concourse B. 

Overall: Including a few cocktails, we spent over $170 for this meal, and it was not worth half that price.  There are better, more affordable options on Concourse B.  Sack Elway&#39;s!"

For an airport, the food is amazing. And even if you took away the airport label, it&#39;s still amazing. The steaks are prime, cooked perfectly, and have this amazing crusty rub (that you can buy too).

It&#39;s an airport steakhouse, so it&#39;s not cheap. But everything from the burgers to the bone in ribeye are on point. And sometimes I go for the home run and get the key lime pie (their best dessert by far).

I passed on the dressing which was just fine because with all of the bleu cheese they give you and the thick strip of bacon provides more than enough flavor!

I always go for the bacon cheeseburger because duh. It comes with two nice slices of bacon and all the extras you want - onion, tomato, lettuce, mayo, ketchup, mustard. I usually opt for fresh fruit as my side because there are always a lot of berries. On my most recent visit it had strawberries, grapes, blueberries and raspberries.

Yes it cost more but you get more and like I said before it is the best food in the airport. 

I have eaten at several Elway&#39;s restaurants and every single one has been awesome. So I was nervous coming into a place with a great reputation outside the airport to see what the airport version might be like. Surprise I was not disappointed.

Because of business I have had the opportunity to eat here several times. Each and every time it has been spot on!

It starts with service and they always greet you like they are truly happy to have you choose their restaurant. Once seated someone is there to take care of you very promptly. The bar service is also excellent.

No matter what time of day if you are in the airport this is the place to eat. Breakfast served fast and piping hot. Lunch time the salads are all good and the servings are the right size. Steaks forget about it... tasty cooked as order and the sides make a perfect meal.

There are two other things. I am from Kansas City so I fly Southwest out of terminal C and Elway&#39;s is in terminal B. Trust me get off the train and eat here before you go to terminal C.

That was one thing. The other is because I come from Kansas City I hate John Elway (Ok that is a bit harsh but hate in a fun sort of sporting way) and have a biases against his place to start with. He over came my negative outlook and made yet another winner."

The steak salad is really interesting - the steak is served separately, and there are tons of different flavors in the salad that my mind couldn&#39;t figure out what I was tasting (sundries tomatoes, onions, candied pecans, bacon...oh my!).
The only qualms I had were with the salad dressing (it was too liberal, even for me, and I love dressing) and the butter knife (I totally forgot that they can&#39;t serve steak knives in airports, which makes steak an interesting airport meal).

Bar service is quick and friendly.  Electrical outlets can be found under the bar at many spots.  The scotch and whiskey selection is pretty limited but the big brands are offered.  The menu is a mix of salads, steaks and seafood.  I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes.  The meat was tender but lacked a memorable flavor while the mashed potatoes had a great flavor but could have been served much warmer.  Prices are a little high but they are in line with this type of restaurant at other major airports.

On a short layover in the Denver airport, the hubs and I stopped off for a salad to combat the onslaught of cheese and beer from our weeklong stay in Madison. He ordered &#34;John&#39;s Salad,&#34; and I opted for my usual--the shrimp caesar.

I get it, it&#39;s in an airport. Things are expensive because their rent is expensive, and because they have a captive audience. They can charge me $8 for a $3 beer and I&#39;ll pay it. 

However, $10 to add shrimp to my salad is one thing (making it a $22 salad). But the other thing is that when the shrimp arrive there should be more than three medium-sized shrimp. And they should be perfectly cooked (not overdone). And while I know it looks &#34;fancier,&#34; not chopping my lettuce, giving me three (yes, I counted) croutons, and not tossing the uncut lettuce with the dressing just makes me annoyed. I did not order a DIY-caesar, and I certainly didn&#39;t order a $22 DIY salad. 

Given the above, the dressing is flavorful and the cheese is fresh and salty. The hubs enjoyed his salad (which is reasonably priced at $11), and the bartenders were friendly, attentive, and had the right about of rush about them considering you&#39;re dealing with folk who are usually short on time. 

But we really have to talk about those caesars..."

any who... elways is my reward for:

^  then a gas refill at that god awful gas station that has way too many cars trying to fill up and worst exit/entrance for the amount of traffic in and out of there,

^  lugging your suitcases thru a parking lot (either in the heat or snow), 
^  throwing your luggage on the shuttle bus, 
^  checking bags in (paying $25+), 
^  going thru that long arse security line i mentioned earlier
^   and then wait to get on to the shuttle/train to your terminal, where no doubt someone will cut right in front of you no matter where you stand

i get up those escalators, go directly to the hostess.  ask to be seated at the tables along the outside... they&#39;re usually always accommodating.  i sit down and my waiter greets me as he fills my glass up w/filtered water.  &#34;do you need a minute or would you like a drink now?&#34;

Elway&#39;s creates as stark contrast to the world of usual airport fare by delivering top quality fare in a warm, upscale environment (not withstanding the ubiquitous TV placement, with a nod to the owner&#39;s sporting background). 

While salmon was available, it is not native to the Rockies, so I clung to my adage of &#34;eat what you&#39;re near&#34; and went with the trout. Coupled with a Manhattan and asparagus (consumed quite separately, I assure you), I was more than impressed and resistant to the final sip of water that would surely cleanse my pallet. 

You will pay to taste such quality, but life is too short to settle for poor food...even in an airport. 

Bon appétit!

Tip: Walk strait to the bar seating and bypass the hostess (if seating allows). Speed of service increases commensurate to eye contact ;-)"

I had an amazing shrimp cocktail complete with four sauces. The shrimp were moist, plump and massive.   Their horseradish sauce was appropriately spicy. I loved it. 

I had the 8oz fillet for my main course along with asparagus.  The steak was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had: perfect temperature, well seasoned and not over salted.  I had no trouble cutting through it with the TSA approved knife.   The asparagus were average sized but nicely crisp, evenly seasoned and not overly oily.  

The staff was professional courteous and conscious of the fact that I had a flight to catch. Two thumbs up!

Great wine selection and spirits on the shelf.  

Overall 5/5. If I&#39;ve got some extra cash to treat myself to a nice lunch, I&#39;ll be heading back on my next connection."

What was most disappointing is that all sides are a la cart and will set you back a minimum of $9 each. My watery broccoli with some seasoning was not worth that price.

Both the hubby and I had a burger. I had mine with the green chili slaw (interesting concept and was actually yummy) and the hubby with the Colorado burger and chips. The burger was so juicy and had a nice char on the outside for flavor. One of the best burgers out there, I think."

I typically don&#39;t care for or flock to famous athlete owned restaurants, for the same reasons I would not wear or buy sports jerseys.  They typically lack style and only make the rich and famous athletes wealthier.  So you may ask, what am I thinking stepping into this place?  It&#39;s as simple as convenience and the restaurant being the most lavish for its airport location.

When I approached, I was immediately greeted by the hostess with politeness and professionalism of a Michelin rated restaurant, a great start indeed.  This being an airport location and having an upcoming flight, I was hoping for a momentary wait.  The place was very busy, but few minutes later, as quoted, I was seated.  To my surprise, the decor and ambience was lavish and contemporary with a touch of Colorado earthiness.  Although the restaurant had televisions, they only permeated the bar area, maintaining the contemporary ambience throughout.

The service was professional, attentive and efficient.  From what I observed, this place operated like a sports team&#39;s playbook, which is a necessity for a restaurant at an airport.  Everyone seemed to move around with a purpose.  I placed my order and before I could check in on Yelp, my dish arrived.  

I was craving a healthy and light dinner, so I decided on Tyler&#39;s Ahi Salad and a glass of German Riesling.  The salad encompassed ingredients typically used in fine dining, including: seven spice rare grilled Ahi tuna, mizuna, haricot vert, tomatoes, carrots, edamame, radish, garlic-soy roasted shiitake mushrooms and was garnished with chili-lemon vinaigrette.  The salad was very colorful visually and in flavor with the Ahi grilled to perfection.  The variety of ingredients gave the salad character and depth.  However, the dressing did not meet my expectations with regards to its piquancy, as the chili was subtle in warmth.  A touch of freshly ground pepper remedied the taste.  Having pepper and sea salt grinders at each table was a rare touch.

I was delighted and thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant.  I think Elway scored a touchdown with this place.   There are other locations in the Denver area, which I&#39;m sure are even more opulent.  Hopefully I have time to spare on my next flight in Denver, so I can explore the less healthy items on their menu."

I love many of the menu items. My favorite item is the Lollipop Lamb Chops. The burgers are amazing, and all of the appetizers are amazing. The steaks have an amazing flavor and are always cooked perfectly. They will even make the Lollipop Lamb Chops during breakfast if you ask for them. Even though it is in the airport, the restaurant has a very classy setting. It is the best restaurant in DIA."

Named after that guy who runs car dealerships, it offers class and price that you would be used to at the Cherry Creek location. It also offers all of the flowery man shirts, loud cell phone calls, and people looking to find celebrities that you would ever want.

While that atmosphere ranks a strong 2.5, the food is a strong 4 star. The burger was delicious, and actually worth the $6 premium on other similar beef-based patty meals. The burger is a-la-carte, so you could spend much more. Definitely not a place for a person on a budget or a non-business trip. The bartender I had was great; very friendly and excellent service.

Oh how I wish that business people of varying shapes and sizes did not like good food, and didn&#39;t have to announce their success to the world. Because Elway&#39;s would be the best place to go for food in DIA."

I am constantly stuck working, so I have to order takeout for my delicious dessert. The downside is, it is a Russian roulette of how the chef decides they&#39;re going to package it for me. I&#39;ve ordered the creme brulee four times, two times they have let me borrow the ramekin, and the other two times it came in a soup cup and just all in a clear pastry box. If done right, there is an equal amount of carmelization that is blended well with the custard bottom. Sometimes, I&#39;ll receive fruit that is accompanied with it, and sometimes, I won&#39;t have any. 

Just a heads up it&#39;s about $10 plus tip. I think I better head to Root Down for lunch instead..."

After having bad experiences at several other places at DIA, I gave Elways a try, getting the cheapest thing on the menu - Chili. I must say, even for about $10, they could charge more for this as it was one of the best Chili&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had.

With the help of my Yelp app, I decided that Elway&#39;s was the place to check out! 

I travel quite a bit, and usually I am less that impressed by airport food. I get it, when you travel your basically a captive audience which leads the way for typically mediocre fare, not the case at Elway&#39;s! 

Right after I was sat, a table near me had just received their entree - a big juicy cheeseburger with two slices of thick cut bacon and a basket of some pretty delectable looking shoe string french fries! I knew right then and there that I had not only made the right choice dining at Elway&#39;s but that I HAD TO HAVE THAT BURGER! 

So the waiter came and I ordered my burger, med rare with fries on the side and a bloody mary! 

So out comes my Bacon Burger with white cheddar cheese and two beautiful thick pieces of bacon so delicately placed on top, served on a fresh brioche bun. The burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed every single bite of this juicy piece of I may need a cardiologist after I eat this heaven. Fries were delectable and their bloody mary was top notch! 

Keep in mind though, that for a top notch burger such as this one - it&#39;s going to cost you, $16.50 for the burger and an additional $2.50 for the fries. So your looking at a $20.00 burger/fries combo and a  $14.00 bloody mary, this place isn&#39;t exactly cheap.

Elway&#39;s proved to me that not all Airport restaurants are created equal. So if your looking for a topnotch meal while being a sitting duck at Denver International Airport this is your spot!"

I ordered a medium-rare New York steak.  The steak was well-prepared, but the price for the steak was over-priced (especially since the steak was small and it was served a la carte).  For the price of the steak, it would be reasonable to expect an additional &#34;something or other&#34; to accompany my meal, such as a simple serving of inexpensive bread and butter.  After I finished the steak, I was still really hungry.  So, I went to another bistro and ordered a turkey sandwich.  For those reasons, I rated Elway&#39;s as a 3-star restaurant.  On the other hand, the waitstaff at Elway&#39;s was professional and courteous - so the waitstaff deserves 5 stars."

Being from Kansas, I must say Ophelia&#39;s lives up to the &#34;Kansas City Barbeque&#34; name.  The pulled pork is incredibly moist and tender with great smoky flavor.  The pineapple chicken has great flavor and is incredibly juicy.  I&#39;ve tried the brussels sprouts, potatoes, and onion rings, and they have always been quite good.  

The owner seems to enjoy making barbeque, and he said he was from Kansas City (Go Chiefs!).  He serves up very generous portions.  If you&#39;ve never been, just let him know and he will be happy to offer you a free sample.  I try to track him down for lunch whenever he posts up downtown (usually around 17th and Lawrence or Larimer), and if you work downtown, you need to check it out next time you see the Ophelia&#39;s truck.

I had the buffalo philly which was really good. It came with a&#39;jus to dip it in which was surprisingly good. My wife had the steak salad and loved it!  Steak was done really well and really flavorful. 

The service was quick to refill the drinks and didn&#39;t leave us waiting for anything. Sitting on the back patio on joining the view of the course was great on a hot day. Overall, very good just needs a little bit bigger menu selection."

On the recommendation of another family member, who lives in Reunion, my sister and I decided to look into this location to possibly host an event. We arrived almost an hour early for our meeting with the manager and decided to sit out on the patio and have drinks to pass the time. To begin, the hostess did not actually show us to a table but just opened the door to the patio and did not say anything - when we made our table selection I turned and saw her roll her eyes as she made an exaggerated sigh. We did not receive a menu when seated. A few minutes later our waitress came around a corner and complained to her coworker that she had been seated with another table, loud enough to hear across the back patio.

When the manager arrived for our meeting he was quite friendly and kind, I can only comment positively on the interaction we had with him. Once we had finished our drinks he gave us a tour of the building and after, we needed to close out our tab. When we went to do so, that same waitress barely engaged with us and was visibly annoyed when we paid in cash and needed change. 

I cannot recommend this restaurant and could not imagine having an event being hosted at this location with the same staff who served us today. I do not appreciate being made to feel as though I am an inconvenience."

I like the happy hour and most of the staff. Some servers are not very attentive but some are.  The black &amp; bleu salad is my favorite and special occasion brunches are pretty great too, but not once have they updated the menu and with it being the only American dine-in place in town, it gets old after a while. I would love to see some creativity and maybe even seasonal offerings.  I&#39;ve had a few terrible experiences too and the restaurant doesn&#39;t care. One time I ordered an appetizer that was still frozen in the middle, the server was like &#34;oh&#34; but didn&#39;t comp the cost nor fix it.  The last straw was Saturday night Prime Rib special. I&#39;ve had it before and it was wonderful; however, this particular night I sent it back 3x and ended up just eating the cold baked potato. I asked for it to be &#34;medium rare, like pink&#34;. The first time it came out brown- yuck! The second time it was rare, purple and the 3rd it was medium. If it truly is prime rib, cut the center pieces where they are more likely to be MR. This experience taught me they are prepackaged pre-cut prime ribs and the kitchen is not cooking them properly. Then the &#34;chef&#34; comes out to argue with me about how I ordered it.  I always order it MR and I know it&#39;s pink. For goodness sakes I have raised beef all my life! I haven&#39;t been back and won&#39;t.  They have some things to fix before I wooly ls consider eating there again."

They do have tables and a menu, but they didn&#39;t have anyone to meet and seat you.  Once you get the menu, it is primarily sandwich-based bar food (hamburgers, wraps, and sandwiches).   The food is better than fast food, but you could get the same thing in most any American food restaurant.   Once the waitress knew I was there, she did a good job of getting the order, though she seemed a bit unsure of a couple of things when I asked questions, so perhaps restaurant waitress was secondary to being the person that brought drinks to the people in the bar area.
There were several people there stopping in for drinks and a chance to relax and catch up, so this place may just be the local bar for Reunion and people don&#39;t actually eat there.   I know that at one time you could get a steak or other entrees but seems they are reduced to just sandwiches now (at least, that was all that was on the menu that I was looking at on a Monday night).  Since I was the only one there that ordered food, it was  a pleasant surprise that the food came out fairly quickly and seemed to properly prepared.
This place might do better if you tried to reserve it for a group.

PROS:  Convienent location if you live in Reunion; nice view of the golf course (if you like a treeless, praire golf course); reasonable service; reasonable price, reasonable speed on cooking 
CONS: Not sure the restaurant side is taken seriously

Bottom line: As a bar, the place was great.   As a place to get a steak, nope.  But a much nicer place than a McDonalds."

I have been hanging out at the Bison Grill for almost 2 years and have always had great experiences.  The staff was friendly, the food was good and you could always expect the best dining experience for miles around.  In the past several months something has really changed here.  The food has gone really, really south.  Dripping wet Nachos, dry chicken and exceptionally over cooked burgers are have now replaced the once cared for menu.  The &#34;executive chef&#34; spends most of his time out in the bar talking to the staff and none of the conversations are about how to make the food better.  People in civilian clothes stepping behind the bar to grab a drink and the staff all sitting and standing around while customers wait to be served are just a few of the behaviors to let you know that whomever is in charge has just let this place go.  If you are the manager, bring back the prior waitresses and talk to your chef- You will begin to lose local business otherwise."

From the drinks to dessert menu, you probably  can&#39;t tell what the dishes are from their names but the descriptions under each dish is pretty clear, so don&#39;t worry. 

We tried their popiah and we loved it. It was a little spicy and tasted very authentic. The char kway teow (pan fried flat noodles in dark sweet soy sauce with scrambled eggs and Chinese sausage) was up to standard too. The only dish I was disappointed with is the laksa, which is curry noodles. The noodles were undercooked. As for desserts, their kueh dar dar tasted exactly like what I get in Malaysia. It&#39;s basically a sweet crepe wrapped with grated coconut soaked in palm sugar. 

Lastly for people who knows what teh Tarik is, they serve it there and the staff actually knows how to pull the tea. We didn&#39;t order it because we assumed that the American servers didn&#39;t know how to pull it but someone else ordered it and we watched him did his thing at the bar.

Ok so,,,
They serve a traditional dinner served when guests come to their homes back in their country. My friend seemed to enjoy this dinner more than I.
I liked the Crunchy anchovies but how many can you eat?
The nuts served with this traditional plate were not candied or cooked in anyway so I just didn&#39;t get it. The meat that comes with the traditional plate in our case was beef, I really couldn&#39;t get into the flavor as well, yet I took another couple bites trying to get anything out of it to explain to all you yelpers. Who knows, maybe by then I had to much wine. 
The lamb that I was served that was wrapped in a dough and was FANTASTIC.  the lamb melted in my mouth.  The menus is small so it&#39;ll be easy for you to find out what this dish is called, because I can&#39;t remember the name of it.

I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on Malaysian cuisine, as Makan stands as the first instance in which Malaysian vittles have passed through my eating hole. As such, going to Makan I had, literally, no idea what to expect. Throughout the time that I spent at Makan I was very pleased. The interior of the restaurant is small but comfortable. Diners will be sitting on small stools, eating off of (or at least drinking from) Ikea dishes, in fairly close proximity to neighbours. All in all, this gives Makan a very homey atmosphere (homey as in, &#34;Oh, hi Grandma,&#34; not homie as in, &#34;What up G,&#34; although that, too, would make for an interesting dining experience). 

Upon trying to describe the food that I ate (which feels like it was about half the menu) the best that I can offer is, unlike anything I&#39;ve had before. The food looked familiar, some dishes vaguely Chinese, other dishes appearing to be drawn from India or Southeast Asia. Familiar looks, however, did not correspond with a familiar taste. The flavours, the spices, the smells- all had a uniqueness that I had not previously encountered. Everything that I ate was good (some great), and entirely new. This is among the highest praises that I can offer to a restaurant: The food was memorable. On top of this, the service was top-notch, and the staff were both friendly and helpful. 

I would (and have) highly recommend Makan to those looking for some adventure (if you will forgive a very loose definition of the word). For those who have been across Denver, sampling the best of what our town has to offer, Makan exists as something thus far unexplored. Give it a try."

We ordered a variety of dishes which I unfortunately can&#39;t remember the names of. All the dishes were pretty small so I recommend ordering a variety and sharing. Everything we ate was great! One dish had rice, eggs, nuts, dried anchovies, and some sort of paste that was suuuper great.

Fantastic...but for those who may be sensitive to strong and/or unfamiliar tastes, be sure to get a recommendation from the staff for something on the milder side to ease in. There are some intense dishes.

I particularly love the Nasi Lemak and the Sambal Udang. The Laksa is great on a cold night. But really, everything&#39;s great.

I tried the roti prata/canai with 2 dipping sauces (curry chicken sauce &amp; dhal curry), a curry (kari ayam with chicken, potato &amp; coconut milk), the curry with vermicelli noodles (laksa) &amp; the potato curry puffs

CONS
-service is timely but the food takes a long time to come out because there are only 2 people in the kitchen. People who ordered after my table got served their food before me and people who were sitting in the restaurant well before us were also waiting for their food for a long time. I think they need to hire more chefs
-short on menus- I wanted to keep a menu to myself to look @ while I waited for the food but the server had to take it away because they didn&#39;t have enough (the restaurant is really small so I&#39;m surprised they just didn&#39;t make  more menus) 
-you&#39;ll leave the place smelling like food because it has an open kitchen that&#39;s really close to the dining quarters, the smell of raw fish sauce will be in the air and will be evaporating from the pan
-worst roti I have had. Roti is my all time favorite Malaysian dish and I&#39;ve had it plenty of times before. It is usually greasier and more gluttonous and is also usually served with a coconut curry. The sauce they had for this roti was more cinnamon/spice-ish rather than coconuty. The roti itself tasted like the dough used for the potato curry puffs
-lanterns had bugs in it  
-they don&#39;t take American Express

PROS
-they have specials each day. Sunday was family meal day so they offer preset meals/plans for slightly discounted prices (we calculated how much we&#39;d save if we went with the family meal vs. ordering a la carte and it was only a couple of dollars)
-they have happy hour
-fresh flowers on the table
-cute decor (but everything&#39;s from IKEA including the plates, forks, chairs, lanterns)

This is the only Malaysian restaurant I&#39;ve tried in Denver so I don&#39;t know if better ones exist. I&#39;ve only eaten at Malaysian restaurants in the bay area so I don&#39;t know how to judge this place accurately. All I know is that the food was ok okay but I&#39;ve had more satisfactory Malaysian food before."

We had a wide variety of dishes. 
We started with curry puffs - flaky crust but curry flavor was not evident, satay both chicken and beef - meat was over cooked, anchar - pickled and spicy raw vegetables which we all loved, and pork and shrimp wontons - flaky but not interesting.
Then we had Mee Siam and Nasi Goreng. Both were flavorful. Tofu was over cooked. 
We ended with a beef and a chicken curry, coconut rice and roti - a fried flatbread. This was worst course. Meat chunks were over cooked with very little flavor. Chicken pieces were like biscuits, dry and crumbly. Roti was greasy and depended on sauces for flavor. 
Service was atrocious due to understaffing. We only had original water at table which was never refilled, the wait for each course was very long, had to wait long time to order more drinks as waitress was not to be found and when we asked for clean plates between messy courses we were told that they didn&#39;t have enough to give out more. 
This place needs some management consulting to fix what&#39;s broken."

I am biased because I am a lover of Malaysian, Indonesian and any other type of food from this part of the world so if you are not a food adventurer such as myself, this may be outside of your comfort zone.

My husband and I ordered take-out, which is a good test for a new restaurant as it shows me how well 1)the food travels and 2) the food tastes because it&#39;s not always about presentation. Anyone who&#39;s eaten at a food cart on the streets of Thailand will testify to that!

We shared three things:
Popiah - sort of like a spring roll but way sexier
Murtabak - flatbread filled with meat, cabbage, egg and red onion served with two dipping sauces
Kari Ayam - chicken curry for you not Malaysian speaking folks

Wow!!! First, there was plenty of food for the two of us. In fact, we ate it all because it was so good despite being totally stuffed. Second, the flavors are what really makes me love this part of the world so much. They have such amazing flavors! Really indescribable so sorry for not providing you more data. Just go and have some, experience a whole new world of taste right here in little ol Denver!

I&#39;m not going to tell you about each dish. They were all amazing. Done."

First, the restaurant does look clean and well attended. It is trying too hard to be trendy, only ends up with uncomfortable chairs and tiny tables.

We ordered the Satay, beef rendang, and roti. The Satay was good, but the peanut sauce is very watery. The rendang was well marinated, but there is no hint of sweetness as expected. Instead it was overwhelmed with spices. We love the spices - but without the sweetness, it simply is not rendang. The Roti was the highlight of the meal. The curry sauce was great. Too bad the roti is uncooked in the center. 

Overall, I think we caught them on a bad night. It happens. We will be stopping by again. Until then, it&#39;s a meh."

The menu is pretty solid with a ton of interesting choices the recall Thai cuisine, but also Asian dishes I have never encountered before. Like, my entree, Char Kueh Tiao: Flat rice noodles stir fried with soy sauce, a hint of chili, Chinese sausage, shrimp, egg, bean sprouts and chives. First off - Chinese sausage is delicious with a complex, almost smoky, flavor. And along with the hint of chili...even more yummy. Similar to Pad Sew Ew, but with just a different kick of spices and protein. 

Their happy hour selection is also pretty enticing with an array of shared plates of small Indian inspired bites. Mini Laksa Bowl and Roti Prata/Canai to name a few. To top it off - wines are $1 off and beer is $3 per bottle. Not a bad deal. Not a bad deal, indeed! In conclusion - I am thinking I am a fan of Malaysian food."

We got the eggplant curry dish which was very good and the roti with lamb which was amazing. If you come please please try the roti. I had never had one before and it is hard to explain but boy was it delicious.

Don&#39;t listen to the other reviews about slow cooking time or bad service. We only had &#34;the one server from the bar&#34; and he was very attentive and clearly explained that one of the dishes we ordered was made fresh and would take about 20-30 min."

Samantha does a great job making you fee at home and the open kitchen leaves everything in plain sight to see them making your dish using fresh ingredients. 

Fantastic happy hour that includes some well known wines.  My last dish was the eggplant with coconut rice which i will recommend to anyone.  It was so good it took me by surprise.

We weren&#39;t disappointed. My favorite dish is Beef Rendang which is like a coconut curry stew. The sauce was nicely balanced and you could cut the beef with a fork it was so tender.
We also had Achar which is a bowl of pickles with peanuts and a spicy sauce. My wife had a Veggie version of Nasi Goreng which she really liked.
We had veggie curry puffs for an appetizer.

It was way understaffed and the owner looked like she had woken up on the wrong side of bed, every day, for the past 30 years. The food took AGES to come out and even then, it was expensive and nothing great. People who arrived later were served earlier and the owner would prepare take out orders before serving the customers she had who were waiting for more than an hour. I will never more come to such a poorly run restaurant and I highly discourage anyone from patronizing this place that they have the audacity to call a &#34;restaurant&#34;.

After three recent trials, Makan is quickly becoming one of my go to restaurants, and I seem to be rolling in here on Sunday nights often, sitting on the patio, chowing down....

Tonight we tried the Sunday Night Family Supper for 2 which included Satay (4), Curry Puffs (2), a full serving of chicken curry, Fried Rice, and a roti.  OH MY GOD WAS THIS A GREAT CHOICE!!!  We ate every morsel and it was a lot of food.  Delicious!  

Cute, clean establishment on way South Pearl. Fabulous staff, friendly! 

Try the pulled black tea and watch them &#34;pull&#34; it!  Delicious!On

Our first visit do not go so well a few years ago: I had the sauteed water spinach with coconut rice, and the tabled ordered the spicy shrimp in tomato paste and the fried rice. We tried the spring rolls up front and they were super strong. The group was not happy.  These items do not seem to be on the menu any more and everything we have had recently is excellent!  Bravo!"

Despite my &#34;friendly reminder&#34; to my lovely Singaporean friends, they still wanted to go to Makan Malaysian Cafe... well, on that faithful day of Wednesday July 11th 2012 for dinner.  Time was about 18:00hrs ish.

When we arrived, we were seated promptly.  There are like 2 other couples dining in.  We were given the menu.  My friend A.W decided to have the Teh Tarik Halia ($3.25), both N and I decide to have water as part of our beverage.

The items that my friends ordered were :

*  Popiah $4.50 for 2 Popiahs

*  Curry Puffs ($4.50/2 pieces)

*  Nasi Lemak ($9.95)

*  Sambal Eggplant ($9.95)

As for me I opt for the Roti Telur ($7.95) with Dhal.

YES, our food came out promptly.  We were surprised by the outcome of the Popiah.  Its more the &#34;FRESH&#34; kind, rather than Fried Kind of Popiah, we are used to.  Even the Popiah looks so pale.  The dipping sauce that comes with this &#34;Fresh&#34; Popiah is sweet and spicy soy sauce with chopped peanuts.  The dipping sauce alone reminds me of a &#34;touch&#34; of somekind of Hoisin sauce.

The Sambal Eggplant, was slightly sweet rather than spicy.  YES, it contain Belacan as part of the ingredients to cook this dish.  Nothing stellar, nothing &#34;WOW&#34; about this dish either...

I am A-OKAY with the Roti Telur,  I guess that was the highlight of my Dinner that evening.  But the Dhal was DEFINITELY a letdown due to &#34;watered&#34; down Dhal, so I ask our server if I could have the Chicken Curry ($2.50) as a side, for my Dinner.  Still, the portions are too tiny for my personal tastebud.  Still hungry... *Sad Face*

After our dinner, even my friends told me, they experienced better in terms of the amount of food, and for the pricing is a little bit higher.  They can understand the reasons why.

Karen, I really really want to support your business.  I hope and wish Makan Malaysian Cafe, the success of your business venture for the long run.  Coz running a restaurant Is Definitely NOT an easy task.  There are DEFINITELY room for improvement in terms of portion and pricing for Makan Malaysian Cafe.  Perhaps my standards of Malaysian Cuisine is DEFINITELY High.

Gonna tell you upfront: have not been to Malaysia yet and haven&#39;t really had Malaysian food before. So, there&#39;s nothing to compare Makan to at this moment.

I&#39;ve heard differing opinions about Makan from friends, colleagues. One is that the price is too much for too little food. I can see that being an argument; however, the way I see the situation, is that there aren&#39;t other Malaysian restaurants in Denver to compete with. Makan can charge a premium on their food if they&#39;d like. Also, I felt the portions were just right for me -- no supersizing needed.

I went to Makan on a Thursday night; the place was empty when I arrived, but then...suddenly...the crowds started arriving after me. I guess I&#39;m a people magnet in that way.

Since my friend was raving about Makan to me, I figured I&#39;d try one thing off of each part of the menu. Why not do a tasting hm?

First, I had the popiah: unique soy sauce dip and the popiah was just the right texture. No crispy &#39;spring roll&#39; skin here; just good, rice papery flavor encasing a flavor party.

My entree was the roti with the vegetarian curry. I love using my hands for foods like this; roti is to curry as naan is to curry as pita is to hummus. There. The roti was eggy, easy to pull apart. I could have had a second helping of roti, but I opted instead for a side of coconut rice, which was probably the best value on the menu (big bowl of coconut rice = $2 roughly).

I had a pulled milk tea and some of the glutinous rice balls for dessert. Hell, I love glutinous rice balls. Be careful though; these can squirt out too quickly.

I suppose what makes some people complain about Makan would be the layout, the ambience: the place is crisp and clean, but gives off the vibe of casual dining. So customers expect the &#39;casual dining&#39; pricing. If customers were looking for something faahncier, they&#39;d want that atmosphere to pair with the prices.

I only have one complaint: the hours. Please be open more during the day! Mondays and Tuesdays they are off...and usually I&#39;m in the South Pearl neighborhood one of those days. Sigh.

Well, I&#39;ll be back."

I was the only patron in the joint (that makes me nervous for the staying power of places) but didn&#39;t make me nervous to eat there. 

I had two glasses of red wine, Popiah appetizer &amp; Laksa. I enjoyed all of them. For the Laksa however I would stick to vermicelli noodles as opposed to egg or a mix. The egg noodles kind of overtook the soup. 

My final bill was under $20 and I was full and happy. The owner (I think she was the owner) was very kind and attentive.

I was craving Asian flavors and my husband and I decided to try this place out (made a reservation on OpenTable).  All I can say is:  YOWZA!  We loved it.

First -- we started with the curry puffs, siu mai (steamed dumplings) and achar (spicy pickled vegetables).  The puffs were light and flavorful, the dumplings were superb and we loved the tangy spice of the veggies.  Even my husband, who is usually deeply suspicious of cauliflower, chowed down on the achar.  I&#39;m not sure he even noticed the cauliflower.

For the main dish, I ordered the nasi lemak (coconut rice with fried anchovies, peanuts, boiled egg, cucumber and sambal) with kari ayam (chicken curry).  The server told me that the best way to eat it was to mix everything up together. It was fantastic. The sambal added just enough spice and tang, and the peanuts and anchovies gave a nice spicy crunch.  Don&#39;t be afraid of the anchovies! They are not too fishy!

My husband had the rendang daging (beef coconut stew) and I&#39;m pretty sure he liked it, because it was gone in about three minutes!  I tried a bite and the beef was incredibly tender and flavorful.

The Malaysian pulled tea -- teh tarik -- was a nice treat.  It&#39;s a lightly sweet hot tea that is poured back and forth to make a froth.  Kind of like chai, but not so many spices. It was perfect on this chilly evening!

Having never been to Malaysia, I can&#39;t judge the authenticity of the food; I just loved the flavors, and everything was very fresh.  Service was upbeat and efficient, and the restaurant is clean and modern.

I still have a little bit of nasi lemak left in a takeout container in my fridge.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m going to have it for breakfast tomorrow."

The (owner?) had an extremely angered/arrogant look on her face. I heard her muttering &#39;shit&#39; while preparing food.

Cute place.  Greeted nicely as we entered by the host.  He was pleasant and showed us to a table.  A very, very uncomfortable table.  I could hardly sit on the bench as It caused pain in my backside.  Waiter/host took our order and everything seemed great.  Menu read well and we were excited.  The food started coming out and was the smallest portion they could get away with serving.  Food was Just okay and not as wonderful as prior reviews had stated.  I make better peanut sauce at home and the  satay was as big as my pinky finger.  Nasi goreng was unimaginative and bland.  The roti was fine, not great.  At this point we could still be in for a second visit until we started seeing how the chef/wife of the Host/waiter treating him so poorly for all to see.  Small restaurant with an exposed kitchen you can see and hear everything.  She is the reason we will not be back.  She continually rang that damned bell at her  husband when he was 5 feet away from her and then proceeded to berate him in front of their customers.  A very mean person we will not give our business to again.  She knew that we were watching so she started shooting us with bad looks.  We feel sorry for the husband."

While consulting in Denver in 2012, I was rather surprised to find this place in Denver. Having been duped by another restaurant in the area for serving &#39;frozen&#39; roti canai, I wasn&#39;t expecting much when I first arrived. My first visit wasn&#39;t that great, the roti canai was not up to normal standards but it was definitely made on premise. 
Since it had just opened at that time, I decided to write to the owner and she invited me back to try again. She acknowledge that she had a not so great batch but promised to &#39;correct&#39; it on my return. I did return the next day and I was really happy that I did because the roti canai she then made was pretty good (so were the other curry dishes that I ordered)

I do like this place because it has items on the menu that you don&#39;t get at other Malaysian restaurants. I travel coast to coast for work and always make it a point to eat at Malaysian restaurants and this is by far the ONLY one I&#39;ve come across that offers Malaysian style desserts cakes. Its a huge risk because people might not like the taste or texture but I applaud her for serving it. (and also because I did enjoy the dessert items as they were &#39;true&#39; to taste).

Most M&#39;sian restaurants have a tendency to list other dishes that are not traditionally Malaysian to safe guard themselves just in case their patrons can order something they might be familiar with. This location which doesn&#39;t, is still around after 1.5 years, shows that they&#39;re still holding strong (on top of the fact that I think people in Denver are pretty open and adventurous enough to take on very different kinds of dishes that contain fermented shrimp and anchovies )."

We went for restaurant week.The waitress was good. The owner seems to have taken on too much.It is a small operation. It seemed a little rushed.
 The food was ok.They were a little stingy on the sauces. The desserts were not tasty. Maybe it is an acquired taste. The portions were the right size.i dont predict it being open forever."

No, wait - I&#39;m not trying to get in your business. See, the sentence I just uttered is in fact a popular greeting in many parts of the world - for example, in the Malay language, one might say &#34;Sudah makan kah?&#34; or something akin. Well, looky there - that ties in rather nicely with the subject of this review, the South Pearl Street gem Makan Malaysian Cafe.

An extension of Wee Bites (the catering service run by the ever-cheery owner, who hails from the southern regional capital Johor Bahru), Makan has flavors for every palate. Sip a bracing Teh Halia (frothy black tea with ginger) or an Aussie-style &#34;flat white&#34; coffee (with oodles of steamed milk) while you gaze longingly at the menu before you. Don&#39;t those Curry Puffs (flaky pastries stuffed with the chicken-potato concoction called Kari Ayam) look appetizing? Or for you folks who like your starters rolled up, why not try the sausage-egg-and-veggie crepes known as Popiah, sided with a bowl of zesty Sambal Belacan (chili and dried shrimp sauce)? Why yes, they do indeed have the chicken and/or beef skewers called Satay here as well - thanks for asking!

Ready for more? How about Roti Telur - layered flatbread (a bit similar to the Indian bread known as Paratha) stuffed with a fresh egg, then griddled and served with either chicken or lentil curry? Maybe the spicy rice noodle dish Mee Siam, brimming with beansprouts and plump shrimp, is more your speed? But we can&#39;t forget about the seafood soup called Laksa, whose rich coconut broth may inspire you to make sounds as-yet-unheard in everyday parlance. And those are just a few options to consider.

Then, why not cap things off with a selection from their fantastic dessert offerings, all of which are made on the premises? I really, really like Kuih Lapis, with its individually-steamed pale pink and green layers of rice flour and coconut milk. But there are also pineapple tarts, or pandan-leaf-flavored crepes, or even the coconut-dusted rice balls called Onde-Onde, filled with Gula Melaka (dark palm sugar) to appease you.

So let me get this straight... after all that, you still haven&#39;t eaten? Well, I&#39;ll bet I can guess where you&#39;re heading in a moment! And who knows, you may also soon find me there.

Makan? Whoopee!"

We were looking for a quiet place to chat and a quick bite to snack on - both of our needs were met. We had the dumplings and wontons with a sweet chili sauce-both were very tasty and served quickly. I would have liked to explore the menu more but panicked due to our time restriction so went with a go to. Hope to be more adventurous on a future visit. Staff was very nice and accommodating.

We&#39;ve been meaning to check out Makan for years, and we finally got our chance on a warm Friday night. We ate early (6:30) and had the place to ourselves except for a couple of guys who stopped in for a beer. The restaurant is very attractive, immaculate, and smells great. The staff couldn&#39;t be nicer, and the food&#39;s great, although toned down too much for my taste.

The best part of our meal was watching the chef prepare roti, always fun to watch. We ordered several orders of roti canai, roti telur, lamb murtabak, and laksa. This was way too much food for us, considering that my six year old ate maybe 2 bites of food, but we were excited to eat one of our favorite cuisines after a long drought. The roti were perfect, up there with any I&#39;ve eaten anywhere. My only complaint is that the sauces were a 1 on a spicy scale from 1 to 100. I understand that not everyone wants real Malaysian heat, but no one even asked us. At least provide some hot sauces for us to add at the table.

The only disappointment was the laksa, which was completely under seasoned. The tofu was an odd addition too. I&#39;ve never had laksa that didn&#39;t taste of fish, and the fish balls in Makan&#39;s version didn&#39;t provide much flavor. The broth wasn&#39;t salty or flavorful enough, and I wouldn&#39;t order that again, but I will be back. $48 isn&#39;t cheap for Malaysian street food, but we did have enough to bring home."

I am intrigued about other things on the menu. I wish there was a few more veggie options, but they were very accommodating when I asked about omitting the shrimp from the Mee Siam dish.

Food:
*Kaya Toast: tasteless. 

*Roti Prata: not cooked properly, probably because their stove is not hot enough; crispy on the edges, but majority of it was still doughy and raw.

*Mee Siam: this was probably the best dish we&#39;ve tried; flavor was good, overall textures were fine, a bit soupy for me, but overall, not bad.

*Beef Rendang: felt like eating beef stew, missing spices that makes rendang stand out from beef stew, beef cut was right, but not tender enough, nor had the roundup creamy texture... 

*Sambal Kangkung: belacan taste/smell were mild, wish it was bolder; kangkung (ong choy) was overcooked, and it was overly sweet. Same stove issue...

*Ikan Bilis: anchovies were soggy instead of crispy. Sambal was tasty, but again, overly sweet.

Overall, nothing really stands out. Service was nice, but really slow, maybe because they have just opened this restaurant."

I took a friend and her son there, and as I&#39;ve lived in Malaysia and speak the language and am familiar with the food, they asked that I order for them. I ordered 3 entrees and 2 appetizers. The server came back to let me know that they couldn&#39;t leave out the egg and meat in one entree (the Char Kue Teow which is a noodle dish). I explained for the second time that I&#39;m vegetarian and would pay more for them to just use vegetables and leave out the eggs. The owner then raised her voice from across the room and said &#34;We just can&#39;t make the char kue teow that way. It won&#39;t taste the same.&#34; 

So I asked the server (who was standing by our table) if she could just tell her that I didn&#39;t really mind if it didn&#39;t taste right (to the owner) but that I&#39;m vegetarian (3rd explanation) and would just like it with vegetables.&#34; The server walked over to the owner and explained it to her, and the owner once again stands right where she is and explains to me from across the room that she&#39;s unable to cook it that way as it &#34;won&#39;t taste good&#34;!!! What an idiot!! There were 3 other tables that were occupied and everyone was looking at us by that time, and it was a very embarrassing experience. Had we not had an eager child with us, I would have just paid for our drinks and left. Unfortunately, the little guy was fascinated by the names of the food, and had already decided what he wanted for dessert and I wasn&#39;t going to spoil it for him. So I ordered a roti canai which is much cheaper than the char kuey teow and had a very unpleasant meal. 

The food itself was OK, not great but not bad either, however we will not be returning to that place. It&#39;s not the responsibility of the chef or owner of a restaurant to decide if the customer will like something based on what they think it will taste like. It&#39;s just their responsibility to cook what&#39;s ordered. Obviously if I asked for a cupful of chilli paste or 5 tbsp of salt to be added to the meal then they can give me their opinion. But asking them to leave out the meat and eggs shouldn&#39;t be rocket science to follow. Will NEVER be returning there again."

The service was pleasant but a bit slow, which we probably would not have noticed if we hadn&#39;t somewhere to go.  The fixed tasting menu was filling--reasonably priced for the amount of food, and enough for 2 (one big eater, one moderate eater) to share easily, though my spouse did order his own separate roti canai.  A wonderful experience and we will return."

The owner who did most of the cooking was really nice and came out and talked to us a bit.  The food was all good and tasty.  However, the prices were a little steep in my friends opinion.  I know that it&#39;s in a high rent district so I understand, but it seems like a place like this belongs on Havana or Federal where the prices can be a bit lower due to lower lease/rent.  With that said go and give it a try it&#39;s a nice change from most other places in the Pearl St. district area."

I went here on a Wednesday around 7 and it was fairly empty -- my husband and I were the only people in there aside from a couple off in the corner. We started with the Siu Mai - 3 tiny little dumplings.  They were good, but literally just 3 bites total. I guess that&#39;s all you can expect for $3.75 though so not sure what other reviewers are complaining about.

I then ordered the Mee Siam ($10.95) for my entree and did not like it. The menu described the dish as &#34;spicy and tangy stir-fried vermicelli with shrimp, tofu and green onion, topped with shredded omelet, bean sprouts and a wedge of lime for dressing&#34;. There was a very unpleasant order and taste to the dish -- like rotten fish or something equally unpleasant.  I actually love seafood, and fish sauce and all those things alike, but this dish was really not for me.  I did like the thin rice noodles though, but I couldn&#39;t eat much of it due to the unpleasant aroma and whatever the sauce was. I asked for hot sauce and more lime in attempts to doctor the dish up to my liking, but there really wasn&#39;t anything you could do to improve it other than starting from scratch and adding less of whatever that horrible taste was (maybe shrimp paste or something fermented?).

My husband got the Char Kueh Tiao (10.95) which was flat rice noodles stir-fried with soy sauce, a hint of chili, Chinese sausage, shrimp, egg, bean sprouts and chives.  This dish tasted better than mine.  Overall small portions which is fine with me -- I don&#39;t need to leave a restaurant needing to unbutton my pants, so not sure what everyone else was complaining about, but I see no reason to return here.

Oh and they have good tea here, but no alcohol whatsoever."

All great. The popiah was different from those we&#39;ve had in Penang (Malaysia) and Singapore, though those were different from each other as well. Makan&#39;s version came with a terrific dipping sauce. The beef rendang was superb, we don&#39;t agree with a previous reviewer that it was beef stew, missing in the spices that make it rendang. Also, the chicken curry that came with the roti was terrific, though the roti was a little uncooked in the middle, but delicious nonetheless especially when sopping up the curry. The only thing missing was ice cold beer, perhaps a Tiger beer (no alcohol; yes, Malaysia is Muslim but beer is common to find with meals there).

Onefold is home to one of my favorite breakfasts ever, and (lucky me!) just happens to be just a mile or two away from my house. I first tried the Congee porridge last winter while dining in with a friend--it&#39;s been one of those things I wake up craving since then. I now order it and have it delivered when I&#39;m wanting something warm and comforting (which is very often). The savory asian porridge is cooked with your choice of chicken or turkey broth, filled with rich pieces of duck confit, and served with the perfect poached egg, green onions, salted ginger, and chili oil. It&#39;s perfect parts savory and spicy and will leave you full and satisfied for hours. My boyfriend adores the breakfast tacos and the breakfast burrito, but I&#39;m loyal to the Congee porridge every time. 

The interior of Onefold is really gorgeous, with minimal white walls, pretty wood floors, and rad modern light fixtures. Like most places in Uptown, parking can be a little tricky, but it&#39;s honestly not that bad. Just go try the Congee porridge, you can thank me later."

Even better is that this restaurant is a mere 6 minutes from my new job!

My first trip in, I came with my aunt.  She ordered the bacon fried rice with a fresh squeezed OJ and I had a terrible time deciding so I finally left it in the hands of the employee who selected the congee for me.  The OJ was the first to come out to the table and as other people have said, it literally tastes like you are sucking on an orange.  So fresh and delicious, even my aunt who doesn&#39;t get as excited about food as I do, loved it.

The congee I had, although it was my first time eating congee, was perfectly seasoned with the duck and crispy green onions.  I ate the whole bowl and didn&#39;t feel stuffed at all.  I got to try my aunt&#39;s bacon fried rice and it was equally delicious.  I will be making that choice another round.

My second trip in was a Tuesday and after seeing the breakfast tacos on trip #1 it was all I could think about.  I also stumbled on Taco Tuesday so they were $2 per taco.  They were supposed to have pork belly aka bacon but I had almost none in my tacos.  Totally ok because everything else was so tasty.  The green salsa was my favorite and next time I am going to ask for more of that one.  But the tacos were like nothing I&#39;ve ever had before, crispy hash browns, soft eggs and then that gorgeous griddled mozzarella."

From the atmosphere to the menu and the quality - Onefold is perfect. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Onefold is small, with indoor seating for maybe twenty people tops, but if you play your cards right you can secure some floorspace. My party of eight was going to be a challenge from the get go, but we sent three scouts to gradually grab some seats while ordering drinks and we eventually had a quorum. You order at the front at Onefold and take your seat, and the dishes, made fresh right behind the counter, typically come out in maybe fifteen minutes or so. From there the atmosphere is excellent in a very cool part of town. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

More or less everything at Onefold comes to between $10.00 and $12.00, and the portions are absolutely massive across the board. The menu isn&#39;t broad per se, but from the fried rice to the tacos and the burritos, you&#39;ll without question find something to suit your breakfast fancy and likely even your lunch fancy given how many leftovers you&#39;re likely to have. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Everything, and I do mean everything, at Onefold was excellent. The bacon and duck fried rice? Quality that would put any Asian establishment to shame. The breakfast burritos and tacos? Unique, flavorful, and customizeable enough to suit any need. Some necessary shout outs to the pan fried cheese on the breakfast tacos, the crispy hash browns on everything, and the iced masala chai. Wonderful. Dual Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

A great atmosphere and an affordable, well executed menu. Star Granted."

Time was at 09:35hrs.  We went here on a Saturday, January 16th 2016 - which was a WEEKEND and this establishment is indeed jam packed aka packed to the Brim!  Is this a good sign?  I do hope so.  Since we cannot get any seats when we arrived, my friend left her contact number, so the staffs can call when our seats is available.

YES, there is limited patio seats outside when weather permits.  YES this establishment is tiny.  We waited about 15 to 20 minutes or so, when we received the phone call.  Thankfully we managed to find parking spot behind the establishment.

We are seated near the Door aka Entrance which can be COLD to some, since every single minute or so, people come in and out of the door and perhaps due to insulating etc.  YES did I say this establishment is tiny.  YES everyone is packed like &#34;SARDINES&#34;.  YES it is busy ALWAYS!!!

Anyhow, from the limited BREAKFAST Menu, my friend ordered the Breakfast Taco ($10.99) and the Bone Broth while I opt for the Congee ($10.99).  Why I say limited coz a lot of the dishes in Onefold Menu contains BACON OR PORK in which I don&#39;t consume.  Both my friend and I like the Small BONE Broth ($3.99).  It is definitely comforting aka COMFORT FOOD like how we used to have growing up.  This dish definitely get 2 thumps up from us.  I also opt for Small Coffee ($2.49).

We received our Main Entrees at about 10:30hrs ish.

My friend like her order Breakfast order.  Personally it is a 3 stars GENEROUS review.... at best coz the Congee was too salty for my taste bud...  We managed to speak to the lovely staffs if I am NOT mistaken the Owner&#39;s wife and tell her about our concerns.  Maybe when I received my order of Congee it was the final batch before they start a new one etc and hence the Congee gets too salty.

In terms of the menu, they have potential to grow in my books.  Maybe next time, if I return, I would try other dishes and ask if I can omit those items that I don&#39;t eat etc.

It is at the top of my list of very favorite places in Denver. Yes, I have an actual list. I know, I&#39;m a nerd. Shut up.

The bright little space is postcard gorgeous. The coffee is amazing. The staff is great. Most importantly, the food is perfect. PERFECT-UH. Seriously. Try to find a bad item on the menu, I fucking dare you. You can&#39;t, can you? That&#39;s what I thought. Sorry for cursing. I get excited about onefold. Taco Tuesday will get you $2 breakfast tacos, the best anywhere in my opinion. They contain crazy crispy cheesey tasties which are certainly the result of some devilish pact made by the chef. Any other day, bacon fried rice or the breakfast burrito, which is my favorite in the city, and duck congee in the wintertime is essential. What&#39;s that? You don&#39;t want breakfast because you&#39;re stupid? No problem, idiot. Enchiladas. Adobo. Oxtail fried rice. Am I going to fast? Are you afraid? KEEP UP, GRASSHOPPER. 

Let me deal with some of your concerns. It&#39;s small, you say. Yeah. Don&#39;t come on a sunday. Come another time. Make time for onefold. Make time for joy in your life. You&#39;re always working. 
It&#39;s expensive, you say. No it isn&#39;t. Pay an extra dollar a plate to know that whoever made it cares about your food, and used decent ingredients. 
There&#39;s no table service, you say. I know. Why do you care? It&#39;s brilliant. It&#39;s makes things move faster. 

If any of these things seriously upset you, go eat dunkin donuts in your car with the knowledge that you do not deserve onefold. We&#39;re better off without you. I&#39;m moving on. I feel better already."

To start, I love the menu. For breakfast and lunch, there are no more than 7 options but each one sounds so darn good. The place itself is also on the small side. We walked in and had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated (which ended up being at the bar), but were able to get some beverages to sip on while hanging. We also watched plate after plate go by - bacon fried rice, congee, breakfast burritos... Everything looked AMAZING.

I never had Vietnamese coffee so went with that since they didn&#39;t have espresso - cold brew with some sweet condensed milk. It was very indulgent and carried me over to our main meal. My dad and I decided to split the breakfast tacos since portions are huge. They came with  tender belly bacon, scrambled eggs, crispy hashbrowns, and the kicker - GRILLED MOZZARELLA CHEESE. Paired with a fruit cup, one taco was just enough but boy, I would&#39;ve happily attempted to eat that entire plate myself. These were so good. 

On the way out, we grabbed a pistachio macaron which was perfect. The carrot cake also looked wonderful.

Per my fellow Yelpers, the Vietnamese iced coffee was by far the most highly recommended beverage here. I was very curious and gave it a try! It was definitely not the typical cà phê süa dá that you get at, for example, pho places. This one had no bitterness to it at all. Even my non-coffee drinker friend enjoyed it! It went down very smoothly and was pleasantly sweet.

I also devoured a bacon fried rice. I know... Why in the world would I order fried rice and not something more special?? It was unexpected that it tasted nothing like Asian fried rice. The two sunny-side ups sat nicely on top of the rice. The rice was pretty spicy, but it was very enjoyable nonetheless. I was only able to finish half of it; very generous portion sizes. My only complaint was the number of flies that flew around. Onefold had two big windows open for fresh air, which I completely love. I just wish that I could&#39;ve enjoyed my meal without having to swat flies."

It is not a full service place technically more like casual dining. The outside seating area has a few tables. We were there on Sat and it was pretty busy.

Food - I loved the duck congee. It has such a perfect combination of everything. The breakfast sandwich was also good but no any greens on it though. Would be nice if I can have some options of lettuce/tomatoes/etc.

Parking was surprisingly easy. The restaurant itself is really pretty with a great patio that would have been even nicer if the construction across the street turned the volume down a bit. Geez guys, do you have to bulldoze so loud?

They did the right thing and offered me my money back for the meal, so no complaints there.

We came in on a Monday at a time in which it wasn&#39;t so busy and thank goodness for that because the place is quite small.  It was our first time in so we were quite clueless that one had to order at the front and self-seat oneself.  

We ended up ordering the bacon fried rice, enchilada de mole, Vietnamese iced coffee, and iced masala chai.  The Vietnamese iced coffee was rather sweet for our taste; we are used to it being more robust.  And the iced masala chai was nothing too out of the ordinary.  However, the bacon fried rice is a staple for the place!!  I honestly step foot in this place due to the countless of pictures I saw of it on social media.  Yes, it is as good as it looks.  My boyfriend and I were really surprised by how good fried rice could taste.  We are Asian and we have had our fair share of fried rice and this was pretty darn delicious.  Also, the enchilada was one of the best I have had.  

However, I am a little confused by the menu:  there&#39;s a little Asian, Mexican, All-American.  I guess that&#39;s okay because food is really great here.  It is made with all local and organic ingredients so prices can be a little high, but I don&#39;t mind paying extra for high quality food.  Also, the servers were super friendly and the place is so cute and homey.  Every table is adorned with a cute fresh flower arrangements and the bar seatings have little hooks for you to hang your bag or jacket.  I can definitely tell the owner of this place has an eye for minor details which I like."

I left your restaurant still salivating over the best smothered breakfast burrito I&#39;ve ever ate.

I breathed slowly and day dreamed about your melted asadero cheese slowly oozing down covering everything in its goodness.  

I thought back to the simpler times when food was just food.  When a fine brunch was made by ingredients my simple brain could pronounce with just a couple syllables and handmade the morning it would be devoured by my hungry lips.  

I praise your food for being what they are and letting the star of the dish shine as it should.  If I could be Scrooge McDuck and dive in your goodness every morning I would pay to do so and swim in all its goodness."

Being a newbie to the city, I didn&#39;t know one place from the next, so I&#39;m glad she just took charge and chose a spot that was not only aesthetically amazing, but delicious at the same time.

For eats, my eyes were automatically drawn to the bacon fried rice and my mind was already made up. The rest of the menu was a blur and I could care less about anything else. This dish came loaded with crispy rice, two duckfat fried eggs, pork belly bacon, garlic, green onions, soy sauce, and chili oil. Not only was it a heaping serving, it had a nice little kick to every bite with the incorporation oil. I ate what I could and wished I had boxed up the rest to consume on the plane.

In the coffee department, you have your option of drips, pour overs or iced beverages. Since it was semi-chilly outside, I went with the pour over and it did not disappoint. The spot doesn&#39;t have an espresso bar, but their brews will definitely hold over the most fickle of coffee connoisseurs - I was happy.

Service was not only friendly but quick to bring us our orders. We sat at the counter, so it was pretty cool to watch all of the delicious food being prepped before heading out to their hungry tables.

I wish this spot was closer to me as I&#39;d be a loyal patron, but until then - it will just have to be on my must-stops the next time I&#39;m in Denver!"

I had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast here on a snowy Saturday morning.  The interior is a lot smaller than I thought with only four or five tables and a small bar area overlooking the kitchen.  In the warmer months they do have several tables on an outdoor patio.  If you come later than 9am I would expect to wait a little while.  

We sampled a warmed Almond Croissant, Bacon Fried Rice with two sunny side up eggs and the Breakfast Burrito with sausage smothered in green chili.  The Almond Croissant which we received warmed was a very nice version; buttery, flakey and had a nice amount of almond mixture in the middle.  

I really enjoyed the Bacon Fried Rice, the bacon flavor was prominent and the sprinkle of green onions and soy sauce was a nice addition.  Next time I will definitely ask for some Sriracha to add a little heat.  The portion was more than enough for breakfast; I took half of it home and had it for lunch the next day (yum).  

I had a few bites of the monstrous smothered Burrito and it was fabulous.  The green chili had a nice warming heat and the sausage was mixed throughout was very flavorful.  I would gladly return to order this myself.  

Throughout our entire meal our server was friendly and answered all of our questions.  The menu may be small; however the dishes they offer are delicious.  I would love to see Onefold change up their menu from time to time with some new offerings to keep things fresh."

2. From the Congee to the Burrito, to the Mole Enchiladas, everything you eat at Onefold will be delicious. Just work your way down the menu.

3. Best Vietnamese coffee in the downtown area.

4. The tables and restaurant are small. It&#39;s only good for small intimate groups.

5. At one point they were open for dinner. I don&#39;t know what happened, but dinner is no more. I want to try Onefold dinner. *sad face*

The breakfast burrito was very well done, with our famous Colorado green chili inside. The congee had just the right amount of white pepper, allowing the flavors of the egg, bacon, and green onions to really come out. Finally, the duck-fat egg bacon fried rice had just the right amount of oil and the right amount of chili oil. Truly, every dish was tasty, memorable, and full of flavor.

The congee is also pretty damn delicious. It had that perfect congee consistency: not too thick and mushy but also not watery. The goldilocks of congee. The fixins were on point as well; I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had duck confit in my congee before Onefold.

One of Denver&#39;s hottest restaurants of 2015, the breakfast and lunch-only space serving a small but interesting menu in the shadow of a sizable local healthcare center, Onefold seemed like a pleasant spot for breakfast on Monday but between the subpar food and subsequent vitriol from the owner it would be hard to fathom a worse overall experience than the one that was offered.

Entering the narrow space early, only one two-top accounted for with another duo to follow, it was exclusively with congee in mind that the counter was approached but catching my eye with an almond croissant it was on the recommendation of pleasant server that the item was warmed to order, the $18 bill paid and a seat obtained as I sat and waited while reviewing E-mail on my computer.

Sparsely decorated and mostly white, flowers adding splashes of color to each table, it was after perhaps five minutes that the laminated pastry was brought forth and with photos taken the initial impression was a favorable one, the top nicely laminated with a good crunch while subsequent bites proved quite the opposite as the bottom was literally plastered with sticky-sweet Frangipane.  

Picking slowly at the good bits while one of two cooks ladled rice and accoutrements into a bowl, it was almost immediately on presentation that something seemed awry, the oily orange halo emitting an aroma that itself singed nostrils with the first bite confirming suspicions of overwhelming heat while a second proved more than enough, the bowl and a plate carried to the front with laptop, bag, cup and croissant left behind - the young ladies actually thanking me while explaining I need not bus the table before realizing the large vessel was still full.

Neither requesting nor expecting a refund, the croissant admittedly a disaster while the porridge was arguably a matter of taste, it was at the behest of the cashier that a replacement plate was offered and although several dining plans followed I accepted the generosity, two out of a trio of tacos texturally compelling enough to be enjoyed despite their mild flavor while the other was left behind along with the croissant&#39;s sopping-wet layer.

*****Posting photos and a brief summary later via Facebook, something those who know me will realize is common for all my meals out, it was much to the surprise of myself and several others when the Onefold account opted to blow up and tell lies of &#34;throwing&#34; food and &#34;making a scene&#34; publicly, the restaurant&#39;s supposed owner going so far as to call me creepy while spewing expletives, eventually posting security camera footage claiming evidence of me eating the whole croissant based on one of two small plates being empty.

Unfathomably unprofessional, poking fun at my writing as well as my true profession in a very public way before backtracking and saying I never actually &#34;threw&#34; food or made a scene - the whole conversation preserved on my wall with parts via PM - it would be an understatement to restate the initial opinion that Onefold is thus far my worst meal of this year, the fallout actually making it far more memorable and perhaps my most hilariously bad dining experience of all time.*****"

From our experience to putting our name down to paying the bill, brunch here was FLAWLESS. Beyoncé would be proud.

We were told there would be a 30 minute wait. If you&#39;re a weekend bruncher, you&#39;ll know the hectic experience of sitting outside a restaurant waiting for a host/hostess to holler your name and number in your party. God forbid you&#39;re scrolling distractedly through your Instagram feed and miss your chance at mimosas. This anxiety is too much for a millennial to bear.

Well, not here. They have a program where you are able to put your name down on an app and track on your phone how long you&#39;ve been waiting and how many parties are ahead of you. No lie. 

There&#39;s a Starbucks nearby where we waited our turn and they sent us a text informing us the table was ready. They didnt even bat an eye when we walked in with Starbucks drinks. High tech waiting app with no side of snobbery - I like this menu already.

Onefold is charming with restored wood tables and mini floral center pieces on each table. They even have cute white high chairs for babies/toddlers. The huge window that faces the street provides great natural lighting. 

Now the food. My friends and I got the Bacon Fried Rice, the breakfast tacos and the burrito with carne asada. Everything was delicious and well executed, fresh and vibrant. The portions were also very generous. We washed down our food with Vietnamese iced coffees which were sweet and strong.

That 4.95 cup of orange juice was damn expensive...but hot damn was it delicious! Smooth, velvety, sweet, something about it tasted different and wonderful! I never thought I could love orange juice so much. With every sip I felt all giddy inside...wishing I had a chocolate cake to pair it with :) 

It&#39;s apparent we ordered the orange juice. We also ordered the bone broth, the breakfast tacos with corn tortillas, and the simple breakfast. 

The bone broth was great and very filling. They even sell it in large quantities to take home. 

Breakfast tacos were delicious...the corn tortilla tasted like it was handmade right there in the restaurant. The hash browns were so crispy and delicious.I would recommend the tacos, but the salsa was a bit spicy and not super flavorful for me. Aside from the salsa, I would recommend this dish.

The simple breakfast was...a little too simple. It needed a sauce or something to spice it up a bit. The maple sausage was very tasty though!

Everything on the menu is listed as organic and tasted high quality. Everything is made with duck fat including the potatoes, hash browns, eggs, and more!

As for the service....it was not good. We were seated at the bar and experienced very inattentive staff. We (and everyone else sitting around us) had to walk up to the front counter to ask for more water, drinks, and anything else we needed. We also had to wait over a half hour for our food.

Over priced for average food. We tell the girl were both vegetarians. I got the burrito and she got the omelet that&#39;s suppose to be vegetarian. Big chunks of bacon. We just pick them out and move on.

Congee: Very good first few bites, but after some time it became super salty! 4.1/5 
Tacos: Not your regular taco! Had pork belly and crispies in it! 3.8/5 
Fresh Coconut: Very refreshing and sure did seem fresh! 5/5 
Vietnamese Iced Coffee: Would suggest going down to federal for the real stuff. Way to sweet here, tastes more like an iced latte. 1/5

The Congee: savory rice porridge cooked in chicken/turkey stock, tender belly smoked ham, poached egg, green onions, soy sauce, salted ginger and chili oil - is really as good as you&#39;d imagine. Every ingredient is strongly and deliciously pronounced in this perfectly simple dish. The Tender Belly smoked ham portions are generous and that salted ginger and chili oil really completes the dish.

Speaking of simple yet perfect, the restaurant itself is the embodiment of &#39;less is more&#39;: clean, white surfaces with pops of color found in the fresh cut flowers adorning the counter tops in the small space. There&#39;s two-top tables and counter seating that allows for a more bistro feel. You order at the counter and await your delectable meal as they cook it made to order right there in front of you. They even serve pour over coffee. All in all, the Asian and classic breakfast makes for an unlikely brilliant collaboration."

It&#39;s in a really unassuming spot, so much so that the last person I took there asked me how I found it. (On Yelp, obiv.) The menu is small, but the food is so fantastic. My favorite breakfast dish is the bacon fried rice made with twi duckfat fried eggs, tender belly bacon, garlic, green onions, soy sauce, and chili oil. It&#39;s got a little spice to it, but nothing outrageous and the portion size is pretty dang big. I&#39;ve yet to finish my whole serving in one go, but I&#39;ve got goals to get there.

The coffee menu is also fairly small - they do drip coffees and pour-overs, but they don&#39;t have an espresso machine so you can&#39;t get any other kind of coffee drink. They also offer tea, OJ, beer, and wine to drink. Hello, mimosas.

  Reading about Onefold, we found that they make, and I&#39;m quoting from their website here, 
      &#34;homestyle foods that are organic, local and animal fat friendly. Most of our            
      ingredients are organic and locally sourced. We make almost everything in   
      house from our tortillas that are pressed fresh to order to our bone broths that 
      simmer all night long.&#34;  
   This caught our attention right away, as we wanted to try it.

Walking to the restaurant on a Saturday morning, we found the restaurant quite easily It was nondescript on the outside, but what was on the inside was not even close to nondescript. It was: extraordinary, uncommon, distinguished, remarkable, and more. I hope you get the picture.

The interior was clean, with nice lines and curves, browns, whites, tans, and steel. There isn&#39;t lots of room for lots of patrons, which I think they will have, as soon as word spreads, and it will spread! There is an outside patio area, but in November, it was a bit too cold to sit outside.

We explained to the waitress this was our first time there, so she explained the menu to us. We ordered the house coffee, which was very good, and left me wanting more, which of course, I did! 

For breakfast we ordered the &#34;Simple Breakfast,&#34; which came with 2 slices of tender belly bacon (I ordered the maple), duckfat fried potatoes, and 2 duckfat fried eggs. I&#39;ve never had duckfat, but I did know that duckfat is 100% pure duckfat, no additives or preservatives. It also gives the food that is cooked in it, &#34;added depth.&#34; I know some restaurants, some chefs, like cooking with duckfat. I was willing to give it a try. I was so glad that I did!

My first bite of my breakfast was unforgettable! I said, &#34;Oh My Gosh!&#34; to my husband, as the various depths of flavors played on my tongue and with my tastebuds! I was in food heaven! I didn&#39;t know that food could taste that good! I wanted it to last for hours and hours. I took my time, and savored each decadent bite. WOW! Each and every bite was as good as, if not better, than the first bite. 

I looked at the menu again, trying to decide what I would have for my next breakfast there? Would it be, the Crepes? the Congee? No, it would be the Bacon Fried Rice! Wait! I could have it all, but maybe not in one sitting! It will take several visits, which I&#39;m game for! 

The service, price, atmosphere, all of it, was Decadent! Unforgettable! I&#39;ll see you there!
Pst! Don&#39;t tell anyone, but I&#39;m afraid the word is already out!"

The burritos are still amazing but service sucked! After our first amazing experience, we were super stoked to bring our friends visiting from out of town to Onefold.  We&#39;ve seriously been talking about the burritos for a week.  

So we show up, all pumped.  There were empty tables all over... only 4 tables had people seated but there were people standing outside and a huge line.  The hostess seemed frazzled and doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s doing.  Plus she had an attitude.  We can hear her complaining to her friends outside.  We were so confused on their seating system.  The owner seemed super friendly but our waitress was only so-so.  Sad... it seemed like since our last visit, this place got really popular (which we are happy for them but they need to hire better wait staff)

I worked at a hostess and waitress throughout college so I don&#39;t lightly give bad reviews on service since I know it can be a tough job...but service was simply not good here.  If you are going to work in food services, you need to at least be nice to people while you are at work and learn to deal with the stress that comes with the busy rush.  Reading some of the recent reviews, I agree with some of the posts: the wait staff act like they are too cool for school.  Not the way to go in a service industry.  Plus I ordered the tacos and it wasn&#39;t as good as the burrito.  I just eyed my husband&#39;s food the whole time...  The tacos had too much crunchy potatoes in it and not enough eggs and protein.  It felt like I was eating a taco wrapped around chips with a piece of fried cheese on top.  Definitely going back to the burrito next time... after enough time has passed for us to get over the bad service and start craving that tasty tasty burrito again.

But seriously... the burritos are epic."

I will say that the potatoes were very good; cooked well seasoned nicely.

You walk in and pay at the register before you get your food and they use an iPad Square payment system with an awkward option to tip 15,20 25% before you receive your food or have any service. This seems weird to me, there really is not a server so it&#39;s kind of like tipping the cashier at a McDonald&#39;s or Wendy&#39;s.

We both had the breakfast burrito and was very interested in potatoes cooked in duckfat, but what we found was a blah tasting burrito, there was no taste to it at all.

Our waitstaff never came by to check on how things were or if I needed a refill on my water or even ask if I would be interested in some coffee...I needed something with some flavor!!!!!!

We&#39;ve tried: Bloody Marys, congee, tacos, and breakfast burritos.

The Bloody Marys we had during our first visit had been the best we&#39;d had in Denver.  This time, however, we learned they had changed the recipe. Our drinks were bland, had no kick, and tasted slightly fishy. Bring back the spicy, Tabasco-y bloody!

We had the breakfast burrito with both meals, the first time was spectacular, the second was well less than that. We found the green chile to be tasteless and overly thickened with corn starch . The bacon, potatoes, and eggs were very good still, but the green chile pretty much ruined it.

I had the congee previously which was good, but one note. It needed more toppings and seasoning to balance it.

This time I tried the breakfast tacos. They were very good, the only fault was that one of the accompanying sauces was very bland. The other (jalapeño?) sauce was excellent.

I guess it really depends on who&#39;s cooking. I absolutely fell in love with this place the first time we came here, this time was disappointing. I might give them another shot and hope that next time we get a better meal."

Even the orange juice is exceptional when compared to fresh squeezed at other places.

Even though it was $4.95, it was so good that I had to order a second! Since I was visiting Denver only for a couple of days, who knew when I would be back so I had to get in another glass! LOL

So we ordered the congee, bacon fried rice and tacos.

My mom makes the best homemade congee but the rice porridge at Onefold was just as good as my mom except it had a little twist to it! There was an egg in addition to it being cooked in chili oil... Which I think gave the congee a nice little kick to the dish! Definitely a must try at Onefold!

Next up, the bacon fried rice with duck fried eggs. Ok, I&#39;m Asian and I loooooooovvvvvveeeeeee fried rice! This fried rice is probably one of the best I had in a long time! If eating carbs wasn&#39;t an issue, I would have order a large, giant bucket of Onefold&#39;s fried rice and just eat it non-stop until my belly exploded and I would die! Haha I&#39;m serious, it was that good! Again, cooking it in chili oil gave the fried rice a spicy kick, the crispy bacon bits gave every bite an unexpected crunch and flavor and the duck fried eggs were cooked to perfection! Loved that the edges on the eggs were perfectly crispy. 

Lastly, the tacos. Okay, so the reason why I&#39;m giving Onefold at 4-star and not a 5-star is because of the tacos. The tacos were supposed to have some pork belly in them and there were none :(

There were a lot going on with the tacos, layers of cheese, crispy hash browns, eggs, etc.... So when it first arrived at our table, we each had a couple of bites into our taco and our reaction was &#34;Wow! This is a pretty damn good taco! However, something is missing!&#34; That&#39;s when we realized that we didn&#39;t taste any pork belly that was supposed to be in the tacos. We didn&#39;t want to say anything to our waitress so we just continue to eat them as is and it was still pretty good... I&#39;m sure it would have been AMAZING with the pork belly though! I can only imagine! LOL

Anyhoo, this just means I&#39;ll have to make my way back to Denver and try the tacos again with the pork belly!

So tacos, fresh, squeezed OJ, congee and fried rice are all a must at Onefold!"

The menu and food of Onefold has a pan-asian, global tilt with duck confit congee, fried rice, and breakfast tacos/burritos providing an introduction to their take on brunch.  But it&#39;s served in a white napkin, hip, continentally-designed space, sort of like a modern french cafe.  It&#39;s the perfect place for a homey but fancy brunch in the city.  I had the congee, which was great on a cold winter morning.  The congee itself, which is usually bland rice gruel, was very savory, having been made with a tasty chicken-turkey broth.  With all the ingredients--confit, pickled ginger, soy, etc.--, it came out a little bit salty. Because it was late in the day, the congee might have cooked down to a saltier state than usual, but it might be something for them to watch out for.  My brunch companions also found some problems with saltiness of the chicken adobo and the chicken wings. Overall, everyone was very happy with their breakfast selections.   The bottomless cups of coffee were also nicely brewed, but you pay for the right to a refill.

One note, the space is very small, so expect a long wait on weekends.  And I wish they would do something about the cold wind that blows in every time the door opens.  (They might want to do what other small foyer-less restaurants do and hang a curtain at the front entrance.)  For the tables at the front, the biting wind can be cruel reminder of the world outside of the warm embrace of Onefold."

No complaints, though, because there are never long waits and the prices are way low for the quality. 

Plus, the staff is super nice and willing to help you with the (admittedly difficult) decision making process. Difficult because, you know, everything is outstanding.

For wheelchair users: Zero barrier to entry. Seating is pretty straightforward, but you&#39;ll want to sit toward the front or on the patio if you want to be comfortable and not feel like your chair is obstructing the walkway. The place is small but the staff has always been extremely accommodating! I haven&#39;t ever tried to go to the restroom, so I can&#39;t comment on that aspect. I&#39;ll check next time, though."

The drip coffee is good but definitely go for the pour over if they haven&#39;t run out. The chai is great; not too sweet or gingery. 

I love the Asian flavors in the menu items. The chicken adobo is really great but to make it even better ask for a side of fish sauce. 

The breakfast tacos are different and light. I loved the fried mozzarella on them and my wife thought the super light and crispy fried potatoes were the best part. 

What keeps me from handing out five stars is the green chile on the breakfast burrito which was pretty blah but still an overall really good dish and the the fact that they ran out of pour over coffee. With such a small selection of beverages some serious attention should be paid to inventory."

Well in this case we left my car the night prior because I got a bit tipsy the night before so I went to get my car and then a 2go order from here.  After reading several reviews I decided to try everything unique on the menu.  I got 4 dishes, would&#39;ve been 5, but when I called to put my order, they said they no longer had the Duck Hash. :( I loved how simple their bags with their name printed on it and cups. I actually drove right by it because I saw a thai place that stood out more. &#34;Onefold&#34; is right next to it.  It is a very cute and quaint place seating on the outside and one long table towards that back and then their was a table right inside across from the register..  There are cute bar stools where you can sit and watch them cook. the place is very clean and has somewhat of a chicness to it. It&#39;s really inviting and the girls who worked the front counter were very friendly.  As I waited for my food I decided to get 2 pastries and a Hot Chai Latte.  As soon as I got into the car I wanted to try a little of each entree to taste it fresh and Hot. Here&#39;s the low down:

 Congee - A+ This was Super good!  Almost as good as my grandmothers, we call it &#34;Jook&#34; in Hawaii. I love the bacon and their touch of putting an egg in it. It&#39;s hearty, somewhat porridge creamy and just darn good!

Tacos - A++  Now this was My FAVORITE!!  Wholly Schmolly the reviews I read on this was spot on!  I love how the hash browns were nice and crunch, no burnt, but Just PERFECT! I love the how it was topped with the egg. This was Absolutely Unbelievably Delicious!!!  

Burritos - B+  this was pretty good, it was nice and hearty, but my taste buds like more seasonings, though it&#39;s perfect for hubby buds.  i liked it with taco salsa&#39;s I used.  I actually would love it with the taco hash browns in the burrito as an option, but it was good. 

Fried Rice - C  this is what I actually was looking forward to, but the least favorite and I was not impressed. It was bland. I put my own shoyu and oyster sauce in it and it enhanced the bacon and flavors they used and was off the hook good. It&#39;s a preference thing, but my Fried rice didn&#39;t really have seasoning in it and the bacon wasn&#39;t salty enough to give it seasoning. 

Croissant Almond - B this was flaky and hearty size and there was a good amount of almond filling in the middle, unlike other bakeries that skimp on the fillings.

Scone? A+  My receipt and the girl ringing it up said it was a scone, but I swear it was like muffin monkey bread you pull apart. This was sooo Good! It wasn&#39;t too sweet, but just perfect!  I wish I got more, but next time I&#39;ll get at least 3-6, just to take home.  

Hot Chai Latte - This was a nice drink and not too sweet. I like how it wasn&#39;t overly strong and a nice milky creamness to it.

All in all I really do like this place a lot and will be back often since it&#39;s only 5minutes from my hubby&#39;s office.  I like how their menu is simple, no fuss and not overwhelmed with a ton options. They keep it simple and yet still delicious over all and do a good job in customer friendly service.  I went in at 935am and it was not crowded at all, open tables outside and the whole bar stool area open. It&#39;s a small place, so not sure if we&#39;ll dine in one day or just do take out again. Worth a try for sure!"

Any tacos. And it seems like a weird combo: eggs, fried mozzarella, housemade tomatillo. I don&#39;t normally think of mozzarella with salsa. Don&#39;t be fooled. Best taco ever. 

FRIED RICE: Also, I&#39;m pretty picky about fried rice being from Hawaii and they did it beautifully. Perfect amount of spice. I asked about the hot sauce they used in it and it&#39;s homemade. Darn it! I can&#39;t buy any then? 

And I&#39;ve never had a Vietnamese iced coffee I didn&#39;t like but this place didn&#39;t let me down either. I got a second one- I am not gonna sleep for 2 days. #Wired

We stood near the door waiting patiently to be greeted. We were not. It seemed every employee was avoiding eye contact at all costs. One person in our group sat at the counter hoping for a cup of coffee while we waited for a table, where he was not acknowledged at all--he waited for more than 5 minutes. We asked someone near the register if we needed to get on a list or if we just wait until a table is available to snag. They said there is no list, when a table opens up we should take it. Shortly thereafter a table opened up. The three of us (still with no coffee, menus, service, etc) sat down at the table when an employee came over and grunted, &#34;Did you order yet?! You can NOT sit down here unless you have ordered!&#34; We said we had not ordered, but we were told to wait for a table. He was very perturbed with us. We left. This is unacceptable to me. 

Someone should have greeted us. Period. There was no, &#34;Welcome to Onefold, here&#39;s how we do things!&#34; I understand a busy time of day, but that should be expected and planned for. The employees all seemed flustered and uncertain. Where is the management?! 

Major disappointment!"

It&#39;s got an intimate tin can kind of feel.... As many of you know, I&#39;m claustrophobic, so tight tiny establishments make it hard for me to feel relaxed and comfortable but regardless, I still enjoyed my time here. I ordered the requisite bacon fried rice, because it&#39;s literally on every review... so I ordered that, and my friend ordered the same with the breakfast tacos. I also had the Vietnamese French drip coffee. I wanted to get the congee but it was already 90 degrees at 11am and I didn&#39;t feel like sweating through a piping bowl of that. I will  be back in the fall/winter for a bowl, since there are excellent reviews on that option. I love breakfast/lunch food and this place has a comforting mix of bacon infused Asian/Mexican inspired foods that I know and love. While I enjoyed my bacon fried rice, I found it a touch soggy... and that could have been because of a number of factors... but it still was delicious, I&#39;m down for coming back to this cute place and I&#39;m hoping to try a bunch of their other brunchy offerings.

The Pizza is slightly better than frozen from the grocery store. And I am guessing that they are frozen (as opposed to being made on location). The quality is not great. But if you&#39;re in a hurry you might not care, and kids will probably not know the difference.

I have never eaten here, nor will I ever after the crazy employee I had the pleasure of sharing the road with decided it was okay to put my family&#39;s life in danger. My kids and I picked up WingStop in the same parking lot and was almost side swiped while still in the lot by a Big Daddy&#39;s delivery driver. After some revving of his engine and getting on our tail while waiting to turn right onto Havana, I was able to turn and the driver was right there with me. No stopping or hesitation to avoid the cars driving around him. He proceeded to speed past me and flip me off then took it upon himself to be a real winner and cut us off. I had to slam on my brakes in order for us to not hit him. 

When I got home, my husband called the location and asked to speak to a manager. A girl stated there wasn&#39;t one on duty but she was an assistant. My husband explained what happened and she said there was nothing she could do about it. We got the employee&#39;s name and the GM number. Tried to call the GM with no answer.

We did chorizo muscles, mushroom pot pie, gnocchi mac and cheese, and squash soup.  The favorite was definitely the pot pie.  Service was impeccable and the interior is very cute and cozy.  I also loved the folk music being piped in, it was very relaxing and fitting.  The food was actually a little too rich for me, but overall we really enjoyed our experience."

My favorites are Bruce&#39;s Biscuits, Gnocchi Mac &amp; Cheese, Artichoke Fritters, and the Caprese thing.

But, actually, everything here is really tasty. You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.

They only utilize the freshest ingredients from local farms, and once they&#39;re out of an ingredient, they take that item off of the menu for the rest of the day.

The last time I came here, I had rotisserie chicken and it was seriously the most tender chicken I had ever had. They were apparently blessed by the guy who raised them. The potatoes it came with was crispy and delicious.

The service here is always excellent -- the servers are friendly and helpful.

Stop by. Tonight."

Sometimes I just want to drive south, away from downtown, and this is how we found Acres- Yelping while driving south on south Broadway into Englewood.  We made a quick call, and instantly had a reservation.

When we arrived, we had a warm welcome and our name was written on the chalk board- very cool!  We had a nice table by the window, though it might have been fun to sit on the patio too.

We started with a cocktail and had the blueberry pomegranate sangria- this is not on the menu, but delicious and refreshing and you should have one!

Moving on, we opted food wise for small plates and chose the mussels, the artichoke hearts, the mushrooms, and ended with the southwest salad.

Th artichokes in particular were amazing- lemony, crisp, flavorful with a yummy herb dipping sauce.  We loved this tapa!  The mussels were also excellent and we found them tender with tons of great broth and crostini for dipping.  Yum!  The mushrooms had been braised in wine and were wonderful (they would have been great on a steak!)......Finally I finished up with the southwest salad- wonderful flavors, with nice cool  crunchy lettuce, tomatoes, black beans.  The dressing was to die for.

Really wonderful place that you would expect in the highlands and we had a wonderful time and will be back.  

My only small irk was that the sound level was very loud, and it was difficult for the two of us to hear each other over the din.  I looked up and they have a very cool treatment covering old acoustic tiles, but this I think just amplifies the sound."

The menu is small and composed of mainly small plates with 4 entrees or so. There are a handful of specials. This is not the place to visit if you have food allergies. They&#39;re pretty fond of all forms of dairy and frying things. However, the entrees appear to be a bit healthier. Of course Hubs and I just wanted to try several different things so we stuck with the small plates.
We had the spicy mussels, gnocchi mac &amp; cheese, shrimp and grits, and then had the tater tots for dessert. Yeah, I know. 
I loved the broth on the mussels, but the mussels themselves were a bit chewy. The gnocchi mac and cheese was decadent and I was happy that Hubs could eat most of it. It needed hot sauce but it was good to try. The shrimp and grits was a pretty small portion and the description on the menu (Seared shrimp, creamy grits, andouille, jalapeño, cheddar, chives) is a bit misleading as the andouille and jalapeno are barely detectable. I think there was one slice of andouille cut up into 8 tiny little squares. The creamy grits were incredibly delicious. The tater tots were clearly homemade and good, but they did not bowl me over. At this point I think I was just done with all the heaviness of each dish. I needed a vegetable! I&#39;d like to see a few more vegetable options on the menu, actually. 
The happy hour is good with $4 glasses of wine and $2 off all small plates but it only runs 4-6 on Tues, Wed, Thurs, and Sunday.
Very friendly neighborhood place and I definitely recommend stopping in and giving it a chance!"

The Tots and the Gnocci and cheese are to die for!  Next time I MUST try the chocolate mousse as it looked divine as it passed by.  This place has great items on the menu for sharing (a whole page on the menu dedicated to it). Forget your diet in this place, they have fabulous comfort food so bring friends to share the dishes for sure!

Kind of a smaller restaurant designed like an old western/farm theme (think tin roof).  Not sure if they take reservations, but try to make one. They do have a parking lot and if it is full you can find on street parking. Staff was very friendly and attentive.  

Main course did take a long time to get to the table.  I ordered the calamari cesar salad which was good, but I think that was the hold up since they brought our main dishes with another tables that ordered the same item.

Started out the meal with house-made bacon/cheddar tater tots, then moved onto seared scallops with smoked corn before finishing with an amazing chocolate croissant bread pudding.

Tots were crispy and delicious, and the scallops were cooked nicely although a bit smaller than I was hoping they&#39;d be. The bread pudding was fantastic - one of the best renditions of the dish I&#39;ve had due to the extremely rich and crispy texture the croissant base gave them.

This is between a 4 and a 5 star place based on the food, but it got rounded down for having several menu snafus. My guest and I got menus with different items on them, and I had a sheet with a great sounding prix fixe course that I ordered, only to be told it was actually from prior weeks and no longer available. Even after replanning our orders, several of the a la carte items we ordered wound up not actually being available either. Look, I absolutely get that restaurants can run out of popular items - but as a tip your customers will appreciate being notified in advance of what&#39;s been 86&#39;d, not after they&#39;ve already reviewed the menu for five minutes and are ordering.

I had the Idaho Trout which was a bit dry and didn&#39;t have much flavor unfortunately (and is the reason I just rated as ok, considering the price).

Tacos, 0 stars - Had to dig to find any fish in there, and it was topped with dry &#34;slaw&#34; with a couple different salsas on the side. It was so flavorless and uninspired and bleh. Wanted to send it back but we were starving. 

Sliders, 1 star - I love meatloaf. I love sliders. This dish was a complete letdown. I think the menu said brioche buns, but we got store bought, stale sesame seed buns. Loaf had potential, but tasted like they took it out of the warmer and slapped it on bread. Needed a good crisping on the flat top, perhaps with some cheese, a nice smoky Gouda. Should&#39;ve at least come out hot, not room temp. 

Artichoke, 4 stars - Called fritters on the menu but they&#39;re just battered and fried hearts. These were actually hot and pretty tasty with the lemon aioli and you get a good portion. Probably why I gave a 2 rather than 1 star rating. 

This place wants to be cool and hip like downtown restaurants, but doesn&#39;t pull it off in the decor or food. Patio is bare, inside feels dingy and cheap. We paid $50 for our meal (no drinks) and it felt like highway robbery. We both remarked that we wanted to barf it all up so we could have a redo at someplace better. 

For Cinco de Mayo, they had waitresses dressed like they just got off work at Hooters and sporting sombreros. Classy touch.

We won&#39;t be back."

The wild boar and buffalo meatballs were the best meatballs I have ever tasted.  The mussel sauce should have come with a straw (so I could have drank every ounce).

I&#39;ve tried two of their specialty entrees, which change daily - as well as a few of the tapas plates. Everything has been tasty and filling and they have a great wine selection. 

I have to disagree with some of the reviews saying it&#39;s a great deal. $10 per tapas plate, $10 per glass of wine and a shared entree (I have no idea what the entrees cost) - both times our bill has exceeded $70. There are two $6 red wine options, but the average price, I would say, is $10 and the costliest is $15. Maybe it&#39;s my fault because I&#39;m not very economical when it comes to food. I want what I want and I will pay for it, so my tab climbs.

The only other thing I would change (besides slightly lowering the prices or offering a kick-ass happy hour menu), and again it&#39;s personal preference, is that I&#39;d like to see a few lighter options on the menu. Everything I&#39;ve had, while very good, has been really heavy on the cream in the sauces. It feels very rich and fattening.

While we waited, the owner was very happy to tell us about the restaurant and some of the cool things they do, like wine tastings and sourcing their food locally.  Also how they salvaged a bar from Michigan(I think) and repurposed their bar as the bar that&#39;s at this place now. Pretty cool!

Our server was a little out of it that night. Super friendly, but struggled a bit with getting our orders right. She did make sure our drinks were full- huge plus!

We were greeted enthusiastically at the door. The service was extremely friendly. This is a relatively small restaurant with about 15 or so tables. There are more tables on the patio. The restaurant is split by a big wall in the middle. This makes it seem smaller than it is.

During our meal, a couple at an adjacent table was doding over their screaming baby. Folks, please don&#39;t take your screaming baby to a wine bar! Acres is friendly and intimate, but it really is the wrong atmosphere for a child.

The wife and I had several plates and a bottle of sparkling wine. The gnocci mac and cheese is worth trying with a very silky cheese sauce. The andouille sausage is tasty, but not the best value. We also had the fried tomato caprese which was one of my favorite items. It offers a unique spin on a classic. We finished with fried chicken legs. Both my wife and I enjoyed the chicken, but the breading was overcooked and tasted a little burned. There&#39;s a careful balance to be had there, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll work it out in the future. The biscuits that come with the chicken were so good that we ordered more.

Our meal was finished by the creme brulee trio which our server took it upon herself to buy for us. Maybe it was the screaming baby, or maybe it was becasue it was our first time in. Whatever the reason for the comp, it was delicious! The creme brulee trio was flavored with chai tea, bourbon and maple, and vanilla. Each flavor was unique, and it added a pleasant, sweet finish to our meal.

Service was what put this place over the top. We received very personal service, and it made it worth every penny. Our items and our wine cost around $80, so Acres can get pricey, but it doesn&#39;t have the stuffiness of a high-price fine dining establishment, and I got the distinct impression that they care whether or not we return. And return we will, becuase this restaurant is close to our home, offers unique food, and has five-star service."

After reading all of the amazing reviews on the biscuits of course we orderes them.  Well the reviews were spot on, even after finishing them I found myself mindlessly dipping my finger in the left over butter  (yum).  Along with the biscuits we got the fried red tomato caprese again heavenly.

Time for dinner, my husband got the scallops with succotasch and I got the pork belly carbonara.

The vivid colors of the corn, peas and cherry tomatoes  show the freshness. Scallops were perfectly seared.

4 generous pieces of porkbelly topped fresh pasta with bright green peas loking through the sauce.  Although this is a rich dinnernit was not overdone.

Unfortunately time did not allow us to sample the desserts, for sure next time.

The ambiance is on point, like a bustling library, busy enough to enjoy the company, yet quiet enough to enjoy the intimacy. Walking into Acres, you are greeted not only by the lovely staff (who almost always seem to remember your name and drink of choice) but also the sweet aroma of their sublime dishes.

From gnocchi mac and cheese, a clever twist on an original, to their sinfully simple caprese, that melts in your mouth, their focused menu highlights the best of the season and caters to every whim of your taste buds. 

Their wine selection is simply superb (you know the owner, John Benson, is a wine whiz, right?) and their sangria to their concise but effective beer selection compliments any and every meal. 

In short, Acres has been an utter disappointment for one reason: once you&#39;ve dined at Acres all others pale in its comparison."

The decor is very cute and unique.  We did have to wait for a few minutes to get a table, but we were seated and served promply. We ordered the gnocchi mac n cheese,  fried chicken, fried tomato caprese, and porkbelly. All the food was rich and delicious. It was more than enough for 3 people. Family style comfort food at its finest. The service and atmosphere are very welcoming and comfortable. It is expensive,  but worth the money.

The service was not disappointing, either. The house wine was not good though; the Pinot Noir tasted like it&#39;d been from a long open bottle. Ordered four dishes and the only one that really stood out was the artichoke. The fried chicken was good but expensive. The gnocchi mac n cheese was just OK. Did not like the olive tapenade at all.

I like the idea that they are trying to do tapas style dining in this neighborhood, but the dishes need to blow me away at the the portion size/price point they are offering."

The party&#39;s host was told by the owner that they could handle a large group and would have extra staff on hand. Really sorry to say that there were just too many mistakes made for me to not write this review with the hope that in the future they would either refuse a large group or will have upped their game enough to accomodate a large party. i know that it had been suggested to the party&#39;s host that it would be easier if the menu was fixed for the group but our host wanted people to be able to experience what they wanted to try on the menu. I wonder if that would have made that much of a difference because honestly the food I did finally get to try (after an hour and a half after ordering three dishes, we only received two of the dishes and after asking to cancel the third dish our overwhelmed waitress had to go ask somebody if that was possible? Really?) was... almost okay? The roasted beet salad that was on special that night for $12 had almost raw beets in it and the portion was small for that price. The gnocchi and cheese flavor was okay but the gnocchi were very heavy and doughy. I wonder what the meatloaf sliders might have tasted like? No actually, I can imagine what they might have been like because the other 5 or 6 orders of them at our table were not completely consumed even after the extraordinarily long wait (even between orders? We ordered the sliders long before others at the table and we and people across from us never received ours while people sitting around us eventually did? Did they really cook only two or three orders at a time when there were multiple orders? Strange.). I almost feel that this review is unfair since we were such a large group but as I mentioned before, they thought that they could handle it. Fail. Miserably."

We had to move due to a very unstable, wobbly table. We were taking our friend out for his birthday, which I regretted at that point.

It&#39;s nice to have a restaurant worth going to that isn&#39;t in the Highlands. But that said, I was between 4 and 5 anyway, so that just pushed it over the edge.

Our whole family went and my wife, my two kids and I all gave it a strong 9 out of 10. Great beet salad, fantastic gnocchi mac and cheese, amazing tater tots. The shrimp and grits could have used a bit of salt, but that&#39;s not a huge knock. We had a great glass of Malbec too.

Great happy hour too. From 4-6 there are $4 glasses of wine and $2 off every small plate. Can&#39;t beat that!

I enjoyed the wine list and husband liked the CO-based beer list, This is definitely a great addition to the neighborhood, but as someone else already mentioned, my wallet AND my waist wouldn&#39;t allow me to visit very often!"

We traveled all the way from San Diego to try this spot. It&#39;s pretty quiet if you arrive at 5:00pm but by 7:00pm the tables are packed and the bar is totally alive!! We had a smorgasbord of things.. tater-tots, gnocchi mac-n-cheese, shrimp n grits, fried tomato caprese, venison chili, biscuits, country fried steak and gravy, pork fries, meatloaf sliders.. everything was delicious and we came to the conclusion that the gravy from the country fried steak should be offered as a beverage and the cheese from the mac-n-cheese can go on ANYTHING!! Service was awesome, staff is so friendly - even the chef, Dylan, came out to thank us for stopping in and ensure we had enough to eat. Drinks were great too! I had a glass of wine, a blend, &#34;The Path&#34;, my husband did a local beer &#34;The Lava&#34; Wit and friends did Ballast Point.

We also noticed the sugar free Apple Pie Dessert with S.F. Vanilla ice cream on the side. Now, the parking was a nightmare! We fought two cars filled with old ladies haha. We were lucky. There is very limited parking so plan ahead. This restaurant was refreshing to find because it&#39;s 24 hours of operation with full bar, full tables and booth. Their menu has everything in it from Italian, Mexican, Sea Food Specials and of course, American. Most prices are as standard as most spots: Ranging from 5.49-12.99. 

Their appetizer selection was already a mouthful-- Potato Skins ($9) came with bacon bits and cheese. They had a full plate of Irish Nachos, which were interesting! 

The service was fast-- the food took almost 45- Hour. Amanda G. Was fantastic and stayed active with us the whole time! She constantly communicated with us, filled my friend&#39;s cup of coffee-- twice!!! She replaced a dish I wasn&#39;t satisfied with and brought in something better. 

MCCoy&#39;s managed to master American food with no problem; I wasn&#39;t impressed with their Chicken Fettuccini with Broccoli and Mushrooms- I hate pasta and it appeared dry with no flavor. In exchange I received the Chop Sirloin Steak which was definitely fantastic!! It had a side of veggies, mashed potatoes, and well made steak. The Belgium Waffle was huge and unfortunately, it took coats and coats of syrup AND honey to make it more settling. 
It does include a side of bacon and/or sausages.. 

My friend loved the Biscuit Plus, which included the side of eggs! It went well with a cup of coffee and I frankly-- chose the strawberry lemonade. No dessert in the end, but we shall return!"

Be very specific when ordering. Read the menu carefully. I usually order a bacon omelette, but for some reason, they love to put onions in it. I always order &#34;bacon Omelette, no cheese, no onions, no toast&#34;. Somehow, it always has onions in it, so the cook gets to remake it. I also usually get toast.

The mashed potatoes weren&#39;t even real and the vegetables were cold. They even tasted like they were frozen.

My daughter and I went here based on the Yelp reviews.  I don&#39;t know what kind of restaurants that most of the people who reviewed this place go too, but if they think this deserves 4 stars, I wouldn&#39;t want to eat at any of the other places where they do.  I ordered the bison burger and was highly disappointed.  I didn&#39;t even realize that there was such a thing as a bison patty, but they had it.  It was totally tasteless.  If I had known it was going to be a pre-frozen patty, I would have chosen another item on the menu, or a much better restaurant, for that matter. I visit Denver quite frequently and love bison burgers and have always had freshly made burgers and never been disappointed, that is, until tonight.  We decided to take our dessert home with us and ordered the strawberry shortcake.  We refrigerated it when we got home, since no mention was made of ice cream.  Two hours later, when we opened the container, imagine our surprise that there was now vanilla mush on top of stale cake and strawberries.

The Béarnaise sauce was separated and was not that good. Very small piece of Canadian bacon on the eggs Benedict showed me not much care in the kitchen. There was plenty of hash browns but very under cooked. Below average at best.  For fun I ordered the fried mushrooms. There was plenty to eat. It&#39;s an appetizer for two.

Went here with Hubs while meeting my friend and her family for a late dinner.  Thankfully this Diner is closer to where we need to be, and closest to where my friend live.  Furthermore, my friends like to eat in this kind of establishment, so it was a win-win situation.

When we arrived, man this place just the outside, aka parking is filled with the brim.  To our surprise, this establishment is BIGGER inside as compared when you look it from outside.  We opt to be seated at one of the booths, and our lovely server brought us to the left wing of this establishment.  Our server her name is Shauna.

What????  The Menu is so extensive, until both Hubs and I cannot decide.  Hmmm, decisions, decisions, decisions.....  All look so good, but will it be, I whisper inside??  Anyhoos, while waiting for our friend to arrive, both Hubs and I decide to order an Appetizer first. 

The service was prompt and efficient. 

Hubs opt to have a Large Soda ($2.19) while the rest of us opt to have water as part of our beverages.

We shared the Irish Nachos ($7.29) as part of our Appetizer.  It comes with potato chips, melted cheese, corned beef and sour cream.  Hubs like the combination ALOT.  Hubs LIKE this dish ALOT!!  He was literally eating the whole dish by himself...  Hubs gave this dish 4 SOLID Stars!  

Hubs Main Entrée order was Momma Meatloaf ($7.99).  Hubs was disappointed with his Main Entrée, though the Meatloaf was good, the side dishes aka the vegetables was just overcooked to the MAX!

I opt for the Captain Platter ($12.99).  This dish comes with Battered Fish Fillets, Fried &#34;Butterflied&#34; Shrimp and your choice of sides.  The Sides I opt for was with French Fries.  It also comes with somekind of Coleslaw of somekind, Cocktail Sauce and Tartar Sauce.  This Captain Platter comes with 2 Breads and whipped Butter.

My friend and her hubby opt to have Bacon Burger ($7.49), and Western Burger ($6.99).  I could not recall who order what that evening, but they said their order was good since at the end of their dinner, everything that was on their plate was gone.

Total cost for the whole dinner was $48.54 with tax.  For the food and the pricing it was reasonable and the portion are huge for some.  Personally it was A-Okay for me, though I think Hubs is in &#34;love&#34; with the Irish Nacho and Hubs said He does not mind returning to McCoys just to have the Irish Nacho.  Possible returns to this establishment.

Pay your check at the Cashier Up Font.

Left this establishment at about 21:30hrs ish.

Or, maybe when you&#39;re just out way too late and you&#39;re starving and don&#39;t want fast food.

My friend suggested this little gem after we went to a concert; the awesome show left us way too jacked to just go home and go to bed. 

I ordered the &#34;irish nachos,&#34; which consisted of a HUGE platter of fresh made thick cut potato chips covered in cheese, corned beef, and green chili. Don&#39;t ask how green chili is &#34;irish&#34; but it worked (confession: I shoved all the corned beef aside). I ate maybe 1/4 of the plate and was stuffed. My friend had the chicken fried steak (or was it chicken fried chicken? it all looks the same to me) and demolished it. 

Service here gets 5 stars. Waitress was efficient, friendly, and did not hesitate to make recommendations when asked. She was a bit sassy, which I loved. She kept the drinks refilled and made sure to check on us a few times."

The food fills the tummy, the specials seldom do any wowing, and the service is okay mostly because the wait staff are efficient, but pretty unenthusiastic about anything, especially one more customer. There are cheaper places with the same quality food, but it&#39;s pretty close to reasonably priced that I can&#39;t complain too much there. This place is mostly worthy of only 2 stars, but the consistency of the food over the years earns an extra star."

They&#39;re open 24 hours , serve breakfast all day and, as a plus, they have a full bar and serve &#34;a little hair of the dog that bit ya&#34; when you need it after a night out. They have the standard type of menu for their genre, the portions are good sized, and they do some things pretty well. They&#39;re not hand pressing truffles for fresh oil in the back by any means but, I think if you asked for truffle oil here, they would either throw you out or haul you in back and smack you around a little. They&#39;re decidedly unfancy but, they&#39;re not trying to be anything other than what they are. McCoy&#39;s is solid for what it is."

You walk in and there is a an old nasty, greasy smell that just hits you when you enter the door. The place is constantly packed which is fine, but the service lacks when it is. 

The food is just grease, and processed crap. A few hours later my stomach is feeling the pain of eating their food. It takes about a day to get the nasty aftertaste out of your mouth. 

We usually went there for breakfast, and one day I decided to have lunch instead. I got the tuna melt. You can tell the tuna salad came from a container. Floors were dirty, seats, ripped and dirty, and I was wondering how long it had been since the place was dusted.

I wonder if a lot of things are prepared in Chef Microwave instead of cooking it."

I ordered the French toast coated with oats and cinnamon and powdered sugar, with eggs and sausage links. 

It was delicious and not overly crunchy but it was feeling. I couldn&#39;t even finish my last piece of f toast though i tried. The sausage had a snap and i tasted some honey in it.

Negatives: Some of the booths are looking pretty ancient - cracked vinyl seats and older looking tables.

I understand that isn&#39;t their thing, but it is mine.

Several around the table got the &#39;6 oz&#39; sirloin and eggs (although all of the steaks were substantially bigger than 6 oz), which came with hashbrowns and very good sized pancakes for under $6.  Surprisingly, the steaks even came out medium rare as requested (which is terribly uncommon for a breakfast steak).  I opted for a chorizo skillet that came with green chili, a roasted jalapeno, two eggs, a large tortilla, and potatoes for a little over $7.

The characters make the place. The food was meh. The server was decent.

I had a Gyro that was pretty greasy beyond normal Gyroness. The tomatoes on the Gyro tasted like they were salsa. Hmm..

Fries were pretty average to gross. Ketchup for the fries tasted like some Institutional Food Service brand and not even Del Monte or Hunts.

My coke was okay but I was disappointed that 2/3 of the cup was shaved ice.

The server greeted us and did check up on us - but she really didn&#39;t go above and beyond.

Bought a $1 Colorado Lottery scratch off from the vending machine in the vestibule that returned $4. Sad that this was the highlight of my visit.

Overall, meh. I don&#39;t hate it enough not to come back but at the same time I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go again anytime soon. Then again I was sober this visit so YMMV."

Basically the only thing that I get simply because it&#39;s one of my favorite meals in Denver is the Monte Cristo sandwich with fresh potato chips.  This isn&#39;t a tradiional Monte Cristo but I&#39;ve come to prefer it the way they prepare it --- grilled instead of deep fried.  You still get powdered sugar and raspberry preserves.

 I started eating here regularly this last month because they are partners with my United Mileage Plus program. I have to say I&#39;m glad. I enjoy having several places I frequent regularly that have good food. So far I have had great service and quick and correct hot and delicious food every time. I took my family and they all said they wanted to come back. Eating there for several weeks in a row I noticed it has a huge regular crowd. Waitress&#39;s new everyone. That&#39;s my kind of place. 
The day my family went the chef owner was there doing it all, which was refreshing to see. He was very polite and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. 
 Finally if I had to complain it would about there cosmetics. Maybe some new booths and some deep cleaning and or paint. The parking lot is kinda small. But not small enough to keep me away. It does have great freeway access . So far my favorite part is quick service and 3 miles per dollar and the waffles."

While the service isn&#39;t always the quickest or most attentive - it&#39;s a little hit and miss - the waitresses are all sweeties and will def. recognize and welcome you if you&#39;re a regular, which is awesome.

People sit at the counter, sip coffee from brown mugs, and nod in their trucker hats. What makes McCoys unique is that these said patrons are actually truckers, not unemployed social media consultants who wear trucker hats.

Unlike chains, the food at McCoy&#39;s is fresh with a diverse menu, ranging from Mexican to American. Plus, this fine diner serves beer and cocktails, even though they don&#39;t knock you over the head with a giant bar lit with LEDs.

I will definitely come back whether its a hangover hair of the dog breakfast or a late night potato skin craving, McCoy&#39;s is sweet."

I had their famous fresh homemade cinnamon roll. It was absolutely amazing.

I am a bit of a health nut, so I with that they had more appetizing health options. But there are plenty of places to go to get health food. This is a quality place to go consume as many yummy calories you can."

After months and months of staying up nights wondering what happened in there, I dragged my girlfriend in for some brunch.

And I am now happy I did.  This restaurant is as big and impressive as its menu.  I&#39;ve now been twice for brunch and twice I have left satisfied with my meal.  Everything is very reasonably priced - even the drinks from the full-bar won&#39;t discourage you.  Can you really go wrong with $3 Bloody Mary&#39;s all day everyday?  

Now, you may run in to and/or eat amongst some characters, and you may begin to wonder why there&#39;s a HUGE Burger King sign in the parking lot nowhere near Burger King...  but... they&#39;ve obviously been doing something right to continue to thrive for 20+ years, even after the Village Inn moved in right across the street.

Why McCoy&#39;s and not Village Inn across the street?
A) Village Inn is ghetto
B) McCoy&#39;s has booze!
C) McCoy&#39;s has a Patio overlooking the beautiful freeway
D) The servers seem to know everyone&#39;s name and recommend something specific, just for you

My eggs benedict was not fantastic, the holandaise was a bit weird and waaaaay too neon yellow. But, this would not deter me from heading back here to try something else. The steak and eggs looked pretty damn good and you can&#39;t beat the price of $6. I&#39;m thinkin I&#39;ll be back for a breakfast burrito and a bloody mary some time ;)"

This review is LONG overdue. My boyfriend and I love dives. Fun places where you don&#39;t have to worry about other uptight a holes win-win. However, I am convinced my boyfriend almost didnt make it . We frequent here all the time, different times and eat different things.I never thought their food was outstanding by any stretch , but we usually have a pretty good server, who doesnt forget us and thats what I like almost more than anything. My boyfriend ordered the burger, one of many. We ate , left , carried on with our business. Well and behold, I am awoken to his reversal of fortune in the middle of the night. . I check the time, within a very few hours from eating,  I ask if he&#39;s had other problems to match his thowing up , he confirms. I am convinced he ate something bad. Sick within a few hours from eating pretty sure. Yet,  we make another trip to McCoys. Not immediately following but we go again. I suggested to him not to order the burger, he ignores me. We eat , we leave, we go to bed. I again, am waking up to him completely THROWING UP seriously throwing up , he reminded me of a highschool girl drinking for her first time. You know, the cute kid who wanted to be so cool, claiming she can &#34;drink like a man&#34; only to be so completely wasted she&#39;s wretchin so hard you think she&#39;s lost her spleen. Ya , that was my boyfriend. Poor guy. We both made a vow; we&#39;re not going to McCoys... Which kinda does suck since Ive come here for so long over so many years but I do value both my boyfriend and nights of uninterupted rest.


P.S. The bathrooms sometimes smell like piss-not sure if its the bums making their way in or whats going on with that but definately not something you can really feel all that assured with knowing the bathroom is literally sharing a corner with the kitchen"

Portions are big and certain dishes are down-home. Daily specials are great deals. The staff is nice - sometimes the young-uns are not all that knowledgeable, but if you explain what you want/need in detail, they will try. Patronage is diverse and interesting to watch. You know,  people-watching is a favorite past time of mine - good place for it most any time.

Beer specials are awesome, bloodies are tasty."

YES, it may not be the finest food in all of Denver, but when you are looking for some great home cooking, this is where it&#39;s at. *Try the Greek Omelette!!*

A friend and I go here about once every two weeks, and each time we have been satisfied to the point of needing a bigger belt. 

Now here&#39;s why I can&#39;t give 5 stars. The servers just don&#39;t care about you. They will sit and chat with their friends, or whoever, and COMPLETELY ignore you. And I&#39;m not talking about &#34;They&#39;ll look at you and nod and eventually get to you&#34;....I mean....TOTALLY ignore. Often I wonder if my being there and spending money is an inconvenience to the servers.

With that said, there is ONE server I am sure to request, Cassie. She is always a bundle of great energy. She took the time to write down our names and try to memorize it before the end of our 1st visit. She remembers us as best she can and always makes our visit a good one. The chef/owner is great too. He seems to always take time out of the kitchen to check on the customers...even running to get us bloody marys when Cassie was a little swamped. Those two, combined with the food, make McCoy&#39;s a great little place.

In conclusion....GO HERE....just request Cassie!"

However, there&#39;s not much I think I can do about it after visiting McCoy&#39;s late on a Friday night. Methinks I will never return to McCoy&#39;s. It&#39;s basically one of the dirtiest places in which I&#39;ve ever eaten. Even knowing not to expect the best from a late-night service, I can&#39;t go back.

Our booth was incredibly grubby--the end of it showed no signs of being cleaned, enhanced by the video game installed at the end of the booth that was bedecked with greasy, dirty finger prints all over--and the cleanliness of the place overall was reminiscent of a ghetto gas station. The walk to the bathroom, which passes the kitchen, made my stomach flip-flop. When I returned to the booth and sat across from my dining partner, we exchanged a mutual look of &#34;should we leave?&#34; 

We didn&#39;t leave; instead, we choked down the food with immense apprehension. From the other reviews, I gathered that this would be a good late-night place where I could get some diner food to soak up some alcohol. I&#39;m not squeamish when it comes to cheap dives and diner food that lacks class, as long as I can see an effort to be clean. The food did match my (fairly low) expectations for diner grub and nothing was wrong with the service, but I can&#39;t get over the probable health-code violations. The place may be cleaner during other times of the day, but my instincts tell me that the carelessness of it will always be lurking. Either way, I just can&#39;t give it another chance."

McCoy&#39;s has become my favorite little breakfast joint with loads of good eats and at a teeny little price. 
I love to people watch the locals that eat there, not your typical buff &amp; sexy 20-somethings I&#39;m used to seeing in Denver, if you catch my drift!

Ate breakfast at McCoys this morning since they are across the lot from my hotel.  Good portions, fast service.  Pretty disappointed in the friendliness.  Would have been nice to be asked if my food was OK, if I needed anything else.. certainly wasn&#39;t because they were too busy.

So, still stuck here this evening, walked back over from my hotel for dinner.  Hey, at least the portions for breakfast were good.  So the bison burger was overcooked, the fries were cold and hard (worst I&#39;ve ever had), and my food was set in front of me without a word.  It wasn&#39;t that Shannon (my waitress) was unfamiliar with the concept of friendliness as she sat down at the table behind me and laughed it up with her friends/regulars.

If you like cinnamon rolls, this is your place. They are as big as a dinner plate with warm, gooey, cinnamon roll stuff on top. Do not think about the calories.

We like it so far!

A red from Willamette
we picked Cloudline

Duck, bison and scallops

The restaurant was airy with a variety of styles of tables throughout. Large windows allowing lots of natural light shining  within the space. A Farm to Table restaurant always ranks highest on my culinary list...

Dined out with a colleague and we both ordered the same entree (clearly she has good taste also). I began with Tables Leaves as the restaurant&#39;s moniker for salads. I ordered the Romaine leaf, Parmesan &amp; Caesar dressing (no croutons). However, to my surprise the salad was topped with anchovies and a smile framed my face &amp; tummy. Yum! Next, I ventured to the Head of the Tables, named for entrees and selected Jumbo wild scallops, mint, Fava bean-escarole (minus Hannibal Lector) &amp; Saffron risotto. An exceptionally pleasing meal with plump scallops and the hint of mint with the risotto was mouthwatering. I highly recommend this entree as superb.

I had 2 cocktails (a rum mixture drink) disappointedly I can only remember part of the name, Bella?? Smooth, mildly sweet and not too strong so that more than one could be consumed and not feel intoxicated..

I was too full for End Tables, desserts but as I&#39;m writing this review wished I had of gotten the Lemon-Berry Cake with Lavender frosting or the Strawberry &amp; Rhubarb Key Lime pie w/ ginger snap crust.

Best of all it was paired with a bread and butter pickle bread pudding, which I know sounds crazy but was absolutely incredible.

Our waitress tonight was friendly, attentive and fun. All in all another excellent meal at Tables. Highly recommend!!!"

My husband and I had dinner here last night for Valentine&#39;s Day and I was so impressed by everything, food AND service-wise.  The restaurant was cozy and romantic, our server had that professional-but-not-too-stiff thing down to a T and the food... just incredible!  They had a four-course special menu with three choices for each course and I was blown away by every single thing I ate.  Personal favorites were the house papperdelle with duck ragu and the butternut mac and cheese.  A truly incredible dining experience."

We took my mom here for Mothers Day dinner this year. The name &#34;Tables&#34; is very fitting for the restaurant&#39;s name with all the different types of antique and eclectic tables - small, big, round, square, different colors and heights. It&#39;s a cozy and homey sort of ambiance, almost like you&#39;ve been transported back to a mid-1900&#39;s Southern town. 

We continued to get a warm and fuzzy feeling from our server, who was such a nice guy. His service was open and almost as if he felt like he was serving us in his own home. We nearly forgot we were in a restaurant. 

They don&#39;t allow you to use their WiFi and service is really hard to get inside the restaurant, which explains the lack of many pictures given how long this place has been around. We tasted something from all sections of the menu - a salad and soup of the day, the tuna appetizer, we each got a different entree (ratatouille, lamb and the burger) and we had the smores for desert. We all enjoyed everything. Something we ordered was delayed or forgotten and our desert was comped. 

All and all, it was a good value for a nice cozy dinner. I can see why this place will stick around."

We discovered Tables when I took my husband there for his 30th birthday.  We had the tuna tartar appetizer and quail, the pork chop and scallops were both incredible. The bread pudding and pumpkin cheesecake were to die for.  

We&#39;ve been back frequently since and never had a bad meal.  I love the butter they have with the bread basket and I don&#39;t even eat butter normally.  They switch up their menu each season so it&#39;s great to try new things.  Last summer, they had this pork chop with palisade peaches that I still dream about...

We were just there last night with a group of friends and got to try the new 2015 spring menu.  The lamb loin and ratatouille were delicious! The double chocolate smores are amazing.  My husband loved the pistachio cheesecake.

Must try this place!"

I didn&#39;t know what this place was for the longest time. We use the groomer right next door and I never knew there was this hidden gem right there! We went here for our very first date after having our first baby. It was just close enough to home but just far enough away... :) 

Excellent meal! All the courses were on point. Unique and fun dishes that change with the season and what&#39;s locally available. Our drinks were tasty (and strong) too! 

It may not look like much from the outside but I highly recommend this restaurant and plan to go back... often!"

The burger of the day was spot on. The flavor combo was perfection. 
The scallops were melt in your mouth heaven and the risotto AMAZING!! Not one complaint.

tables-denver,Krishna C.,Pz9EY8X9AIHD6VemtLrVGg,"Atlanta, GA",1,1,0,28,56,JIanhPKFaPGn4MyWwVD56w,4.0,2015-10-21,"Everything about this restaurant is perfect.  It&#39;s tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood of Denver.  There&#39;s a small strip of businesses around Tables and Christmas lights were hung between the trees and buildings, very charming.  

My friend and I had a reservation for 7:30 pm on a Saturday night, however we arrived at 6:50 hoping to snag a table early, if available.  The host and maitre d (the older lady of the two) both said the table would not be ready until closer to 7:15 and suggested there was a wine bar across the street.  We walked over to the wine bar and learned they were having a private party.  Thankfully there are benches in front of some businesses and we parked ourselves there for a bit.  

At 7:25 we entered Tables again and as the host was about to say something, the rude maitre d rushed over to tell us (and the host) the table would not be ready until 7:30! Goodness, can you be nicer about it and offer a seat at the bar?  Thankfully the host did offer a seat at the bar until the table was ready.  We reviewed the wine menu and as we were about to order, the host seated us at our table. 

I can&#39;t remember our server&#39;s name but he was a very friendly gentleman; for reference, we sat in the back room, on the corner benches by the wall.  Having seen the menu (online) that morning we both had an idea of what we wanted to order.  We asked for sweetbreads as an appetizer instead of side dish (as it&#39;s listed) and our server said that wouldn&#39;t be a problem.  He asked us if we knew what they are and we all chuckled.  He said he gets customers that think sweetbreads are bread that is sweetened and once the plate arrives, realize what it isn&#39;t, they ask to take it back.  Sweetbreads are pancreas or thymus gland.  The dish came with carrots, squash, onions and bacon braised in a wine sauce.  The sweetbreads were perfect and the entire dish was phenomenal.  As my friend said &#34;it&#39;s sweetbreads with bacon, what&#39;s not to love?&#34;  I highly recommend ordering it at Tables.  

For dinner we each got a meaty entree.  Mine was new york strip steak with mushroom polenta and cherry tomatoes and my friend ordered bison with butternut squash gratin and green beans.  Both of our meats were cooked to medium rare and delicious.  The chimichurri sauce one my steak was the perfect addition to the meat.  My friend said the bison was perfect for her taste and juniper berry reduction was a nice touch while the gratin was rich and creamy.  

Having worked in the restaurant industry, I understand the importance of delivering perfectly cooked and seasoned food in a timely manner because the customer is paying top price.  At Tables the prices aren&#39;t low but the entire experience of great service, food and atmosphere are part of the price.  

Mind you, you are also paying to watch an obnoxious customer change the menu and ingredients to make their own made-up dish.  Two tables over a (heavily plastic botoxed) woman and her husband took a long time to order, asking the server ridiculous questions about substitutions.  After he walked away she changed her mind and reordered everything.  Yes, we had one of those near us.  (A word of note to those customers, if you change things around to fit your ridiculous diet, don&#39;t bother going to a restaurant, everyone in the kitchen will hate you for your requests.)  

A note about the bread.  Our server brought out the bread (and refilled) timely but we were both feeling meh about the room temperature bread.  If the bread is going to be provided on the house, it should be warm!  The butter sprinkled with sea salt slightly made up for the average bread.  

Docking one star for the mean maitre d and average bread but overall I am glad we tried this restaurant while visiting Denver; a great experience."

This was one of the best dining experiences I have had on a vacation - without a local friend recommendation, thanks Yelp - in a long time. It was quiet and yet busy, a lovely space with a variety of antique tables all spaced well so you felt like you weren&#39;t sitting right on top of each other. Our server was efficient, pleasant and always here with something before we knew we needed it.

It&#39;s a much more casual place than you&#39;d think. Shorts and small kids are welcome. As with most places in Denver, dog friendly on the patio. It&#39;s not a pop in for dinner on a whim place really...at $25 or so per entree, it&#39;s a place for most of us to go on a special occasion.

I started with a scrumptious salad: Summer fig, cherry &amp; house made black pepper-ricotta flat bread with creamed honey for $12. You may think $12 for a salad is crazy. But the taste combination was perfect - perfect! I could put the creamed honey on everything I ever eat from now until the end of time. 

I had the grilled pork dish. The peaches were a lovely touch adding so much to the soft juicy meat. It came with blue cheese and I requested it left off. They did. 

The wife - who was there to celebrate her birthday - had the herb smeared NY strip. Yummy! Cooked perfect. My pork wins dinner though...it was just that good! A nice touch when our waiter came up he said he heard &#34;someone was celebrating a birthday&#34; And thanked her for choosing to celebrate her special day with them. A candle came out on her dessert.

This is their summer menu I am reviewing. So by the time you get there it all will be different. I envy you getting to go each season and enjoy such fresh and well prepared food.

The wine list was not too large as to overwhelm you and most everything I could want was by the glass. I even had a lovely port with dessert.

I would certainly recommend this for a nice dinner out in Denver. It looked like most tables were 2 and 4 tops. So keep that in mind if you have a large group."

It was great back then, so decided to take a chance and schedule a 1st date there.  Kind of risky, trying to make a good impression for a 1st date and making reservations at a place that I hadn&#39;t been to in awhile.  

Wow!  Am I glad I took a chance.  When I called for the reservation, I mentioned that it was a 1st date.  They called back leaving a message that they would do what they could to make it a pleasant experience.  

I arrived before my date did.  The hostess ushered me to a corner table next to the window.  Perfect!  It was a very cozy, romantic spot that afforded a bit of privacy as well.  She even asked for my dates name to ensure that he was promptly seated.

The service was spot on as well.  Our server was attentive, without being intrusive, allowing plenty of much appreciated time for uninterrupted conversation.   The food was impeccable.  The appetizer didn&#39;t appeal to my date, but that was my shortsightedness and no reflection on the server nor the kitchen (I found the sweetbreads delightful)!  We both ordered the scallops as entrees.  Amazing!  They arrived with a delicious, crispy sear outside and tender succulence inside.  The scallops were served on a bed of risotto that was so creamy that I could have easily mistaken it for dessert!

So, thank you Tables for an absolutely impressive 1st date experience!  

And yes, I do believe that there will be a 2nd date with this fella in the near future!   ;-)"

Menu changes seasonally to keep your taste buds engaged.  Burger of the day, which isn&#39;t always a &#34;burger&#34;, keeps things fun and interesting.  Wine list is not extensive, but very well appointed and reasonably priced.  Last night I had the Arctic Char (tastes like a cross between Trout &amp; Salmon), and it was nothing short of perfect.

My dining companion enjoyed their Caesar salads and my Sweetbread appetizer was perfect. The broth was so good I had the waiter bring a fork and more bread to absorb the spicy tomato goodness. Could it get better? Yes. My dinner companions enjoyed their steak and a chop and my duck breast was better than expected. Loved the accompanying sauce and pasta. As an end the apple pecan pie was nice.

The only drawback for us was the new space. I&#39;m sorry to say but, the restaurant&#39;s theme is &#34;tables&#34;, much of it&#39;s charm comes from the assortment of antique tables. The new addition doesn&#39;t fit and we were disappointed to be seated there.

First, the restaurant is charming and quaint - a real neighborhood establishment nestled in cute Park Hill. My husband and I went on a Tuesday night and it was packed. There is plenty of patio seating but we were shown to a table indoors near a window. We started with the arugula and beet salad, which they were kind enough to to separate and serve individually as we said we were sharing. The tuna tartar followed and both were delicious. The tuna was a generous portion and very fresh and tasty. My main course was the pan seared trout with crispy artichokes and bacon while my husband had salmon with mushrooms and potatoes. Both fish were cooked to perfection, flavorful and fresh. The only downside was dessert.

There were a few combinations that didn&#39;t quite form the perfect foodie marriage, mostly in the dessert realm, that brought my review down to 3 stars. For example, the coconut creme brulee was a wonderful idea in theory, but in practice, the texture of the coconut and of the creme brulee was a bit of a clash. The peanut butter banana ice cream was the same way; too much banana and not enough peanut butter (and the banana wasn&#39;t very banana-y).

I also thought the ambiance was a little lacking. Yes, Tables has sweet mismatched tables, soft lighting and is in a cozy space, but it didn&#39;t make my heart sing. The decor reminds me a bit of the trendy rustic look that is popular for weddings right now...you know the kind...mason jars, burlap, mismatched china. Sweet but a bit overdone.

Lest you think I am a total Debbie Downer, I will say that there were some amazingly spectacular aspects of Tables, and it wouldn&#39;t take a whole lot of convincing to get me to change my review to a 4. The bread was to.die.for. Our server suggested adding the sea salt to the butter on top and the flavors sung. The mussels with a Belgian Ale broth, pretzel bread and sausage combo was a clever combo that worked. My New York Strip was delicious and the bacon flavored brussels sprouts were the perfect add.

Finally, I would say our server was one of the best I&#39;ve had in town to date. She was gracious, pleasant and enthusiastic about Tables without being overbearing or too much. I wish I had more of a knack for names as I would love to give her a shout out.

Great addition to the Park Hill neighborhood. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be back soon because there are other places I&#39;d like to try, but I would definitely tell others to check it out. Perhaps I might recommend that they go to Cake Crumbs afterward for dessert."

The atmosphere and location are excellent. Unpretentious but serious about what they are doing. Service was lovely, which cinched the fifth star. Wine list is small, but smart. I enjoyed a lovely French bourdeaux. The cuisine is seasonal, and the current late winter menu was very inviting. Appetizer was a spicy carrot soup with a salas garnish. Salad was. Roasted beet and Brussels sprout leaf medley. Not groundbreaking but very tasty. Main course was a crispy skin char and seasonal vegetables. Again, very well thought out with subtle flavors. Dessert. Oh my. Roasted white chocolate ice cream with banana. It&#39;s as good as it sounds! 
They were easily able to accommodate my gluten free needs too! So. I would come here again, anytime. Great for any occasion."

Recommended by a friend so we decided to go with a few couples for dinner on a Friday evening. With 6 of us and a reservation we were seated no problem. At first glance the interior is inviting and unique with a variety of doors both in functional roles and hung around the space. The tables are all very unique and it makes for an interesting conversation piece.

Wine list was extensive with a good selection, which is to be expected in Denver for a restaurant of this caliber. As for the food it was absolutely exquisite, the menu provided a excellent variety and with six of us we all had an opportunity to try bites of quite a few of the dishes. For starters we shared the tuna tartare, pate, and sweetbreads. All of which were absolutely incredible. The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked, the best I&#39;ve ever had. All of the starters offered a very reasonably sized portion perfect for sharing amongst several of us. The mains were also quite good, I had rainbow trout that was cooked perfectly with a great sauce. The scallops that a friend tried were the highlight however, I&#39;ll certainly be heading back to try them again! The server was friendly, knowledgable of the menu, and paid rapt attention. Our wine and water glasses were consistently filled, above average service for Denver.

Absolutely would highly recommend Tables, a perfect date night, with great food options and a fun atmosphere."

Usually when a server rattles of the specials, I think about what I&#39;m going to drink or have for dessert, but she spoke with such passion and knowledge I ordered a special for the first time in my life.  It was so damn good!  Pork loin over cornbread with a peach sauce and other magical stuff.  Really fantastic.  Prior to that we had salad and apps, which were great, and then dessert was wonderful.  

A really fantastic meal.  

The ambiance was great too.  A lot of hip trendy food spots are so loud you can&#39;t talk to each other.  It wasn&#39;t packed while we were there, but it was busy.  We were able to carry on a conversation without having to shout to be heard.  A pleasant change."

Tables is amazing and did not disappoint.  Given the popularity and dining-in after work on Friday, I called ahead an made a reservation to ensure that I&#39;d be seated promptly.  

The wait staff and service was attentive, friendly and offered great recommendations.  Looking over the menu, you can tell the Chef cares about combining fresh, delicious ingredients into complex renditions of familiar dishes.  We ordered the Sauteed Crabcakes, Alaskan Salmon and a Chef special Lamb Cataloni offered that day.  The Salmon was delicious; however, the Lamb Cataloni was AMAZING.  I love lamb and this dish quite possibly had the best lamb I&#39;ve tasted in recent memory.  The flavors blended together in each offering was refreshingly new and left us wanting more with each bite.  We couldn&#39;t stop there, so we ordered the Strawberry-Rhubarb Crisp &amp; Buttermilk-Ginger Sherbet, which surely did not disappoint.  

We talked so much that we actually closed the restaurant down, which is my only issue with Tables.  Tables, as do many restaurants in this part of Denver, closes WAY too early.  I&#39;d recommend closing time was pushed back to 11pm on Friday and Saturday evenings.

I&#39;m looking forward to my next visit!"

I thought that tonight&#39;s menu was poorly suited to the season. It&#39;s 95 degrees out and the menu was very heavy even the special was linguini with sausage - not something I am looking for on a hot summer day.

For mains, we had the trout which was cooked well and came with a tasty panzanella salad of fennel and radish.

We finished with the plum upside down cake with basil creme fraiche which was really disappointing and is the real impetus for 3 rather than 4 stars. For starters it wasn&#39;t an upside down cake at all - a quick look at the bottom (which should be the top if you think of it as upside down) showed that it had been baked in a pan with the fruit on top - not the other way around. It was really a pound cake with a bit of plum on it. The ratio of fruit to cake was way off - way too much cake and not enough fruit or creme fraiche. Again I thought the presentation was messy - the basil was julienned really fine when baby leaves would have been better and the creme fraiche was just kind of there. When you get  a nice bite of all the favors it was good but that only happened a few times.

And our server insisted on calling my wife &#34;miss&#34; which was just bizarre - she&#39;s not twelve. 

I would definitely go back to tables - I think they can do better and and are probably more of a winter restaurant."

It was recommended to me by  David T. when I was looking for a special place to celebrate B&#39;s 40th. And trust me, I became a bit concerned when he updated his 5 star review to 3 stars only a week before our reservation! 

That said, I know that a 3 star review from David doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it was a bad experience and I decided to stay with that selection. I just called in advance and requested a table that wasn&#39;t near the entrance, which they were happy to accommodate. They sat us in the dining room on the right, next to the window.  Perfect.

Our server, Rachel, was fantastic. She asked if we had been to Tables before and we said no, she then explained their philosophy about local and seasonal fare and that they change their menu four times each year. In fact, they had just changed their menu that week. B ordered the Caesar Salad and NY Strip steak, and I ordered the Spinach Salad and the Braised Lamb Shank.

We thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The salad was a nice start and my lamb shank was absolutely gorgeous. Fall off the bone tender and the white bean-fennel-tomato au jus was hearty and savory. It paired very nicely with my Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro. B enjoyed his Caesar and perfectly cooked steak. Very much so.

For dessert we ordered the S&#39;mores to split, which was complimentary as we were celebrating a birthday. This is one of the two dishes Tables keeps on the menu year round (the other being their tuna tartare). The s&#39;mores is very similar to a brownie sundae with a graham cracker crust and toasted marshmallow in place of ice cream. While it was lovely, we don&#39;t usually order dessert and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d order it at $7.

If you are looking for an amazing dining experience that&#39;s outside of the hustle and bustle of downtown and other areas, Tables is definitely worth a visit. You may even see us there."

This quant little place has a classy country hole-in-the-wall type of atmosphere. They use glass jars for the salt and butter and a fresh tulip was on each table. I really loved the attention to detail in this theme for each course of the meal. everything was delicious, down to the bread on the table which tasted like it came from The Denver Bread Co., although I didn&#39;t ask. 

We started with the Soup of the Day which was a spring vegetable soup similar to minestrone, without the beans or meat, which was SOUP-erb.....hehe. but really it was delicious! I had the scallops with garlic cheese orzo, my husband had the Lamb. Both dishes were artfully prepared and had lots of great flavor. To pair with the food we had the house martini, mine with cucumber infused vodka and Sir`s with gin, both were fragrant and tasty. Our waiter and the wait staff were wonderful and attentive. After dinner we each got coffee and desert. The coffee was nice and strong, not that disappointing weak stuff. For dessert I had the vanilla butterscotch pudding with mascarpone whipped cream and almond crunchies.... delightful! Sir had the coconut cake which was good but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a cozy high class meal for a date or visit with a best friend. Definitely put Tables on your list!"

We liked it back then but it is kind of out of the way tucked back in Park Hill thus we just don&#39;t think of it very often.  Tried it again tonight and not really sorry that we did.

Unlike our last visit they were slammed tonight.  Even with a reservation made way in advance we were relegated to a tiny deuce by the front door.  Cold - really cold.  The couple sitting next to us by the front window kept their coats on throughout their meal.  You really need to be aggressive about where they seat you or be prepared to freeze.

Lovely server tonight (Rachel, I believe).  Brought us a couple of flawless martinis to start while we perused the menu and was helpful with recommendations. She was very attentive throughout - funny and conversational - we liked her very much.

My lady friend had a simple green salad ($6) which wasn&#39;t very exciting - no surprise there but my crispy sweetbreads ($14) were very rich and accompanied by lots of bacon which I passed off to her to give her salad a little umph.  Worked out well.

She proceeded with the crispy duck breast, pear and duck confit French toast,
cranberry preserve &amp; black pepper pan sauce ($24).  I&#39;m usually not a fan of duck when dining out - skin is often flabby but this was cooked perfectly.  As is often the case with duck, I thought the accompaniments were overly sweet but I just don&#39;t care for fruit on my protein.

I ordered the scallops ($25) thinking that they would be a lighter alternative after the rich sweetbreads.  Wrong.  The Hatch green chile risotto was rich on its own but accompanied by house made sausage and a parmesan crisp - oink.  I gave half of it away and still couldn&#39;t make it through the remainder.  Tasty but really heavy going for a seafood dish.

I was way full but she wanted to try dessert and selected the Brown-Butter-Pecan Ice Cream Pie, Oatmeal Cookie Crust &amp; Warm Apple Cider Caramel apple.  Not exciting at all - skip this one.

Washed it all down with a Chassagne-Montrachet ($85) - a bit of a splurge but so good.  Light and crisp and helped cut the fat present in both entrees.

So, it was good but not stunningly so, the service was excellent, and there was a nice buzz but not crazy loud.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll go back sometime but not someplace we&#39;ll frequent all the time at this price point ($200+)."

It&#39;s a small intimate restaurant with an open kitchen and decorated with mix matched tables and chairs. Our waiter was knowledgable of the menu and provided several great items. I decided on the scallops and my companion ordered fish.  We both enjoyed glasses of wine. We enjoyed our meal and a great conversation w/out shouting over loud music or noise.

The service is kind, and they all seem to love what they do.  We arrived towards the end of the dinner service, so it wasn&#39;t very busy.  The meal was paced fairly slow, though.  I don&#39;t mind, as I like to sit at the table and sip wine, but if you are in a time crunch, this might not be the best spot.

I started with the tomato-basil bisque, which was divine.  The soup had wonderful fresh flavor and the whispery finish of a great bisque.  The wine list is quite extensive, but I was in the mood for prosecco.  I was hoping for craft cocktails, but the hard liquor selection is very limited.  For my meal, I had the grilled pork with smoked basil-fennel potatoes and a tomato vinegar sauce.  The pork chop was seasoned and cooked nicely.  However, the sauce did not match the flavor profile.  It also permeated the plate, the vegetables and meat were drowned in the sauce, which overpowered the whole dish.  It just managed to miss the mark.  My husband had the same thing and agreed.  My father-in-law had the New York Strip, and he was also disappointed that it was drowned in sauce.  My mother-in-law had the scallops and risotto, reported that the scallops were good, but the risotto was just okay.

We decided to try dessert - the strawberry rhubarb crisp with basil and ice cream.  It was well done, sweet, sour, crispy, crunchy, delightful.

I really like the menu here, it is creative and slightly different.  However, the saucework seems to be overpowering and just not the right compliment to the well-cooked meat."

The wine list is extensive and frequently updated. Their signature martini is absolutely delicious. The service is always prompt and then there&#39;s the food..... Exceptional. 

I highlyyy recommend the tuna tartare to start with.... Having just moved here from Hawaii, I was super skeptical when the couple next to us at the bar said it was some of the best they&#39;ve ever had. It really is THAT good though. They top it off with their housemade &#34;Tables Sauce&#34;... (which you can purchase) and its delicious. 

They&#39;re also really gluten-free-friendly and can make nearly anything on the menu edible for those of us who avoid wheat. Yay!

As far as main courses go... good luck choosing just one thing. The NY strip is perfect and I have a hard time ordering anything else, but the scallops with butternut squash risotto is pretty amazing too. Others have ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken and the pork chop and both received stellar reviews. Seriously, you can&#39;t go wrong.

I&#39;ve never been able to try dessert personally, as they don&#39;t have any gluten free offerings, but I hear that the cheesecake and the smores brownie will change your life. 


All that said, I&#39;ve yet to have a bad or even mediocre experience here and will definitely be back in the future!"

They could not have been nicer!  It was busy but not packed and they seated us at a great table right away.  The waitress offered to whip something up off the menu for our friend who is vegetarian and was spot-on with her other recommendations.  The Tuna Tartar appetizer is delicious and the portion is a really good value for the price.  My Artic Char came highly recommended and was fantastic as well.  Our waitress made really helpful suggestions for wine pairings and we wound up staying for dessert, too.  We lingered and chatted for awhile and had a fantastic time.  Never once did we feel rushed, either.   We will definitely be back, as we all live nearby.  Thanks, Tables!"

Denver has a really immature food scene and this restaurant is an example of that immaturity. Food was mediocre and totally not integrated - meaning you can&#39;t just throw chunks of blue cheese on the pork dish and call it a glaze. And just adding bacon to a dish so it overwhelms all the flavor is a really low (and immature) way to add flavor. We went all out here ordering from all courses since it was a company dinner and paid on the corporate card. But the food was very disappointing.

Let me start by saying I read all negative Yelp reviews before trying a highly-rated restaurant so I know what the worst case scenario could be when we walk into a restaurant. I honestly don&#39;t know what anyone could criticize here!
They have perfected the trinity...
**Atmosphere- Classy/Shabby chic
**Service- our waitress (Amy) was knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients, friendly, and prompt. In other words....perfect!
**Food....Outstanding! My ribeye with Gorgonzola was deeeelicious. As was the dessert, S&#39;mores.  Mmmmmmmmmm
I highly recommend this restaurant. Much like the group of people that recommended it to us! Come, eat, enjoy!"

I feel ashamed that it took me so long to get here, but I can guarantee it won&#39;t take me that long to get back again. And again.

The restaurant is cozy and intimate and has the feel of a French cottage with an eclectic mix of furniture and soft lighting. It&#39;s my perfect idea of a date night space. the menu is small, but so delicious sounding that it&#39;s hard to choose just one dish. However, I had to...

I started off with an endive salad that was topped with gorgonzola, apples, clementines, and a dijon vinaigrette. It was a deliciously tangy start to my meal. For my main course I ordered the mustard and black pepper smeared New York Strip steak, garlic confit Brussels sprouts, and a syrah demi glaze. The steak was cooked perfectly and again the mustard made it a little tangy. Brussels sprouts are my new veggie crush and these didn&#39;t disappoint. And for dessert Nick and I shared the softest, freshest carrot cake I&#39;ve had in quite a while.

Dinner here is a spendy affair - expect to spend over $100 easily for 2 people, but the atmosphere and quality make it money well spent."

wife had been with a friend a few weeks prior.   i wasn&#39;t stoked, maybe b/c of the exterior, doesn&#39;t really seem like the building could house such a solid place.
we showed up without reservations at 6:30.  the bar was busy so they directed us a few doors down the street, where we had a beer and drink and burned 30 min no problem at Neighbors (Neighbors: fun, chatty bartender and staff, couple at the bar was cool to hang with).  very charming, quiet scene in Park Hill, don&#39;t tell anyone.
we ordered everything at once: a $30 bottle of white, the tuna tartar, vegetarian entree, quail on a waffle, and beet salad.  house bread and salt was excellent.  tartar was fresh and very plentiful - outstanding value at $12.  we noticed quite a few other tables had ordered that.  vegetarian comfort food: beans, greens, acorn squash.  it tasted a lot better than that sounds (me being a carnivore), huge portion.  holy crap: the quail on a waffle.  deep fried, with red eye gravy, $14, anybody less than a gluttonous american would have called it a meal on its own.  i want one for breakfast.
beet salad was good, not great, did not matter because we were 3/4 deep in a bottle of wine, the server was really friendly, the nearby customers were fun, and we had great main plates.  the bathrooms were chill.  open kitchen.  the ambiance was French or something, thrown together but very cozy.  we&#39;ve spent much more on much, much less.  the whole scene was buzzing with happy people.  check it out."

I had not heard of it or read about it, we just happened to be in the neighborhood and googled restaurants.  It was the best surprise we could have found.  Everything we ordered was above our expectations.  I love to cook so when I go out (especially to a nice restaurant) I love to find tastes that exceed what I could do at home.  We had the vegetarian entree that included corn flan and succotash, their sea bass special, and the hamburger of the day.  I also had cucumber yogurt soup...delicious.  We were a very happy group.  In addition to the great food and a great wine list was a very nice ambiance and excellent wait staff.  Our waiter, Mike, described the food so well we wanted to try it all.  Definitely a place to return to."

It was good. 

The food and wine were both good. We had a great time. We were seated just off of the kitchen, which I didn&#39;t like the idea of but it wasn&#39;t too bad thanks to good conversation. Spacing seating wise was somewhat tight. I&#39;m a tall guy and found it somewhat limiting, especially with servers and customers walking by often. Our server was knowledgeable and professional, yet friendly too. Everyone in the restaurant was in pleasant spirits and enjoying the food. 

I would say a drawback was the cost. If you were going out for a special occasion, I could understand the splurge. For example, that night a gentleman had brought his fiance there to propose. An example of exorbitant cost, in my opinion, was the salad selection. We ordered two, and it literally took a couple of forks from all four of us to finish them in seconds. One was a couple leaves of lettuce and some cherry tomatoes with a sprinkle of balsamic dressing. The other featured beets and was just as sparse but high on cost. However, I&#39;m not used to dining out so much and definitely not at trendy dining restaurants. If cost does not concern you, or you have a special occasion or relative in town, I would highly recommend this place. It wasn&#39;t too too expensive, but was on the higher end of what I&#39;d feel comfortable paying for the product."

Food - Uhh, yum. I had a couple of glasses of wine (tasty), hubs had a couple of beers (decent selection). We shared the tuna tartare and I&#39;m still dreaming about it... I had the scallops (perfectly cooked, giant, good portion), he had the New York Strip (well seasoned, cooked well, unfortunately I think the piece we got was just a little bit fattier than we prefer...). Shared the rhubarb crisp for dessert - nicely balanced, not too sweet, not too tart... 

Atmosphere/Service - It was a beautiful evening when we went, so we went for a table outside. I was super glad we did... I felt like we had space from the other tables, it was a little quieter, a little more relaxed, and well... an awesome evening. Service was great... proper but not uncomfortably so, everything was pretty spot on.

After running some errands, Hubs and I decide to head to this establishment for a Late Lunch, EARLY Dinner.  Time was about 16:30hrs.  Man, when we came at that hour, this place is indeed jam packed.  We managed to find seats all the way back on the Right Wing of this establishment.  Once seated, we realized, there are The Menu is ALREADY &#34;lay&#34; on the Table itself.  I feel a little odd about this, but just go with the flow.  

From the Menu, I opt for the following items :

*  1 Taco Tripa ($2.00)
*  1 Taco Lengua ($2.00)
*  1 Taco Cabeza ($1.50)

While Hubs opt to have the following items :

*  4 Tacos Bistec ($6.00)
*  1 Burrito Bistec Smothered ($6.75)
*  1 Mexican Soda ($2.50)

The lovely staff brought out the Complimentary Chips and Salsa while we wait for our order to be ready.  Hubs like the Salsa, and Hubs said, it tasted &#34;home-made&#34;...  Once the Complimentary Chips were gone, the Staff comes back with another Plate of Complimentary Chips.  Man, those Chips are indeed addictive perhaps so, we were hungry.  

Our order was sent to our table after like a few minutes of waiting about 16:50hrs ish.  The Taco meat though plenty, its doable.  I am OK with everything I had.  The Tripa is crunchy.  Err, I cannot differentiate between Lengua and Cabeza for this time around, coz both meats looks the same but have different flavors and its definitely tender.

Hubs once again like all the 4 salsa variety that this establishment did offer.  The Burrito Bistec comes with Rice and Beans in it, which Hubs like it a lot.  All in all 3.5 stars for this establishment and we don&#39;t mind returning when needed.

Call ahead in case they close early during their operation hours.  It seems that during Thursdays thru Saturdays this establishment offer LATE EATS till 1 am or so.  SCORE!!

Left this establishment at 17:10hrs.  Many more patrons came by be it while we were there and when we left.

The opening hours for Los Carboncitos (Aurora Location) is as following :

*  Sunday - Wednesday : 9am to 11:00pm
*  Thursday - Saturday : 9am to 1:30am

Over and over again...I was wishing I hadent eaten there.  There was no soap in the ladies room. I don&#39;t mean it was out. ...there were no dispensers or empty bottles.

(Not Tex-Mex--But Mexican!).  You drop in and seat yourself.  I was happy to see homemade corn tortilla&#39;s on the front of the menu.  Something to look forward too! So we ordered.  Me, I ordered chicken breast, beans, rice, salad and corn tortillas.  My gentleman ordered a Torta and three taco&#39;s.   We were served chips and salsa.. OH FINALLY, homemade salsa! It was very tasty and worthwhile! Then we realized--45 minutes until the Walking Dead starts, and we are 30 minutes from home. Yikes--To go please?!  You know--Priorities? LOL

The server was super nice (yes we tipped, because we sat and had chips).  Out comes our order, and out we go.  Once home, I sat down with my wonderful chicken.  The beans and rice were quite a small portion. So was the salad. Perhaps because they half filled the little cubbyholes that were in the Styrofoam container only, and they were sort of small? Perhaps so?!  The chicken was tasty, but my highlight was the corn tortillas. (YUMM!!)

The gentleman got a HUGE torta. He said it was pretty good, and the taco&#39;s had great flavor, and really good homemade salsas.  Overall, it was good food.  But not overly fantastic. I will look to go back, when we can sit down and enjoy the ambiance of this dive location and try something else and update in the future."

Sadly carboncitos didn&#39;t hit the spot like the other place .. I had a smothered burrito an adobada taco and some chilles rellenos... I don&#39;t like to bad mouth a place over a couple of dishes so I plan to come back and maybe try something different out but so far it&#39;s not a great traditional Mexican restaurant

And in my mind chimichangas are not Mexican food and we find that often in Mexican restaurants. I&#39;m always so sad. But here, oh my god,it was delicious. They have huarches, tacos and nopales on the menu. It was absolutely fabulous. Dont let the outside fool you. It is a wonderful place. If you speak Spanish, it&#39;s a plus. But it&#39;s not a necessity. Great Spanish television and great Mexican music."

Seriously, everything we had was outstanding. The only reason it got 4 stars is the service was good but not excellent. We waited a short moment for refills and our servers spoke to us minimally.

They have quite a few mixed meat skillet meals that they serve up with tortillas as well as several types of tacos and entree platters. The taste is good and they provide four types of salsas for the meal. The platter size is large and the two times I have been here I have quite a bit to take home with me. The servers were friendly and attentive.

 We both ordered the pachuga berracha( pardon the spelling) with mushrooms added. The waitress nodded her head and said yes and then left. She never asked us if we wanted corn or flour tortilla&#39;s so we got her attention and told her corn.
 When our food got there the mushrooms were missing so we told the waitress.  It was at that point that we realized that she couldn&#39;t speak a lick of english. She got the boss who had just walked in minutes before to translate. Then when our food was brought back with the mushrooms I tried to get her attention for more water by raising my hand and saying miss but she turned quickly away and did not look in our direction for the next five minutes so i finally had to take my glass up to the counter and ask for a refill. 
 The food here has always been good  and I know it is a mexican establishment but how do you put a waitress on the floor that can&#39;t speak english."

My mom and I went together and were the only güeras eating there.  We got a few stares but the waitress was very nice and patient- the menu is pretty big, especially for your first time.  Great service- just enough but definitely not annoyingly-too-much.  I like that you can see the kitchen and watch the cooks make your dish while you wait.  I can&#39;t help but stare at the al pastor on the spit...  Makes my mouth water!"

The food got cold really fast and wasn&#39;t very good. The bathrooms were very dirty and the lighting in the overall restaurant was dark and danky. Service was terrible, the waitress barely knew English (luckily we know spanish) and claimed her manager wasn&#39;t there when we needed to discuss a problem. Also overpriced. According to the health department these guys don&#39;t wash their produce all so well which is why i got food poisioning :( they have multiple counts against them, i hope they close soon or learn how to run a business. Don&#39;t make the same mistake as me and listen to the good reviews on here unless you want your stomach turned inside out."

The spit-cooked Lamb with a little mystery involved in the preparation of it may invoke gastrointestinal terror in some but I am not to be counted among them.  But while the Lamb is a tasty animal, the poor Lamb also has serious competition. And in a war of deliciousness, Lamb stands little chance against Pig. 

Sadly, people don&#39;t eat a lot of Pork in the Middle East for various cultural reasons. But knowledge of how tasty Pork is has proven difficult to restrain. So at some point someone got smart, got the hell out of the Middle East and moved to Mexico, probably just so they could start cooking Pork in the same way that you cook Gyros. And that&#39;s when something magical happened all over again, and that something is called Al Pastor. 

I&#39;ve had a now months-long tradition of being hungover on Monday mornings due to various lifestyle choices that I won&#39;t go into right now. All I will say is that bad decisions are fun.  Just like Gyro meat cures what ails me at 2 AM on a Sunday morning, my new traditions have Al Pastor treating those same conditions on Monday mornings. 

So thank goodness some of the best Mexican restaurants in town are open for breakfast. And that&#39;s where Los Carboncitos came to my rescue. 

I had a wonderful Al Pastor plate, with a stack of corn tortillas. Their 4 complimentary salsas make quite the impression and are great to throw onto your entree, too. Although I will say that none of their salsas really stood out as my favorite, and I liked the tomatillo the least. 

This place is easy to miss and very nondescript from the outside, but the interior is warm and bright, and way more inviting than you might expect. The service was great. It&#39;s a little out of the way, but on this day it was well worth it."

What differs about this location is the offering of free tostada chips to sample the salsas.  I did notice that the salsas here were significantly more mild than their sister store at Pecos, though just as flavorful.  Also unique to this location is the availability of cerveza.  Que bueno!  I wonder if the availability of beer at this location says anything about the reported bureaucratic hurdles to obtain a liquor license in the City of Denver.  Maybe?

Awesome new discovery.  Holy moly, this place has some great mole!  The pastor is also some of the best in metro Denver."

That salsa that they give u with chips looked its been there days or like it was somebody else leftovers it looked dry and cracked from the top as if it was really old     Being Mexican I could say this is the worst place and worst food I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life I should of just stayed home and cooked something for myself I can&#39;t believe I payed for this the place was dirty too.

Admittedly i&#39;ve only tried a few Mexican food places in Aurora, mostly because the 1st few I tried were so disappointing, that I simply decided that GREAT Mexican food in Aurora would be unattainable. Well, enter Los Carboncitos to dispel my myth. Went here on a Friday evening. It&#39;s in somewhat of an older and run down strip mall on the southwest corner of 6th and Buckley a few doors down from a liquor store. I walk in, it is nicely decorated, plenty of seating. There is some Mexican music playing from the juke-box in the back. We pick our own table and sit down. Grab a few extra menus from a neighboring table, (our 4top had 2 menus and 2 silverware wraps). The menu is awesome, lots of selection from seafood to fajitas, tacos to tortas. Even a kids menu with all the faves, burgers, nuggets, etc. You are also presented with a dish of chips and a carousel of 4 of some of the the tastiest salsas I&#39;ve ever had!! For dinner My wife ordered a steak quesadilla, my daughter ordered a carne asada plate, I had the Torta Cubana, and the little one...well she just had nuggets AGAIN. Everything was well prepared and hot. The food is brought out AS IT&#39;s ready so not everyone get&#39;s their food at the exact same time. If you live in or happen to be in Aurora, you will definitely NOT regret stopping here for a great plate of Mexican food!"

With an open kitchen, open bar, fancy-tech jukebox, and television screens keeping fans up to date on futbol stats, Los Carboncitos is definitely a laid back environment for any group, even kids.  Although the corn tortillas are house-made, the tacos are not a star player.  I usually stop in for a smothered burrito ($5.75) which is made with 3 well-balanced layers of rice, meat, and refried beans.  Overall, the flavors are simple and tasty.  Every table is provided complimentary tortilla chips and a round of different salsas (e.g. chipotle, tomatillo).  FYI, only the first round of chips are free.  The menu is in English, with detailed photos, and the service is nice.  If you want some reliable, genuine Mexican food, Los Carboncitos is definitely a top pick."

After all, with constant commercials, the food has to be good/somewhat decent, right?
Wronggg!
We were able to easily locate Los Carboncitos but were unsure as to whether or not they were open as the restaurant was dimly lit. We decided to try the door anyways, and sure enough, it was open. There was a couple sitting in a dark corner and only two employees were around, one, the waitress, and the other, the cook.
We sat down and waited for about 5 minutes before she took our order (she was heavily engrossed in the novella playing on the TV). After scanning the menu I decided to go for some simple tacos. 
The food took about 15 minutes to come out (for a table of four) and we weren&#39;t even given any salsa until after we commented that we needed some.
The portions were very small, there was barely any meat in my tacos (and my husbands) - there was more tortilla than anything. 
The order of lengua was a bit dry and chewy. But frankly, I had no idea what it was because it most certainly did not look like any lengua I had ever tried. 
Perhaps it was an off day, but whatever the case, I most certainly will not be returning anytime soon."

It shows. The place is clean. It&#39;s organized. Minimal decor. But if you&#39;re here you&#39;re not here for that. You&#39;re here for the food. The quality is on par with a lot of other pho places in town. Pho 77 has the best value for your money. Anything and everything is reasonably priced...even underpriced.

This is the closet pho restaurant to my home, and I&#39;ve eaten here many times, as well as having some take-out to share at home with friends. The rolls are really good, and the pho broth has exactly the right flavor to it. Aside from actually glimpsing the beef bones used to make it through the kitchen, it doesn&#39;t have the tell tale oily residue that some cheaper pho places have.

The staff has always been very nice and polite, even when I have made a very large to-go order in the restaurant. I plan to keep eating here for as long as they are in business."

It&#39;s certainly not the best, but it&#39;ll do in a pinch. I will say that the crispy spring rolls are pretty darn good and I always start with those when I come here. The Pho itself doesn&#39;t quite have the depth of flavor that I usually seek out, but it&#39;s pretty satisfying. 

I&#39;ve recently stumbled across the combination rice plate and it&#39;s now my go to at Pho 77. Deliciously marinated beef, chicken, and shrimp served with rice and pickled veggies all topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg. It&#39;s more than enough food to leave you full and happy. I have a hard time choosing anything else when I&#39;m here. 

The staff, usually one waiter, is very attentive and always ready to refill your water glass or get you something else you may need. It&#39;s fairly close to my work so it&#39;s been an occasional lunch stop more than several times. 

Do yourself a favor and give them a try. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed."

So to this Pho 77 we went on Friday March 29th 2013 after work coz we want something near to our house.  Anyways, when we entered this establishment it was empty.  Is this a good sign?  We are seated promptly and given the menu by the lovely young lady.  If I am not mistaken, this establishment is run by a Vietnamese family-run aka Mom &amp; Pop etc etc.

Anyways from the Menu, its simple, basic.  For the Vietnamese Noodle Soup aka Pho, the prices for Small ($5.00), Medium ($5.50), Large ($6.50), while extra items are ($2.00) if you need Meat, Noodles, Tripe, Tendon, Skirt Flank or Meat Balls each in your Pho.  

Appetizers prices were ($3.49), while the Rice Plates are between ($7.49-$8.49) and the Noodle Bowls are between ($6.49-$9.49).

Since the weather is too hot for me, I opt for the dry noodles instead coz Hubs wanted to have my &#34;original&#34; dish...

Here were the items we ordered :

*  Goi cuon tom, thit bo Shrimp and Beef Spring Rolls ($3.49)
*  Com suon bo nuong Korean Barbecue Beef Served With Steamed Rice and Vegetables Garnishes ($8.49)  (Hubs order)
*  Bun tom nurong - Grilled Shrimp ($8.49)

Service was prompt and pleasant.  Food Portion was a &#34;little-off&#34; to my liking.

All the food was SEMI-OK.  Nothing stellar, Nothing WOW to rave about let alone nothing stood out.  Decent Dinner, though I so wish if they could have put more grilled shrimp in my Main Entrée.  They ONLY put like 5 pieces of Grilled Shrimp in the dish that I ordered.  My main entrée is loaded with White Rice Noodles, vegetables such as julienned carrots, raw bean sprouts which I found they put it at the bottom of the bowl, cilantro and some peanuts.  *SIGH*  

Hubs order was A-OK, though I think Hubs prefer to have those Korean BBQ Beef aka &#34;GALBI&#34; in a Korean establishment, NOT in a Vietnamese establishment. 

Might return when needed or try some other stuffs in the menu but definitely NOT in a hurry.

Then another placed opened and they moved to the third position. What I love about this place is its location, I have however more recently started to not appreciate it&#39;s decline in service and food quality. I&#39;m not sure if the cook has changed, or what the deal is, but I ate there yesterday and literally had to add salt to my broth.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had to use much more than the veggie plate, hoisin, and siracha. Sometimes spring rolls are off as well. Lettuce taste like it was frozen by accident and then still served. Meat taste almost like it&#39;s been freezer dried. If I&#39;m hungry for pho and need something conveniently located close by, and quick I go here. If time or travel is not an issue I go to PHO 888 on 4th and Sable the best at the moment, or Pho Duy II on 6th and peoria. Much better service and the quality of the food is consistent."

This is probably some of the best pho I&#39;ve had. The broth was flavorful, the beef was thick and abundant, and there was a perfect amount of noodles. I usually only get a small, and this is one of the cheapest places I&#39;ve gotten a bowl from (5 dollars). 
You&#39;re getting good quality food for an unbeatable price here!

The spring rolls weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but still pretty tasty. I wish the peanut sauce was of a thicker consistency, but again, not too many complaints there.

My mom always gets hot tea when we get pho and she really enjoyed the kind they serve here. She also said the her shrimp pho was one the best she has bad.

In terms of service, there&#39;s a young girl doing it all (on weekdays anyway, I&#39;m assuming there are more servers on weekends) she was nice enough and our orders are came out promptly and correct. 

This may just be my new pho joint!

Other than that, this place is good stuff.  Smells great when you walk in (that lovely broth, I tell ya).

Decor is typical of a Pho place in Denver. But that is not why you go. You go for the food and this place serves it up well. My only complaint is the fish sauce, it&#39;s just too sweet and has no kick. Change that and I would probably give it 5 stars."

Oh my goodness gracious is the pho good here at Pho 77.  I have had pho from many different places and this one is definitely on top.  I recently moved back from Florida and saw that the name of this place had changed and was under new management, but decided to try it anyway.  My husband and I had been eating pho in Florida for the past five years, and we exceptionally surprised at how much better the pho tastes in Colorado.  (I think it has something to do with Florida having the worst water supply in the nation.)  Anyway, the pho here was perfectly balanced.  I&#39;m the type who puts everything in my pho from the basil leaves to the bean sprouts to the lime.  My husband prefers his without any of that stuff.  I typically get the meatball and my husband gets the steak.  I saw another review that said the service was slow, but I have never had that problem and have been here many times.

vital-root-denver,Megan R.,lt7bNHl-TXziny4FETu8nA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,492,48,Hh3baHqHl7ceKND6uzRGfQ,4.0,2016-11-15,"Justin Cucci does it again! Vital Root is the latest to join the Root Down/Ophelia&#39;s/Linger fam, of which it fits right in. A hip restaurant boasting bright food and rad ambiance, this is the perfect place to bring friends from out of town or stop for a post yoga treat. I&#39;ve dined in and gotten delivery from Vital Root, and it&#39;s been consistently tasty. Let me break it down:

Concept - 5 stars
I adore the idea of &#34;fast slow food.&#34; As someone who&#39;s done a fair amount of work in the slow food world, I love the idea of making good quality, sustainable food more accessible in Denver.

Food + Drinks - 4 stars
Pretty good! The bowls can be a little too oily and salty for my taste, so I&#39;ll probably stick to salads from here on out. That said, their salads are bomb! I haven&#39;t been able to find coconut bacon since moving from LA last year, and I gotta say, I&#39;ve missed it. They serve their cocktails in cute little bottles that you can bring back to your table and pour into a glass. I have to try their happy hour, but $2 tacos + $5 wine sounds like a plan to me. 

Price - 3 stars
Although I do believe good food costs more, I also think $4 for a little bowl of chips or $16 for a vegetarian cobb salad is a bit steep. While you order at the counter and the restaurant may seem fast casual, don&#39;t expect to come here for dinner and drinks for less than $30-40 a head.

Service - 4 stars
Aside from one little slip up while dining in (the kitchen forgot about my friend&#39;s dish and then the server asked us if we were sure), service was friendly and quick overall.

Ambiance - 5 stars
As I mentioned, I&#39;ve gotten delivery from Vital Root and while it&#39;s tasty, it&#39;s just not the same. You&#39;re paying for vibes here--the outdoor plant wall and botanical prints make the space feel extra fresh."

The restaurant&#39;s decor is super cute. It reminds me of something you&#39;d see on Melrose Ave. in LA. The first cashier takes your drink order, and the second is for food. That was kind of strange, but whatever...must have something to do with the alcohol? We ordered the coconut dosa, pad Thai, Korean BBQ veggie wings, plantain kababs, &amp; the Mexican bowl. Everything was good, but the wings and bowl were especially tasty. I always appreciate when vegan restaurants don&#39;t overload on soy and tofu. I wish I had more time on this trip to try other items from the menu. If I ever do come back to Denver, I will definitely be coming back to Vital Root!"

Hot hot hot place! 

Love love love this place. 

I read about it in an article naming this as one of the must eats in Denver. It is not in downtown but rather it is in the northwest region. 

This place is so awesome. 

Upon walking in, you can order their fresh pressed juice or smoothies. I got the cashew nut milk. DELICIOUS 

Then you can order. I got the Pad Thai and the Bahn Mi TACOS.

The pad Thai had this red sauce that made everything so good. It brought out the flavors of everything and it was just amazing. They use this glass noodle simulator to japchae and it was so good. 

The Bahn Mi Tacos.... That tofu though! Just Flavors mixed together. The &#34;French fries&#34; were yucca and it was super good. 

If you drink water, you can choose from three different types. Chilled, ambient, sparkling. It comes from a tap similar to beer. Just not beer :) 

Service was on point. The overall feeling of this place was friendly and warm and cozy and outdoors and clean and just awesome."

No wait service, you order your food at one counter and drinks at another. The menu is amazing and inventive, with International inspiration drawn from Asia and South America. This isn&#39;t Native Foods Cafe, so expect to pay around $15 per dish. I believe everything here is gluten-free. 

The salad we ordered was amazing. Lots of flavor and packed with super foods like sunflower seeds. 
My menu choice, however left a lot to be desired. The coconut dosa filled with root vegetables looked and sounded a lot better than it was executed. The dosa (an Indian crepe, basically) was dry, almost like a chip. The root vegetables were half raw and hard in the center. Nothing worse than a rock hard sweet potato. It also could have used a lot more spices. I did enjoy the black beans mixed with the root vegetables. It was very filling, I just wish they would have roasted the vegetables until they were tender. 

If this wasn&#39;t vegan and gluten-free friendly, it would be 3 stars based on partially cooked potatoes. But I have to give props to Vital Root for promoting a healthy and cruelty-free lifestyle."

I&#39;m the guy that thinks the only thing not improved by bacon, is sleep and possibly (though not likely) water. I&#39;m the guy that says anything without meat is just an appetizer. I&#39;m the guy who has actual conversations about the weakest form of pork (It&#39;s ham, for the record). I shun Soyrizo, I turn away tofu, I scoff at seitan. 

I am also, however, incredibly excited to go try Vital Root again. I went with some friends - and it&#39;s wonderful. Super friendly and quick staff, a really awesome look &amp; vibe to the place. Loved the feel of being inside it, and just outside on the front patio. 

And, it turns out, I&#39;m the guy who loved the food. So many things sound really, really great on their menu. I took a chance on the Mexican Bowl which, while a little expensive for its size, was absolutely delicious. The soyrizo could have used a bit more seasoning, but overall it was just absolutely delicious. Filling, fresh, fast.

They made a most meaningful mollification of this manly meat-eater&#39;s meatless mockery - and did it with style.

Next time I want the coconut bacon because that sounds effing delicious."

We aren&#39;t all that familiar with the pay at the counter, sit and wait service set up, but it totally works. 

I can&#39;t even remember what we had now, sandwiches/burgers of some kind and an appy which were all great. Good drink menu, friendly staff and amazing location. Outside areas are really neat - the back area is dark but totally great for a date night, front exterior is a people watching haven and the inside&#39;s not so bad either. 

Try it all....no really, try it all."

I heard about Vital Root from the Vegan Meet Up group in Boulder (long time vegetarian) and every recommendation from this group is always a fun, tasty experience!!! We drove over 40 minutes to get there (they do not take reservations). Arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday night, figured out how to order and then when you enter the seating area there is no where to sit??? There are no employees or management to guide you or make you feel welcome. Some tables that would seat 4 or more only had one person, so I thought maybe you share tables? I have been to places like that before. I asked a staff member if we could get on a wait list for a table and he said &#34;we don&#39;t work that way.&#34; 

One table had a college student with an empty cup of coffee and books all over a table that could seat 4. As the night grew on there were groups of people with diner numbers just standing in the back and front of the restaurant. I had had it when there was a customer standing by the entrance door holding a baby that was unable to sit while no one on staff had the &#34;awareness&#34; to ask the very selfish young lady with the books to make room for other customers. I wonder if a manager was even in house that night? I collected boxes to go and told one of the staff there were tables being held up by people that should be ready to leave, she shyly said they can not ask people to leave. They could ask people to share the space though? My family runs a restaurant in Golden and to take customers money and tell them to fend for themselves is absurd. 

To say the least we ended up by the trash in front of the very cold window, sitting on an undesirable wire chair that cut into the back of our legs with just a few inches of ledge to line up our over priced order. I never did find out if you could order drinks? You need to get your own silverware and water, yet the prices are as high as Root Down and Leaf (which we love). This environment is Not Worth the Time or Money. I felt bad for other customers and was glad to get out of there."
vital-root-denver,J D.,A_XyZqeCKHvK8KY5Cxb66g,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,0,1012,Qw3J3npLNVYBnAXK5ouhZg,2.0,2016-11-16,"I love Root Down and Linger and love vegan food, too.  However, not sure I&#39;m making it back to Vital Root, unfortunately. 

 First, the good: the entire food menu is gluten free, most anything can be made vegan, and the food is beautifully presented. 

Now, two big gripes with this place that will likely keep me from returning:  first, like a lot of people have said, everything we ordered was too salty (and i like salt!). Some of the stuff was borderline inedible. Second, the prices were too high for what you get. I generally appreciate modest portion sizes, but the portion sizes here were too modest for what we paid, even compared to what I&#39;m used to having formerly lived in LA and SF. 

If the chef scaled back the salt on many of the dishes, I&#39;d probably return. If they scale back the salt AND drop the price a bit (even just dropping it a dollar or two on certain things), I&#39;d definitely return.  I&#39;ll watch the reviews to see what happens here."
vital-root-denver,Kenny N.,kNL4SpfIdMC8GywGayDEOw,"Denver, CO",0,1,1,215,17,-0U7LN4Gs5VGY-L4hNUeow,5.0,2016-06-26,"To my friend that reluctantly said &#34;I hate to sound presumptuous, but they really let the vegetables speak for themselves&#34; during his meal at Root Down, I found you a new place, their sister restaurant, Vital Root. 

It&#39;s a different type of Cucci restaurant with less collectible items, but the purposeful design to still there. Each section seems to offer something a little different. When you first walk in, you&#39;ll want past the beverage counter. There&#39;s someone prepping smoothies and offering samples (take one, do it). Further down the line, you&#39;ll see someone prepping food bowls and then taking orders. The food and shakes are colorful here as your eyes feast on what you might be drinking or eating.

We ordered the Charcoal Dosa, Korean Bowl, Indian Carrot Pudding, and Beet Ravioli (most photographed dish by local food publications). The carrot pudding came first. It tasted a bit like carrot cake, but more carrot-forward (you could taste the freshness of it). We both enjoyed the spices and all the textures - crunchy, crispy, creamy, and it was cooler in the middle.

Then the next three items came and we did our best to share. The dosa proved a great flavor vehicle as I cut and scooped all the veggies. You could really taste all the flavors. It was a delicious smash.

The beet ravioli came on a bed of zucchini noodles and tomatoes. To catch the cashew cream between the beets, try it the ravioli separate from the other veggies. The flavor is better expressed and captured. 

Finally was the korean bowl with yam noodles, I think crunchy mushrooms, nori cashews, soft-boiled egg and more. Mix up the bowl and dive in! It was very colorful and you could taste sweet, bitter, some spice and great textures. 

What makes Cucci restaurants stand out has always been the food. That even when presented with a dish abounding in ingredients, you could always catch individual flavors and experience different textures and sensations. It&#39;s a full experience.

So eat slow and savor the flavors

Other notes:
++ for the water options and pull handles. The sparkling water was great to have. The water can outside wasn&#39;t working.
There were a couple order mixups including a wrong dessert that came our way.
They ask if you have dietary restrictions before completing your order.
The glasses are substantial and the bowls appear a woven compostable. Very cool and shows thought was given to every decision made.
Unisex restrooms with excellent decor.
International ranging menu
Everyone was very friendly and professional
You do order at the counter, get a number and then your food is brought to you

Disclosure: I received a gift card from Edible Beats expressly so I could check out Vital Root"

It&#39;s everything I&#39;ve come to expect from Linger/Root Down/Ophelia&#39;s in that the food delivers flavor and quality-wise, and the space itself is modern, clean and quirky all at once.  What sets this place apart is the fast casual concept and I am LOVING that part of Vital Root.  Makes for the perfect quick and laid-back meal without having to sacrifice anything in the food department.  Also, love that there&#39;s not one, but two patio areas, perfect for summer weather.  My sister and I both ordered the stir fry and split an order of yucca fries and were blown away by all of it.  I will mention that it seemed a bit pricey, considering you order at a counter, but that&#39;s the only drawback I see so far."

We left bitter and disappointed.

It tasted disgusting from start to finish.   The price represents Denver to the finest.   Overpriced and underwhelming.

Beet juice, Mango lassi and almond milk were vile.

Kitchari was a joke and insult to Indian Kitchari.   Please keep in mind the voodoo vegan &#34;intrepretation&#34; is simply a cluster uck of crap in a bowl.   Dosa was ok.

Veggie burger was eh.   Risotto left us ready to leave.

Weird set up.   Order drinks on one side, food on the other.   Sit down and food delivered to you.

Staff were nice; but cannot cover up the beef I have with this experience.

My parents are Indian vegetarians, they walked out telling me to never take them to a vegan place ever again.   It was such a poor experience.   

Save yourself the bitter taste in your mouth and absurd price for fluff, go to Root or Linger instead.   This place needs a complete reset despite June 15th open.   It lacks the flavors to survive IMHO.

Will never go in its vicinity, it will only evoke nightmares."

I have to agree with what a few other people have said about the ordering process being weird, confusing, and nonsensical. You order everything from the counter but there are two different registers you have to go to: one for drinks and one for food. Also, the menu is complicated and yet you have to decide while in line at the counter with people impatiently waiting behind you, making for a stressful and chaotic situation. 

The one thing I really liked about this place is the decor. Very creative, especially with the living plant wall. I ordered the tofu banh mi and was really disappointed! I&#39;ve had so many better versions of a tofu banh mi in my life. It was really small, not very flavorful, and the bread got really soggy. The tofu needs to be better seasoned and not cut into huge fat chunks. Also, the sandwich could use some avocado or something else richer to tie it together. I was not a fan of the vegetable chips, either. Please give me an option for some fries or something! I was also disappointed at the exorbitant prices. This is a fast casual, counter service place and yet the prices rival many sit-down restaurants. All things considered, the mediocre food, the high prices, and the awkward ordering situation, I&#39;m in no hurry to go back. 

I&#39;m surprised how willing people seem to be to overlook all of the flaws about this restaurant."

I like pizza and beer as much as the next guy, but it has gotten pretty tired. This trendy vegetarian fast casual spot is exactly the thing Tennyson needed to add more variety. 

I had the SPORTea, a great infused iced tea. Jake had the Tempranillo (yay, liquor license!). We shared the devils on unicorns, a veggie spin on Root Down&#39;s devils on horseback. Jake had Pad Thai, which was tasty, though I always miss that fish saucy taste that veggie Pad Thai lacks.

I had the clear winner of the night: the sunflower seed &#34;risotto.&#34; A unique dish recommended by the cashier, it has an incredibly satisfying flavor that really does recall risotto, albeit with a lighter density and crunchy seeds.

Service of the dessert we&#39;d ordered was slow, so we were offered a scoop of the banana hemp ice cream, which was really great in my opinion. Jake didn&#39;t love the texture, which I would compare to a gelato.

Finally, we had the Indian carrot pudding. I&#39;ll be honest, it was not our cup of tea -- the flavor profile was too savory for us and it had a texture that felt... off. However, it was obvious this opinion wasn&#39;t shared by other tables around us.

When it was noticed we hadn&#39;t eaten it, the manager refused to charge us and asked directly for feedback on what we didn&#39;t like about it. Super classy. We offered that some sweetness would have made it more palatable; if you like more savory desserts, this might be right up your alley. 

Despite our take on the pudding, this was the best meal I&#39;ve had in a vegetarian restaurant and one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a fast casual setting. I&#39;ll definitely order the sunflower risotto, devils on unicorns, and banana ice cream again.

I&#39;ll be back a couple dozen times in the next year, no question. I want the risotto again."

We didn&#39;t try the drinks, but the selection looked good. Love being able to order anything from the menu and have it be vegetarian. The main detractor is the cost. For three entrees and one small plate it was $50, which is a steep price to pay for a casual lunch. The portions were a little small, especially given the price. The taste and quality were excellent, but still such high prices were hard to take. Wish that good, healthy vegetarian and vegan food weren&#39;t always so expensive.

It is an order at counter and get a number place but everyone is so nice and attentive that it might as well be table service. The space is huge. First of all slick. Front patio has bar seats facing tennyson and a round community table that is a piece of art. Inside another area with stools that face the street and great table area BUT wait the back patio is heaven. Big spot with plants everywhere...spices on the wall is like art. What happens in Winter I don&#39;t know. There is no meat here but I was in hog-tofu heaven. It was HH I had beet infused tequila cocktail..so good I had two..potent too. 3 tacos all great..my fav was the plantain taco. Also had dates.  Then had churros for dessert. Even the water available is hip...cold..room temp..and bubbly all from a fancy container. The music mix was crazy..Lou Reed then Dolly..then Aretha.....oh more please.

A bit odd for a place that&#39;s been open for only a few days. About 10 people came in the door at the same time and it was confusing where to order ... One a good note the place is beautiful and the menu looks really good!!

As a vegetarian it&#39;s so rare that I can go to a restaurant and get a delicious and filling meal (not just a salad or another dry veg burger). Thankfully my boyfriend, who is very not vegetarian, heard about this place and knew he had to take me. :) It&#39;s a fast casual style. You order at the counter, get your own water, utensils etc.

We sipped delicious cocktails that came pre-bottled on the half enclosed patio while we waited for our food. We started with the Devils on unicorns (?) and holy crap, omg it was so good!! The coconut flesh &#34;bacon&#34; had scarily convincing texture and the flavor was so much better than I expected! (I&#39;m not usually a big fan of faux meat.) I could&#39;ve eaten a full meal of them. The beet ravioli was also very tasty. The sunflower seed risotto blew my mind, though. It was perfectly seasoned and had a good balance of textures. My boyfriend got their veg burger and didn&#39;t even leave me a bite. Guess I have to come back and try it myself. I&#39;ve got my eyes on their cauliflower and broccoli &#34;wings&#34; for my next visit!"

The ordering at the counter concept was a little different, but it works especially when you have Eileen behind the counter giving you samples to try and sharing with you why she likes each one.   The ambiance is a really cool outdoor/indoor concept (none like it in Denver that I know of). 

My boyfriend had the cucumber gin speciality drink.  I am not a fan of gin, but this drink was so refreshing.  I had the cabernet and it was good also.  They also do a happy hour during the week where the speciality drinks are $5.  

Now to the food. Amazing!!   Even if you are not vegetarian there are very satisfying options on the menu.   We had the charred carrot hummus, Devils on Unicorns (yummy because the wraps are crispy and have a bacon flavor) and Sunflower Seed Risotto.  All were delicious!

I highly recommend this place for veggie lovers and those who are not."

I wanted to come to the opening last week but ended up at an animal rescue sanctuary #veganproblems  Totally on point with the food at Vital Root! We ordered almost all of small plates. (They were actually out of the kale wrapped mushroom spring rolls) but everything tasted so delicious! Excellent presentation and sauces were on point!  Great atmosphere, decor &amp; music too. 
The &#34;fast - slo&#34; concept is interesting. You order &amp; pay at the counter and sit and wait for food. Simple enough but then we wanted seconds &amp; thirds (dessert)... So we ended up having 3 transactions. No big deal but I tipped appropriately every time since the &#34;servers&#34; get paid only regular server wage &amp; still rely on tips to make a living. The cocktails were strong as hell! No complaints about that! Gin is obviously vegan &amp; I drink a lot of it! :) oh and the front door isn&#39;t really noticeable. It looks like a wall (I wasn&#39;t drunk/ stoned upon entering) It&#39;s to the left when looking at the building. Needless to say I&#39;ll be back next week!"

Food was good and ambience was excellent. One downfall was the pace of the meal. We spent a good chuck of change of 5 small plates, and instead of coming out in waves, they all came out at once about 30min later which screwed up the flow of the meal. I get this is a fast casual concept, but would love if there was a way around this.  With food this good, it&#39;s nice to enjoy in waves!"

It&#39;s simply a lovely, comfortable space, so well-thought-out, with attention to detail.  It&#39;s obvious someone put a lot of love and creativity into this restaurant.

I went with 2 others and we had an enjoyable time.  I had the beet ravioli, almost too pretty to eat but wonderfully balanced.  I love the &#34;dirt&#34; taste of beets but somebody managed to marinate the dirt right out of these.  I guess most folks would think that&#39;s a good thing haha.  I also had the chilled carrot-ginger soup, so bright and velvety smooth.  Others in the party had the vietnamese spring rolls, Devils on Unicorns, the &#34;wings&#34; and for dessert, we sampled a cacao chip cookie and some rice crispy treats.  Everything was beautifully plated.  This is the type of place where you want to savor and marvel at your food, not scarf it down and take a nap afterwards.  I was comfortably full but not stuffed.  The food is honest and felt more &#34;pure&#34;, if you will, compared to other vegan fast comfort food.  

As others have mentioned, the sparkling water on tap is a bonus.  Super neato idea.

I took a star off because I felt the ordering process was awkward; also, although I loved the food, I felt like it was just a little pricey.  Maybe that&#39;s not fair on my part, as Tennyson is hopping hot real estate right now and it probably cost an arm and leg just to get the place up and running.

I will definitely be going back very soon.  I want to see it at night, when I imagine the patios to be all sparkling and twinkly.

Bonus location:  just a couple doors down from the cat cafe!"

However, I am not a fan of the way you have to order drinks, then food like an assembly line, plus there is pressure to order quickly.  The prices are high for what you get on the plate.  As far as being vegan-friendly, that is definitely questionable.  I have been to Vital Root three times and pretty much have to order the same things (as a vegan) which I have to have modified to make vegan. They do not substitute, unless you are willing to pay even more.  There are better places nearby, especially for vegans."

Always excited to try new vegan restaurants. We showed up after 9 and they were happy to serve us even though they technically close at 9pm. Ordering is set up so that you order first then sit yourself and food is taken to you. We ordered our drinks first a vital mule and an organic cider. I&#39;m gluten free and vegan. The menu consisted of mostly vegetarian food. We ordered sweet potato fries and the broccoli wings. The &#34;wings&#34; were deep fried and very greasy, the slaw that it came with was flavorless and bland. The SP fries were good. The sauces were tasty. Ketchup, BBQ sauce and Ranch all vegan. I ordered the Indian Curry dish asking them to leave out the Ghee. The cashier and another gentleman had no idea that ghee was not vegan! That worried me. My friend ordered the pad Thai vegetarian style with egg. She liked her dish but was still hungry as the portion was very small. I thought the curry dish was strange and very salty. I sent it back and ordered the pad Thai vegan. Wow was it very oily! I ate it bc I was hungry but I felt sick the rest of the evening. I am a pretty health conscious vegan so I don&#39;t recommend this place if you don&#39;t want greasy salty food and small portions. Probably won&#39;t return here as I am concerned the staff doesn&#39;t truly understand which ingredients are vegan and didn&#39;t like the stomach ache I had afterward. I hope they improve the quality and competence of staff in the future."

I tried several dishes before writing this in the hopes that the food would get better over time. Alas, it got worse. The main problem is that the food tastes just ok overall. There&#39;s no standout dish. It&#39;s super to have a creative menu, but the taste has to be there. They also mess up basic things, like putting so much salt on the yucca fries that they are inedible. Many of the dishes are also far too greasy. For reference, me and mine have eaten: devils on unicorns, korean bbq veggie wings, raw beet ravioli, mexican bowl, club sandwich, banh mi tacos (and sandwich, I think, on the earlier menu), yuca fries, mocha churros."

The food options were all vegetarian or vegan, which was unique. However, I thought the portion sizes were small for the price. The service took a little longer than expected, and they messed up one of my friends orders so we were almost done eating when she got her food.

Difficult to get the attention of your server, which is never fun.  I tried the burrito with beef, which had very little flavor to it, and comes with nothing on the side to spice it up.  I had to dump a good amount of Tabasco on it to get it to taste like something.

One of the bartenders was proudly shouting obscenities in Spanish, I guess assuming that nobody in the place spoke the language.  I don&#39;t have a problem with cursing, but like, screaming it across the bar?  Ok...

They have plenty of local brews on tap, several tvs to cheer on your favorite teams, a couple pool tables to help entertain your group for the evening, and cost wise it really doesn&#39;t hurt your wallet.

I have always liked the idea of being a regular somewhere awesome with cheap food and good drinks, and I have to say this place definitely fits the bill (no pun intended).

The restaurant doesn&#39;t look like much. It&#39;s in a small corner of a shopping plaza on Quincy Ave behind Coloradoland Tire and Service. The inside is dark. The patio is small. However, this place was fairly busy for a Wednesday for a good reason. 

We started off with a half order of fried pickles and half order of fried mushrooms. Both were tasty, although the mushrooms were pretty messy. I ordered the patty melt and my friend ordered the burger. I didn&#39;t try the burger, but it looked good. The melt was great. I was so excited to see sweet potato tots on the menu and they were delicious as well. 

We came when they were doing a tap takeover by Eddyline Brewing, so the brewery owner came by and offered us free glasses if we bought a beer from them. I did a flight of their beers and they were all pretty good. 

The bill came by and the price was perfect. I was stuffed and could not be happier with what I spent. Solid food, solid drinks, solid value."

I arrived to find out it was Ladies Night and they had some pretty great deals along with 25 cent games of pool. All in it was a fantastic night. 

What stuck with me about this place was how utterly awesome the people that work there are. Aurelia, Nicole, Sally, and Chewy were all so incredibly friendly and welcoming and I felt really glad to have found a local watering hole where I can get great food, good company even when I do show up alone, can have fun, and have great service. The people make this place awesome.

Food wise they have a specialty chicken sandwich that&#39;s great, burritos are great, hamburgers are huge and delicious. Can&#39;t go wrong!"

First of all, the food was gross. I&#39;m pretty sure they use a canned cheese for their queso and the green chile had no flavor and was watery! The customer service at this place was horrible on top of everything. We were charged the wrong amount &amp; it was voided. We were told it would come off the account in 24 hrs by 2 different employees. Today is the 3rd day &amp; I called to find out what was going on and the manager said it takes 3-5 business days &amp; acted as if I was lying when I said I was given different info by his staff.

We stopped in after work for MNF were not disappointed. Surprisingly great food (everything is under $10 (try the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers), cheap drinks, and excellent service made for a great night! 

Our group was also fortunate enough to be the lucky winners of a drawing for a free Weber grill and bar tab! Unfortunately, we had already paid our tab so they gave it to the gentleman sitting next to us.

However... the absolute best part of the bar is the LOBSTER ZONE - a crane game where you catch live lobster to eat.

Small, comfy, clean bar, with a little bit of a divey feel. Tons of TV&#39;s everywhere, with all the bar food staples. Their hot tossed wings have a great kick, the cheese stuffed bacon wrapped jalapenos are perfection. Everything reasonably priced. They have upgraded their beers on tap with lots of craft choices too from the last time I was in 6 months ago, which is a plus in my book and we will be coming here more often."

Just had take out and was dissapointed again. I had the big dam burrito with chicken as I have had it for take out before and was impressed. Last time I had it the green chile was on the side as well as the sour cream, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. This time the sour cream was on the side and the rest was swimming in green chile.  The cheese was melted on top of the burrito so that was a plus. But for take out the sauce should always be on the side. Must be different cooks. One rocks at his job and the other sucks. Also the latino bar tender has no people skills. Rude everytime. This was my last straw with this place and for sure wont be returning. Nothing special here just your typical run of the mill bar food. Dont see how they have four stars."

They didn&#39;t ask for anything, or even say anything on Twitter, that&#39;s just how I heard about them, and figured I&#39;d give &#39;em a try.

It&#39;s a sneaky-large; it&#39;s tucked into a strip mall and is way bigger than it seems. Decorated just fine, a little kind of rugged modern, and then a bunch of mirrors that make it seem even larger/stranger.

It&#39;s got a 2nd level with some pool, plenty of seating, a nice horseshoe bar and plenty of TVs. There&#39;s a good amount of craft beer on tap, with your usual macros. The menu isn&#39;t huge, but it&#39;s got some great standard dive-bar staples with a few Mexican options as well. I went with an Odell&#39;s St. Lupulin, and a philly cheesesteak + bacon with fries. It was top notch all around. From clean tap lines, to well-seasoned fries, to nice crisp bacon tossed on top of a pretty decent cheesesteak -- I was very happy.

2 things stood out to me the most. First,  I felt their prices were super reasonable for food. Second, they got kind of busy after we showed up, and despite only having one bartender on, she worked her butt off and did a really good job getting to everyone.

Absolutely a place I&#39;ll be going back to! A nice surprise in the middle of a strip mall."

I can - and do - walk here in the span of about five minutes from home. They have a formidable fleet of TVs that are usually tuned to whatever Colorado sports team is in season and it&#39;s a solid pick to watch &#34;the game.&#34; They supplement the sports with pool tables, cheap/delicious food, and...a live lobster crane machine. It&#39;s about $5 per try and they&#39;ll cook the lobster right up for you. I confess that I&#39;ve never seen anybody attempt to snag a lobster in this thing, let alone win one, but it has always been there. Maybe just the weirdness of it attracts customers. Maybe some inebriated customers have dropped a couple hundred chasing the lobster dream.

Oooorr maybe the owner just likes having access to fresh lobsters.

Whatever the case, it&#39;s a fun spot and a solid pick if you&#39;re just looking for a place to relax awhile and knock a few back. The menu has mostly good picks (the sweet potato tots are high on my list as a side) with emphasis on standard bar foods. I feel like I once ate the fish tacos and was slightly disappointed, but I seem to feel that way about enough places that I can&#39;t quite be sure.

Definitely a no frills endeavor, so much better enjoyed with friends who dig a casual demi-dive."

It was empty (apparently it&#39;s not a big Mother&#39;s Day destination).  The bar is sprawling and you get a good view of several TV&#39;s tuned to various sports programming.  

I had regular vodka drinks, my husband beer.  We both had the fried tacos, which were quite tasty.  I ordered a bowl of green chili to round out my Mexican theme, and it was solid, but didn&#39;t blow me away.  My husband then ordered a large fried food platter (I&#39;m still not sure why!).  It was exactly what you&#39;d expect of bar food - fried and served with several sauces (none appeared to be house made).

Service is good, but also did not blow me away.  Just a solidly average joint, but a great place to grab a brew, watch sports, and eat cheap bar food."

The service was prompt and attentive, without being overbearing as can sometimes happen when places are less crowded (we were in for weekday lunch).

The prices are unbeatable. A new standard has been set for bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers, they are a MUST. Sweet potato tots included with the $5 cheeseburger, can&#39;t be beat.

This bar still has everything we all want in a sports bar though: lots of tvs, twenty different beers on tap, great tasting food at great prices; and the cherry on top, a friendly staff and owner that actually seems to care as much about your experience as they do your patronage. I highly recommend the Dam Grille.  We only enjoyed the green Chile chips and queso and some hot wings; but if the rest of the menu is as good as these two items, then this is a place I will be supporting for years."

This dive bar is located in a pretty quiet strip mall with many vacant spaces. The hot breaded wings were hot, spicy, crunchy and delicious. I&#39;ve never had wings like this, it was like regular hot wings that were breaded over the sauce then fried. 10 wings for only 6.50. A domestic beer was $3.00. The only negative to this place was they charged 50 cents for a side of BBQ sauce (don&#39;t ask why i wanted BBQ with my wings). I would come back just for the wings if I was in the area."

I dont drink so can&#39;t comment on the beer selection.   1/4 burger and fries for $5.   What annoyed me is they had the music full blast so really couldn&#39;t hold a conversation unless you scream like the idiots next to me are doing with cuss words coming out of their mouths every 5 seconds.    

Won&#39;t be coming back.  Usually go to LA fagota when I stop by mictocenter.   Will go their next time.



So maybe I was a little hard.   Food was descent think higher end mickey d hamburger.  Service was quick.  But the overall feeling of the place took the stars down."

Since I&#39;ve moved out of the area, I&#39;ve stopped in there once or twice a year and every time I go, I feel right at home. They always have the most incredible waitstaff - even if I don&#39;t know any of the new staff when I come in, I always leave feeling as if I do. They pour their drinks generously, which is always good. There&#39;s plenty of room for either privacy and chatting, or at the huge bar to meet and mingle with new people. 

They&#39;ve also got a late weekday happy hour (4-7) which is GREAT for any DTC young professional!

First of all, its located in a strip mall next to a run down microcenter and some gym I can&#39;t even remember the name of! It is owned by same people as JD&#39;s Bait Shop, and equally as fantastic dive.

A friend I used to work with lives in the neighborhood and loves the place. When we meet up, he always wants to go there. I look forward to it! 

There is no pretense here. But, you can be sure to catch any and all sporting events that are on the tele, seeing as they have numerous widescreen TVs lining both sides of the bar. Each is tuned in to a different game.

If you aren&#39;t interested in the games on TV, you can play your own game of pool. 

The food is your typical bar food, most of which has been deep fried to perfection. But, I go for the cheap drinks! They have a full bar with a staggering number of beers on tap (more than the usual dive).

The wait and bar staff are especially nice. I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

It&#39;s not all dive though, happy hours usually feature members of the well dressed DTC crowd, but you&#39;ll also see the concrete worker, mechanic or &#34;just plain Joe or Jane&#34; who are in for a bit of something after work. At night it gets a bit more of that neighborhood feel. I Haven&#39;t ever had any trouble with anyone there either, be it at my drunken worst or cold sober. Decent music; usually some 90s XM channel but they have a pretty deep jukebox that I&#39;ve never quite bothered to check out.
The food is pretty dam good too! My favorite item is the steak chimichanga. This thing is priced at around $7 and is FAR better than most similar items at real Mex restaurants costing twice as much and I&#39;m not even joking! Their green chili is awesome and is all over the chimi...it&#39;s pretty good on their big fat hot dogs too, throw on some cheese and onion...deliciousness! The bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers RULE!
Prices are pretty sweet too! Lunch or dinner for 2 plus a couple of beers, you leave full, happy and with money in your pocket...can&#39;t ask for much more than that!
It&#39;s never really struck me as the best place to pick up chicks, but it&#39;s also not a bad place to bring one if she&#39;s up to hang at this kind of place. 
Great place to watch some sports too, I&#39;ve watched a couple of Bronco games there and it was pretty cool. The crowd was pretty spirited but not to the point of being obnoxious, and the few people who did show up wearing the other teams&#39; gear were treated reasonably well. I did encounter a group of annoying Notre Dame fans there once...I mean, ALL Notre Dame fans are annoying by nature, but these people were burning a lot of calories in the act of being deliberately annoying! ND went on to lose, but we had long since departed, so we didn&#39;t get to see their shattered souls...
Even though I don&#39;t drink anymore, I still enjoy going there and go fairly regularly. Hell, I might even go there later today."

The wings were fiery and delicious. Philly sandwich was pretty good. The huge disappointment, however, came from the hog dog. Something was off, but we never brought it up with the waitress. Wish we had, since as soon as we got home, there was an &#34;uh oh&#34; moment. Needless to say, I won&#39;t be coming back any time soon. 
Bizarrely, only 1 item out of the 4 we ordered had a price on the bill that matched the price listed on the menu.
P.S. we called the restaurant from home to let them know that the beans/chili had gone bad. The person that answered the phone didn&#39;t seem to care since all she said was &#34;i&#39;ll look into it.&#34;
In short, avoid the hog dog at all costs!"

Under the same ownership as J.D.&#39;s Bait Shop on Arapahoe Road, TDG is a friendly environment boasting 10-12 plasma TV&#39;s for all of your game watching enjoyment.  We were here recently for Game II of the NLDS and it was great.

The staff is very friendly including Stacy and Daisy who are sure to take care of you whether your at the bar, playing on one of their two pool tables or out on the patio.  Although small, the patio is adequate for a group of twenty.

Food is top notch with sandwiches and burgers to fit any appetite.  My favorite is the Cherry Creek Sandwich, which is a combination of turkey and bacon with tomato and lettuce on a bun.  Fries are a great fit and food is always served quick.

I&#39;m giving it 3 stars, simply because I&#39;m not a huge fan of sports bars, but it is a really cool place. The bar inside is fairly small, but plasma TV&#39;s litter the upper portion of the bar, and pool tables and a couple arcade games are in the other part of the bar. 

I mainly go to The Dam Grille to chill with friends, and as I said, because it&#39;s very close to me. Their food is pretty good, from what I&#39;ve had, a tad bit overpriced, but still good. Their hot wings are EXCELLENT, you absolutely have to try them!  I love hanging out on the patio most, it&#39;s small, but is heated in the winter, which is great for smokers! Did I mention the hot wings?  They have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ordered much of any mixed drinks there, but I&#39;m sure they can do those too. Goes good with hot wings. The crowd is a little older (sorry, no offense meant to anyone), and on the weekends you&#39;re sure to see some yo-yo-homies and drunk guys that will probably hit on you. All in all, if you enjoy some football or basketball and beer, this is a pretty cool place to check out.

It&#39;s a great place to linger and work over a charcuterie board, or to buy incredible cheeses and house made chocolates. The staff is really welcoming and they totally know their cheeses.

I had a cheeseboard for lunch (duh), $15 for 3 cheeses (choose your own or let them decide) and a really pretty assortment of garnishes and condiments. Pineapple mostarda, pickled green beans, Marcona almonds in olive oil, citrus soaked pears, roasted chestnuts.. Everything is extremely colorful and fresh and soooo good. 

They also have a simple menu of sandwiches, soups, salads, and a few cheesy options like macaroni and fondue. And you can get a great glass of wine for around $7-$10.

The owners were helpful and pleasant and offered us lots of information about the meal ingredients - much of which were locally sourced - which I like. Why not 5 stars?

We went for dinner and just weren&#39;t impressed with the food, though I will say customers around us who got cheese plates raved about them. 

We each ordered a different grilled cheese and my husband got french onion soup. It&#39;s really important to note that my grilled cheese came with a salad topped with walnuts, which wasn&#39;t mentioned in the description or by the waitress. No salad for me!

The cheese was amazing and gooey, but unfortunately instead of buttering the bread to get a crispy fried texture, they toast it. So you basically have two giant croutons filled with cheese (or mac and cheese), this basically ruined it for me. I&#39;ve never experienced a grilled cheese like this at such a recommended place, I really don&#39;t understand why they are going out of their way to ruin grilled cheese.

We also decided to share the triple truffle pie, it was delicious, but not worth the $10 menu price as it was a mini pie, so smaller than a slice of pie. This place is confusing, in that desserts are more expensive than entrees. I think dessert prices need to be lowered so they&#39;re more in line with the food being served. We found out when checking out that the desserts are part of a separate place. Odd.

Conclusions: Skip the grilled cheese, it&#39;s not worth it; but if you want to drink wine and share a cheese platter this is the place for you."

The employees who work there are friendly and knowledgeable, but the best is when the owner is there.  She clearly has a passion for cheese, and loves being able to help customers pick out something they will enjoy.

New World Cheese also has a cheese-based menu that you can enjoy if you choose to dine in.  I recently had their grilled cheese specialty of the week, which was melted to perfection.  The side salad we got as well had great dressing on it.  It&#39;s currently a bit hard for them to manage having someone who is serving dine-in customers, as well as managing customers who are in to grab some cheese from the display cases.  When they fix that kink, this will be as lovely a place to eat as it is to buy cheese from."

I have to recommend this place for multiple reasons. It&#39;s  clearly privately owned and operated, and from the moment you set foot in the door it exudes the qualities that local Coloradans have come to love and to a certain extent expect out of a new neighbor. 

The people running the place when I went in, would be my guess was the primary owner/operators were more than accommodating with my date and I&#39;s questions. They spoke with a passion that would rival only one describing a fine wine - on that note,  I was thrilled to hear they are pending their liquor license!  Bottom line - they knew what they were talking about, and they liked talking about it. 

The pricing was fair, and in my opinion hit the target audience right on the bull&#39;s eye. 

They just opened so its still a little bare bones inside, but the promise is there.

The salami, prosciutto, and blue cheese I took home was absolutely some of the best I have had in the state.

While cheese is great, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily think of going to a cheese shop for a meal, which is why I was glad they have a good assortment of hot and cold sandwiches made from their cheeses and cured meats.

Great sandwich, and the owner/staff are very enthusiastic and friendly, and eager to answer any questions you have about any of their products.  Highly recommend trying this place out.  The prices for most of the cheeses and other products seem very reasonable. 

We&#39;ve been back several times and loved each visit. Side arugula salad option is great, and the mac n cheese is great for kids. Also the grilled cheese and &#34;oh no you didn&#39;t&#34; sandwiches are great (bread from Denver Bread Co - yum!)"

Before entering there was a sign on the door that said &#34;kitchen will be closed later for private party.&#34;  As the door was unlocked and no patrons inside, I walked in and asked if they would be able to serve myself and my friend (cheese board and wine), they said yes.  We sat down and ordered right away, received the cheese board and one drink (we ordered two)... and never saw someone again for the next 30+ minutes.  After we mostly ate our cheese (the one cheese I didn&#39;t select was not good), after our water glasses had been bone dry for 20 minutes, after we had to go behind the desk to get utensils, and after my friend never received her drink, we finally had our server come back and apologize that she forgot the drink.  Since we were completely done, we decided to pay and leave.  Our server rang us up at full price in spite of the obviously terrible service that was acknowledged, and we said to each other we&#39;d never be back even though we both live within one mile.  I understand that mistakes happen and that they were preparing for a party later, but I believe that issues like this are what separate the truly great places to the places that are only good when it&#39;s convenient.  They could have said &#34;no, we will be too busy to serve you, please come back another time!&#34; even though no one else came the entire time we were there OR they could have done something to make up for the awful service."

Colfax, met your cheesy new neighbor!  I stumbled upon the two-week-old New World Cheese shop while walking between a bookworm session at Tattered Cover and a much-needed burrito bowl from Chipotle.  &#34;Woah, what&#39;s this cute little store?&#34; I thought, drawn in by the cute decor and the intrigue of a storefront that was not Red Mango.  Jackpot!  Teresa--who personally introduced herself to this befuddled store stumbler--has created an beautiful, intimidate space to sell and serve a wildly creative menu of cheese-based treats.  I can barely tell pecorino from asiago, but one doesn&#39;t need to be an expert to know that &#34;Ugly Goat Goats&#39; Milk Fudge&#34; and &#34;Gouda Waffle&#34; are going to be delicious additions to the Congress Park neighborhood.  Most excitingly, New World Cheese (let&#39;s just go ahead and make NWC a thing, mmmmkay?) will be hosting a Chocolate Lab pop-up shop once a month.  It can&#39;t possibly get any better than this!

I stopped in for lunch and savored a quarter Turkey Muffaletta with salad bar (it was just me and the whole sandwich is HUGE).  It was delicious!  A couple weeks later I was in the area again and bought a whole Turkey Muffaletta to take home and share with The Hubs.  Again, delicious!  Pricing for the quarter sandwich ($7.49) isn&#39;t very cost-effective compared with the whole sandwich ($14.99), so I think I&#39;ll stick with buying the whole sandwich and take leftovers home.

FYI, both times I was here the restaurant was very clean and the staff friendly.  Curiously it wasn&#39;t busy either time I was here (the location I used to go to in TX was ALWAYS mobbed)."

I got the &#34;beefeater&#34;, their version of the French dip sandwich. The bread was very good, not too chewy and overall tasty. 

My partner got the unlimited salad bar, which was nice as it also had cottage cheese, potato salad, and pudding.

Free unlimited ice cream with every meal is a bonus.

We went during the week and later at night, so the salad bar ingredients weren&#39;t exactly the freshest, but nothing was bad. It was pretty quiet when we were there.

Service was slow, especially with the low number of customers present. By the time my sandwich got to me it had started to cool.

Overall four stars. I will go again during a busier time and see if the negatives are still present, if so I will have to adjust my review as necessary."

Super small portion for $6.00 nothing else served with it.

Thought i would give this restaurant a second try after last week getting our food delivered to the table with most of the included items missing, they forgot the included fruit, no garnishes, and a horribly shriveled up hot dog that i took back up to the counter. They made an excuse that there were new people on the cook line.  If that is really the truth  (which i doubt because so many servers use that one for an excuse) then the restaurant manager should oversee all food going out to the tables until the line cooks are ready to plate food on their own, server should have also double checked before getting to the table.

I have to say, I was really impressed. Not only was the sandwich delicious, it was totally stacked! It&#39;s one of the thicker sandwiches I&#39;ve seen, which was great because for the same price I get the bare minimum at other places.

So we had never been to a Jason&#39;s deli before and I was thinking it was going to be a small hole in the wall sand which shop, this has got to be the biggest deli I have ever been to.
There is plenty of seating indoors and some outside. If you like salad bars they have one here it looks very fresh and clean.
They have about 10 different soups, the Irish potato looked good Ness really liked it and got bacon and cheese add to the top, and Texas chili is very good really meaty and a lot of chili powder. 
Ness got a ranchero wrap and I got a pastrami and ham on wheat with swiss, so good the pastrami tasted really good!
I just found my favorite deli here! And you can treat yourself to some free frozen yogurt."

Not only are they very professional and respectful to their customers, they have an amazing salad bar, they deliver, and they have as much free ice cream as you&#39;d like. 

Every single time I&#39;ve gone there I&#39;ve had a great experience. I usually end up ordering online and going to pick up my order. They&#39;ve always been timely and offered free ice cream and tacked on some free cookies for waiting. 

As far as delivery goes, I had one disappointing experience with the delivery boy. He ended up being pretty rude and I called to complain to the manager. Not only was my meal compensated, but he gave me another free meal for the future. The manager was professional and took note of everything I said. I couldn&#39;t ask for more.

Perfect, maybe someone was having a bad night. I get it. So this evening we thought we would try them.again... ordering a California club no tomato. This is the only thing I have ever ordered here. The sandwich came out quickly and it has tomato on it. I go to the counter and tell them I ordered the sandwich without tomato. A few seconds later here comes the same sandwich without the tomato. They literally just took the tomato off and brought it right back to me. I could have done that. So I go back to the counter and speak to the manager on duty, who is probably 13. I told him what happened and asked for a refund. He brings me the refund and a sandwich with no tomato. Yeah NO THANKS! Unfortunately,  this will be the last time I come here."

I recommend the wild salmon sandwich."
jasons-deli-aurora-4,Robin W.,T-1pnnqjz4af2pxjFmI_TA,"Aurora, CO",0,1,0,4,81,Rlj4mcmD5FksKUbR0BCzGA,4.0,2008-08-16,"I always research a restaurant&#39;s nutritional information online before I go to it so I have an idea of what is healthy and what is not.  One of the things I like about Jason&#39;s Deli is that they are upfront with the nutritional information.  It is right there on the menu, so you can make educated food choices at the restaurant instead of trying to guess about what you are putting into your body.  

   I tend to eat the same things over and over again.  I love Broccoli Cheese soup.  Usually, I order at least a cup when I go to Jason&#39;s because I really like their broc and cheese.  I also usually have the Spinach Veggie Wrap with fruit on the side.  Safe choices that I have been happy with in the past.   

  However the last couple of visits I have gone out on a limb and tried something different.  Woohoo!  This is not easy to do at a lot of restaurants that have limited meatless selections, but Jason&#39;s deli has a lot of good vegetarian offerings.  I recently tried the Vegetarian Fresco Garden Pasta and the last visit I tried the Ciabatta &#39;Bello.  

   Service was a little slow on both occasions and they do have a help wanted sign up so I am cutting them a little slack.  Jason&#39;s is basically a cafeteria line when you really think about it.  

  On the prior visit, the order taker mixed up my order and the pasta dish was definitely not what I ordered.  The manager took care of it right away and I received the correct dish in a reasonable amount of time.

  I love pasta, portabello mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and asiago cheese so I was pretty sure I would like this entree.  I liked this dish a lot.  The bowtie pasta was a nice change of texture.  The sauce and artichokes added a piquant flavor to it.  I would eat it again.  

  On the last visit I had the Ciabbata &#39;Bello.  Portabello mushrooms and roasted tomatoes again, but this time with swiss cheese, guacamole, red onions, and  field greens.  All stuff I like to eat.  The portabello mushroom cap was marinated, the roasted tomatoes were almost like a very thick salsa, and the guacamole was homemade (or at least made at the restaurant. :)  Overall, I liked the sandwich flavor combinations.  The only drawback was the whole wheat ciabbatta that it was served on.  The ciabbatta was a little dry.  I like my bread to have a just baked moistness to it that was missing here.  Whole wheat bread frequently falls a little short of ideal, but it is a trade off that I am willing to make most of the time unless there is a good sourdough on offer.

   Jason&#39;s Deli also offers Boylan&#39;s bottled sodas.  I never drink soda, except when I see Boylan&#39;s Ginger Ale.  It is my one soda vice, but it is worth it.  So for that alone I have to give them a thumbs up."

Jason&#39;s Deli does things right.  Jason&#39;s has made a concerted effort to eliminate trasnsfats and now has taken aim at high fructose corn syrup. Good on them!  I guess it also helps that they have complementary soft serve frozen yogurt!

On this visit I went with the Reuben, a bowl of Chicken Pot Pie Soup, and a Abita Root Beer.  The corn beef was lean, the kraut abundant, and the 1000 island was rich&#39;n creamy.  It&#39;s not Manny&#39;s (Chicago Deli) good, but Jason&#39;s definitely holds their own.  The Chicken Pot Pie soup was a bit on the not hot side, but tasty nonetheless.   They have recently switched to Abita Root Beer because they use natural cane sugar.  I&#39;m a bit of a root beer snob and thought it was solid.  To end the meal I helped myself to a swirl cone!

The space is clean and the service is friendly.

It was quick and fairly healthy and affordable and the portions were decent.  Now it&#39;s just meh.

Nope, don&#39;t care.
And figure this... when someone walks back up to the counter with their plate, they probably have an issue.  This is not the time to get snarky.  No, ONE measly half rotten strawberry and ONE measly slice of rock hard cantelope is not acceptable as the side of fruit with my son&#39;s meal.  Yes young lady, they did used to put about a cup of sliced fruit on the plate and yes it also came with a yummy yogurt dip.  No, you&#39;re wrong, they did have it in the past.  
After being dissed by the pimply girl with the attitude I went to the salad bar and got my son a bowl of fresh mixed fruit mixed with GASP, the yummy yogurt dip.  They can bite me.
My sandwich was about half the size it used to be.  WTH?  The sprouts were old, the guac was non existent.  It just overall sucked."

Small, local, fresh menu, friendly but not chirpy service, waiter was knowledgeable on wine, and able to recommend one to our taste, very accommodating when we had to move our booking back a bit.

Even though we did have a reservation, we waited a short time for our table. The only issue is that given the size of the restaurant, there is no real waiting area, so people crowd the doorway. That is my ONLY negative. 

We love small plate dining, and ordered a bottle of wine and 5 appetizers between us. The carpaccio was delightful. Unusual in that it was layered over a type of potato salad, but delicious. The perfectly fatty pork belly was accompanied by a mini doughnut and coconut jam. Divine! The tater tots were a perfect crunchy and salty starch addition. The mussels were small, but wonderfully seasoned and had some end of season tomatoes in the sauce which lent a sweet deliciousness. Crisp and sweet crab cakes made us both very happy. 

The restaurant is small and noisy, which really appealed to us. The bustle adds to the appeal. We were fairly close to the tables around us, but able to have an intimate dinner despite that.

We walked in to a full restaurant for dinner without a reservation but found a great spot by the window facing the street. We were happy. 

This review is mainly for their food. It was so lackluster and so ordinary that I was honestly disappointed and felt bad for my friend. 

We ordered the Flank Steak and Poached Shrimp, Seared Ahi Tuna and Chocolate Beignet.  The poached shrimp was bland. Seared Ahi tuna has the same issue and was just sitting there looking so boring presentation wise. The beignets were weird in taste.

My boyfriend had the duck and my mom had the chicken. My mom loved the chicken and said she would come back to have that dish. Which is a huge deal. She&#39;s very picky. 

The staff was very accommodating and even gave me some nuts after discovering that I&#39;m gluten-free. That was nice of them.

We ordered a coffee press for the table which Rick mentioned you can get a discount if you bring your own (this may have been a joke but I am sure to try next time!). We ordered the fried green tomatoes, which I hate tomatoes, but somehow enjoyed them along with the tater tots which were melted cheese covered goodness!

--Not vegetarian friendly. My options tonight were a $15 salad or a $25 squash ravioli. Denver has such a vegetarian population, this seems crazy. 

--It&#39;s expensive with no options. See above. I was having a drink with friends and not ready to commit to either of the options above, but I was hungry. Throw me a crackers and hummus or...something?

--They don&#39;t really want to split checks. Have been there twice, asked up front both times, and got reluctant, welllll okay if you really want. Both times.

I think last night&#39;s dinner was the last straw for me and I don&#39;t plan on going back again, which makes me sad. 

Starting with the beet salad, it comes with a rhubarb purěe that is so sugary sweet that it kills the natural sweetness of the beets and makes the whole thing taste like a bland, jelly salad. No texture at all and no acid or seasoning to offset the sugary base. 

The chicken scallopini with dill crème included a few tiny peices of chicken and the crème had no flavor and was like a pool of oily heavy cream at the bottom of the dish. At no time did I taste dill or any other seasoning. Underneath were some undercooked (and I eat like a rabbit and love fresh, crunchy vegetables) wax beans that couldn&#39;t even be cut with the knife provided. There was also something overly sweet at the bottom too so basically it was a mix of raw yellow beans floating in a pool of yellowish, sweet but flavorless cream. When I think of it now it turns my stomach.

My husband liked his burger but admits that it wasn&#39;t worth $24. I tried one of his potatoes that looked delicious and they had sugar on them too! WTH is with all of the sugar? Honestly, I miss the salty days.

I&#39;ve always had great service at Table 6 and their wine list is one of the best. They are generous with the wine and have delicious bread. Last night, the bread was the only thing I enjoyed....besides the company of course."

First and foremost - the service was rad. Our server was awesome. You could tell that he truly loves what he does and believe in their menu and purpose. He gave us recommendations and was able to explain each dish with exquisite detail.

The food - for us the food was subpar. We just didn&#39;t love what we ordered. We both ordered recommendations from our server and neither of us were extremely satisfied. 

With this being said however, I believe we would both be willing to try Table 6 again. The biggest reason being that the menu is seasonal and it could potentially be better at a different time of year. I don&#39;t believe we should write them off entirely yet - it may be worth another try."

I ordered the chili (take them 3 days to make!) with potatoes, fried tortilla strips and an egg on top.  It was fantastic!  I came with family, and we love to share bites-- so I also tried the stuffed brioche French toast, and the Crawdad Benedict.  Both were yummy!  The service was top-notch, and you just can&#39;t beat French press coffee!  

I will definitely return next time I&#39;m in town!"

The tater tots and fried green tomatoes are more of a shared appetizer. The tater tots are probably the most crispy tots I&#39;ve ever had. They were delicious and they&#39;re paired with fontina cheese. To not start off brunch with something carby, crispy, and cheesy would be a mistake! The green tomatoes are crispy. You don&#39;t get a huge bite of acidity like some tomatos have. Even if you don&#39;t like tomatos, like myself, still try them.

The baked potato benedict is amazing! I&#39;m all about these French, Mexican fusion brunch foods now. Runny egg yolks and hollandaise sauce over a potato? Yes please!"

Service was painfully slow, with an 8:15 reservation we were finally sat thirty minutes later. It took another ten minutes to see a server and food another thirty. We were at an angle that we could watch the kitchen and they looked like they needed a fire lit underneath them, not much hustle, for any staff actually...And while we enjoyed the tuna, the steak, ordered at medium rare, was medium and only slightly warm, not too surprising as we watched it sit under the heat lamp for a good ten minutes. Our server was super sweet and understood that we had to wait a while but we were still disappointed, unfortunately we&#39;ll be taking them off our restaurant list..."

There is a cute little seating area outside which is great in the fall or spring. The food is fantastic. I had the tater tots &amp; Fried Green tomatoes as an appetizer followed by the Chicken torta. The tater tots were my favorite. The service is a bit slow because it is a small place that is always crowded so be patient.

Over server Evan was outstanding! He was very knowledgeable about the menu and did a PHENOMENAL job pairing a wine with my tri-tip steak. My wife had the duck which was unreal and he paired a great wine with that as well! The food was very good, decent portion size (about the same in comprising to most Denver trendy restaurants), and good combos of flavors.

I would have given it a 5-Star but we waited a really long time for our food. I think this was an isolated incident as we were stuck behind a 10-top in the same section. I noticed other tables getting their food quickly without issue. It wasn&#39;t a big deal for us as all the staff was very nice, made sure we were enjoying ourselves, and very conversational (which we enjoy). Definitely a place I&#39;d go back to."
table-6-denver,Carrie R.,ifMziFi40nsz4SDTmraOtw,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,14,141,_HBd_ufwJtKURuW5eQ6cHg,3.0,2015-09-28,"Finally grabbed a table here after living in this neighborhood for 2+ years, and had an overall positive experience. The three stars I give it are for the general food/menu and atmosphere. Table 6 feels very cozy and warm, the quintessential neighborhood fine-dine bistro, and almost all of the dishes on the menu appealed to me. The two stars I left off its score are for two things: Salt and service.

Reading through other Yelp reviews, I discovered I&#39;m not the only one who feels Table 6 uses a rather heavy hand when it comes to seasoning. Our appetizer of cured hamachi did not fall victim, but our entrees were both entirely over-salted (the mister had pork loin, I had duck confit). I should say that both dishes were very well-prepared and tasty--minus the salt. The duck was so tender and moist, and slid off the bone in a most satisfying way. But the flavor of the meat was totally overpowered by the salt (and this is coming from someone with a very pronounced salt tooth). 

We also felt the service was a little sluggish, considering how few tables the restaurant has. It probably took us 30 minutes from our last bites for the server to bring us our check, collect our payment and bring it back. I think our server had maybe 3 tables, plus there was plenty of other staff buzzing around. Not a huge deal, but worth noting.

Will we return? Not sure. As much as I wish I could eat delicious duck confit on a weekly basis, the idea of paying $25 for something that salty doesn&#39;t sit well with me. It&#39;s too bad, because if it weren&#39;t for that, there&#39;s no question we&#39;d be regulars."

The small things:
First, I called an hour before our reservation to see if we could bump up our time. While they said they could not guarantee us an early seat, they would try, and when we arrived 30 minutes early they had a table reserved for us. It was wonderful. Second, my waiter also pulled out my chair for me - I know it&#39;s a small gesture, but I thought it was classy and brilliant. Third, the staff seemed to work together. Several times our water was refilled by someone other than our waiter, or our food was delivered by a stranger. It made for a really smooth scene - one in which I was never thirsty.

The Food:
We ordered Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer. The beef itself was excellent, but paired with the horseradish and Arugula pesto, it was an amazing flavorful combo. I ordered the Pork Short Ribs for dinner. It was a very tender cut of meat with the perfect amount of crispy sear on the outside, and while I had never had &#34;Speatzle,&#34; this egg noodle, potato dish, was a delicious side for the ribs. The man got Duck Confit and...HOLY COW....that was divine! Beautifully cooked duck partnered with tangy watercress &amp; beets, and a kim chee crepe - I would have eaten A LOT more of his if he hadn&#39;t eaten it all in 3.5 minutes.

Basically, we had a wonderful meal, combined with a wonderful dining experience. I surely won&#39;t wait two years to return."

Luckily, I managed to get hold of the Private Dining Room, which is situated at the back of this establishment.  This recent visit was on SUNDAY BRUNCH January 18th 2015, Time : 10:30hrs.

From their Simple Menu which they change regularly, Table 6 offer variety for everyone at our table to enjoy.  From what I could recall my friends ordered these following items :

*  3 Orders of T6 Nutella French Toast, each was ($12.00)
*  2 Orders of Blackened Barrimundi, each was ($13.00)
*  Pulled Pork Red Chili ($14.00)
*  2 order of Fried Cheddar Biscuit, each was ($15.00)
*  Ham Sammy ($14.00)
*  Fries ($4.00)
*  2 orders of Beef Bacon Hash, each was ($14.00)

While in terms of Beverages, several of my friends opt to have Large Press Coffee, and several orders of Mimosa.

I had Coffee, Grapefruit Juice and the T6 Nutella French Toast ($12.00).  The T6 Nuttella French Toast comes with Candied Hazelnuts, Maple Syrup and Whip Cream ($12.00).  Overall it was 3.5 stars.  Brunch with tips and tax, if I am not mistaken was $20.

Thankfully everyone in our group enjoyed their Brunch.  With the Private Dining Room setting, we managed to have an enjoyable Brunch without the NOISY Setting outside from the MAIN CROWD.  Definitely MAKE A RESERVATION for the PRIVATE ROOM if you want and have a Party less than 12.   

Our lovely server, is indeed accommodating and he answers all our questions with regards to the Menu.  Throughout our Brunch, he makes sure our glass of water and Drinks are periodically filled.  Everyone enjoyed their Brunch at Table 6, and some of my friends, do not mind returning in the future.

I came here on a date and I thought it was perfect. I don&#39;t like stuffy places but appreciate great service and wonderful food. This place was definitely more on the trendy side where you could have a good conversation but it was loud enough that you didn&#39;t hear the table next to you. My initial impression was that the patio would lose some of the vibe so we opted to sit inside. 

As aforementioned, the service was impeccable, from the second we walked in until we left. I liked the wide array of menu options and seeing some I don&#39;t usually see - gazpacho and carpaccio come to mind - of which we ordered the latter. It was pretty fantastic. It&#39;s a really light dish but, in my opinion, the perfect appetizer for two. 

I walked in with the intention to order duck, which the waiter confirmed was his favorite, and I&#39;m so happy I went with my gut. The duck confit was all I expected it to be- juicy with great flavor and accompanying items that made the whole dish work very well. I appreciate well thought out dishes that can be executed like this. 

For dates and small groups, this is a great option for a Friday or Saturday night. For what you get from the ambiance to the service to the food, I think the prices are really fair."

We came here with an international food group last weekend. We were seated in a back room that was nice and intimate. 

I started with a black tea and was pleasantly surprised when it came out in a French press. Very nice start to the meal. I ordered the barramundi with Johnny cake and Choron sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The sauce was a perfect compliment. There were also shoestring potatoes which were good but a little cumbersome to eat and not really necessary for the dish. 

The hubs got a red chili pork that was very good. Most people on our end of the table thought his was the best by far. I preferred my dish though! We also tried a bite of the Nutella French toast. It was good but I couldn&#39;t have eaten more than a bite or two. I just am not a huge fan of breakfast that sweet but the rest of the table really enjoyed it.

I knew I was going to enjoy Table 6 after one look at the restaurants interior. Pretentiousness zero. No smoke, mirrors or walls hiding what goes on in the kitchen. This is as open as a kitchen gets folks. 

I wasted no time ordering the duck confit I had heard so very much about and was I ever blown away. Strawberries, balsamic vinegar and olive oil were the paint on top of the duck leg canvas. The meat had a wonderful sear on it and the strawberry and olive oil really cut through any gaminess. What really impressed me was how straightforward the dishes were. You can point out and name each component on the plate, yet together the taste soared above the mere sum of of the parts. If you are looking for emulsions, foams and wizardry out of the Alinea playbook, you need not apply. This is a &#34;keep it simple stupid&#34; kind of experience for all the right reasons.

The service was also top notch and the waiter seemed to know the menu as well as the chef and the wine list was admirable enough. The street parking can be hectic during busy times naturally, but it is not as if the restaurant can do much about being in a fun and vibrant neighborhood that people want to spend their time in, just be aware you may have to chase down a spot. 

Locals are crazy to not adore Table 6 and visitors really ought to try it as well."

Table 6 did not disappoint!!  I posted up to the Chef&#39;s Table overlooking the kitchen about 1 1/2 hours before close and expected an ordinary service. What I got was a great evening. Greeted and waited on by one of the chefs I was promptly walked though his favorite things. I went with everything he suggested.

We made a reso for 8 and were seated at 8:25, which is lame for a Tuesday night in Denver. We ordered a bottle of wine at the door and even that took 15 min. The cauliflower app with grapefruit was disjointed and the tater tots with curds were OK but not an attraction. I tried three main courses: brisket, lamb and salmon.

They overpowered my whole meal, and I felt bad sending it back, since I ordered it knowing full well that it had onions.

In fact in the past two restaurant weeks this has been the best. The sweet and savory pork belly appetizer was a table favorite. I had the tuna and it was very overcooked so it appeared grey. There was no pink left in it at all. I thought though they were donut holes and not really beignets they were quite delicious. Service is spot on and you couldn&#39;t ask for better. They will definitely see us again.

It was an absolutely amazing restaurant.  The menu does change daily and it really is unique.  We truly enjoyed the food and the service.  The server (Nicole) was great and really did a nice job to make the experience memorable.  The price was more than fair for what it was.

The restaurant is small, its great for couples, not necessarily for groups.  The vibe is great, as the kitchen can be seen from the main dining room.  If you&#39;re looking for a great, memorable experience with unique food, this is the place.  Note: there is free parking in back, you can make a reservation on OpenTable too."

Service was basically good although our waiter brought us the wrong dishes and was dumbfounded that neither was right and had to go back to the kitchen to check which was correct table (recall small restaurant??). Anyways no big deal just odd. When the right meals showed up the only real disappointment was my pork tenderloin was so overdone I could barely cut it. Certainly should have sent it back but was on a first date and didn&#39;t want to raise a fuss. I expected better.

None of us had ever been there, so we really didn&#39;t know what to expect. Although we didn&#39;t know what to expect, it FAR EXCEEDED our expectations! Our sever (I wish I could remember her name) was on point from the moment we walked in, to the moment we left. When my buddies and I are together, we have a tendency to be demanding and needy, but that didn&#39;t seem to bother her at all. She was a true professional. 

As far as the food goes, it was different, eclectic, savory, and most of all delicious. I had the green chili (one of my all time favorites) and was thrown back by the flavor, ingredients, and how it all came together. One of my buddies ordered the lamb, and it looked like that gave him two hot wings! Needless to say, that was the running joke for the rest of the day. He ended up going with the green chili as well and was 100% satisfied. 

I really thought the atmosphere was different, defintiley my style. Music in the background, not too loud (hip hop), and it played into the vibe of the restaurant perfectly. We are definitely going to make our rounds back to Table 6. It was a pretty solid experience..."

Let me start off by saying the food is really a special treat! Everything was so tasty.  We ordered two salads, a bowl of short rib chili, pork loin BLT and eggs with steak fries.  The salads were $10-$12 a little on the high side for me.  If it was a &#34;meal&#34; salad then okay lets go for it, but they were very nice side salads. Good, but eh $10 good?

The atmosphere is okay but the food  was horribly over seasoned and portions were tiny. We ordered the pig in brick and brussel sprouts appetizers, those were  (Unfortunately) the best part of the meal and the pig in brick was not all that good. Brussel Sprouts were excellent but that does not make up for the $25 entrees that were both over salted. I felt like we were eating a salt lick with a bit of meat flavor added in. 

This was where I chose to surprise my husband for our 10 year anniversary instead of a casual night at home. Sincerely the biggest disappointment in years! We did notify the server who grabbed our plates at the end of dinner of how salty the food was, she mentioned that we weren&#39;t the only table that complained of the salty lamb and instead of a manager or our actual server coming over to apologize, our server just brought the bill and quickly stated that they took off the cost of the brussel sprouts to make up for the salty meal. Not at all acceptable! If they wanted to really make up for something, they should have charged us for the delicious brussel sprout appetizer and taken off one or both of the entrees.

Our waitress sucked too, she came by a few times (after delivery of food each time) and just said, &#34;Delicious first bite?&#34; Each time, &#34;Delicious first bite?&#34; If you&#39;re reading this, you know who you are girl, I suggest you brush up on some questions for your vocabulary...

SERVICE
I have to start with the service, because of this lovely incident: once my friends and I were on our second bottle of wine, I started increasingly talking with my hands. And then BAM -- of course I knock over my glass of wine, right onto my cashmere sweater. Not a minute later, our server was wiping up the spill with napkins and another server was handing me a bottle of wine stain remover from Wine Enthusiast (which works like magic, btw!). Five minutes later, it&#39;s like nothing had happened at all. GOLD STARS ALL AROUND! Our server was also friendly, attentive, knowledgable about all the food and wine options, etc.

FOOD
Everything we had here was absolutely delicious, which makes me want to try all the things we didn&#39;t eat. Their menu changes every day though, so I&#39;m pretty sure that could get really expensive. Here&#39;s what we had:
+Tots -- definitely not your typical tater-tots. I have no idea how they make these, but it was like a fried mashed potato ball with melted cheese, ground meat, and spicy peppers on top.
+Brussel Sprouts -- good-sized pot of perfectly-made sprouts with delicious seasoning and cheese.
+Mussels -- some of the best mussels I&#39;ve tried in a long time.
+Mahi Mahi -- very well-prepared, and the curry is great (if you like curry).
+Brisket -- extremely tender (just fell apart at being touched) - YUM! Probably the best entree here if I had to pick.

WINE
There&#39;s some really great (and affordable) wine options here, and the servers are great at describing the wines so you can pick your flavor preference. We had 2 bottles of the Nebbiolo, which was different than anything we&#39;d had before and absolutely fantastic.

ATMOSPHERE
Nice and cozy, but not too crammed. Not too loud or too bright, making it a perfect spot to have a conversation with friends or to go on a nice date."

The positives: they sat us right when we arrived even though we were a good 10 minutes early, the tuna appetizer was really delish, and the waiter was friendly and attentive without inserting himself too much into the dining experience.

The negatives: every thing else we ate was EXTREMELY over salted and that is saying a lot considering my husband loves salty food. If he commented on the food being too salty then that is truly saying something. I had the short ribs/black pepper noodles and he had the royal red shrimp/hot ham. Both were pretty forgettable. 

This place used to have the most amazing food. We were left with... not a bad taste in our mouths, but rather a salty one. Most likely won&#39;t be back. Two stars for the service. 

(PS: although I cannot say definitively, the next day after eating at Table 6 I got extremely ill. Luckily, my husband had not tasted the short ribs and was fine. This meal was the only time my husband and I did not eat the same exact food both several days before and the day after Valentine&#39;s so I can only guess it was the short ribs that gave me food poisoning.)"

I&#39;m finding in Denver that a lot of the great food restaurants are not carrying a good quality wine list and more emphasis on the food which would be ok if we (older folks LOL) could bring in our own.

Maybe this is a trend because of the younger demographic is not that into fine wines.

Great bread and salted butter. Would be better if the bread was  hot.  No bar. Kind of loud. Most people dressed in jeans.

However, after an unexpected chat with a close old friend, my plans changed and lead me to find this magnificent gem of Denver that I&#39;ve dismissed biking past almost every. 

Walking from our cab through the snow into the restaurant felt more as if we were entering an enlarged dining room of a familiar place I&#39;d have never visited. There was a very comforting atmosphere, especially on a snowy February night. The host asked if we had reserved a table being that they were booked (there is a very small dining hall, but it&#39;s far from noisy and clustered). Once realizing they had a chefs bar, we were more then happy to sit and enjoy the show as opposed to being waited on at a table. This is the way to go here, I promise you that. 

After settling in our seats, we were instantly treated with a nice glass of champaign from the head chef who was honestly just a genuinely good dude. Seriously, through our whole experience it felt like we were guests in his kitchen, not just costumers in a restaurant (my absolute favorite thing about a great dining experience). Along with the wine, our chef also prepared the two of us small tastings of appetizers we hadn&#39;t even ordered, but somehow could tell were making our mouths water just from reading the description on the menu. Try the Tuna Poke and the Fried Brussel Sprouts. Trust me on those brussel sprouts, I think I remember even scooping up some sauce with a piece of bread before they stole the plate away from us. 

Time for the main course. It was such a treat watching the chefs at from the chef bar prepare all the dishes, especially after tasting what they were capable of from the appetizers. I absolutely had to go with the traditional nicoise seared tuna entre, complemented with house potatoes, pesto, olives, and a poached egg (pictured). Oh man... This was beyond excellent. The way the egg yolk binded with the pesto created an almost hollandaise feel to the dish. Easily one of the best dishes I&#39;ve indulged on in a long time. My friend had the ravioli, which words cannot describe. I apologize, but take my word for it. If you want the richest combination of flavors of cauliflower, smoked fish in cream cheese wrapped in dough over a puree of almost a gravy like texture, just do yourself a huge favor and order this plate. Only one of the three ravioli was able to be consumed due to it&#39;s immense amounts of flavor. The other two were brought home for future indulgence.

Now that the both of us were stuffed with amazing interpretations of lifelong favorite dishes, the time had come to finish our wine and return to the snowy night. Sure enough, our chef placed two fork and knives in front of us knowing how he had already made us saying &#34;I don&#39;t care if you can&#39;t find room for dessert, I&#39;m gonna give you more food...&#34;. As full as I already was, I could not resist. Beignets stuffed with dark chocolate. Yeah, I think I could make a little bit more room for that in my stomach. 

I know this review has been pretty long, so if you&#39;ve made it this far all I have to say is please go give this place a try for yourself. I love being a foodie when it comes to dining out because I get to rave about wonderful experiences and encourage friends and strangers to go have the same experience as I had tonight at Table 6. Oh yeah, and the main man behind our fantastic evening was named Brian. Please sit at the chef counter and have him join your table. Super rad dude. After dinner I went and finished recording some tracks, and made all of my band mates/ jealous that I had feasted and they had Snarfs. 

TL;DR: Denver is filled with amazing people, and through food you can enjoy some of the best times with them. Go give Table 6 a try."

Even though yelp, google, table 6 websites all state that they are open until 10:00. I was informed when I came in at 9:20 that they were closed at 9:00. 
You would think a place that is only open for 5 hours (or 4 if you get the hostess I did) would at least stay open close to the time posted on their sites. 
I tried to call before I came but got no answer, so I guess it&#39;s more my bad for even giving it a try after 9:00pm
Table six food is great and I will be back. I don&#39;t come there for the service anyways. It&#39;s just will be tough now because I work evenings and will never know what time they are open until."

I just returned from the most blissful meal. Not realizing, but also not surprised, that they have a seasonal menu - I was encountered with a whole new experience of rich dish after rich dish. 

Not being able to decide on an appetizer, which were probably just as good if not better than the entrees, we decided to order three different appetizers: Fried green tomatoes sprinkled with goat cheese and basil, sliders sandwiching a delectable cream cheese/shrimp spread, and a fried kale heart salad. All three were drool-inducing and now I will probably not dream about sugar plums but how I want to return to devour those fried green tomatoes, kale, shrimp sliders again. Yum."

The interior of the restaurant was extremely loud, as everyone was gathered around the bar watching a football game, so we opted to sit outside to hear ourselves think. After baking in the sun for 15 minutes, we managed to snatch a table with an umbrella overhead to earn some respite from the heat.

We started with the brussels sprouts, which was baked crispy on the outside and then coated with an aged, crumbled hard cheese and a sweet balsamic vinaigrette reduction. If you don&#39;t like brussels sprouts, I urge you to try this dish, for your opinion of this vegetable will most certainly change.

I had eggs and pork green chili with some tortilla strips as my main dish, while my friend ordered the eggs benedict. I thought my pork green chili was not bad, but I&#39;ve had far better green chili elsewhere. Being Table 6, where they source all of their ingredients locally, the sour cream that accompanied my green chili was from a local farm here in CO. Best sour cream I&#39;ve tasted. My friend really enjoyed his eggs benedict, so that was a plus.

I knocked off a star for the environment (not enough umbrellas and the very loud interior), along with the slow service, and another star was dinged for my main dish. But the brussels sprouts were outstanding, so +1."

Food was fresh and tasted good.  I&#39;m not a big dessert person, but my fave dishes of the night were the peach pie and mousse with cherries.  The tot app was also a standout.

The ravioli was different, with strong flavors of the veggies in the dish, with a thin tomato sauce - so not as heavy as others tend to prepare ravioli.  The fried chicken was crispy and airy with some light seasoning, but I could have used a little more flavor on mine.  

With all that, the Hubby and I might opt for more apps and desserts, with just one main next time. But there will probably be a next time."

You know very well that was The Bent Noodle, not The Bent Fork, so let&#39;s get it together already, people. Here&#39;s the scoop on this &#34;American Grill&#34; at Iliff/Peoria.

The Bent Fork is located in a charming, nay, cozy, little building - so cozy in fact that I often forget where the entrance is and spend several minutes going around and around like a fool until I find it. But whatever. Once I actually get inside I find it takes me a minute or two to peruse the cleverly-crafted menu and settle on my food choices. Something a bit unusual that I tried on my most recent trip was orbs of fried cauliflower in buffalo sauce with hunks of Gorgonzola. It was definitely different - and I don&#39;t mean that in an obviously-trying-too-hard-to-be-nice way either. Having said that though, I&#39;ve historically enjoyed the tangy tomato/fennel bisque too, especially when paired with their melt-tastic grilled four-cheese sandwich. On that note, the rich and savory cream of morel soup is also worthy of note for the fungophiles among you. Luckily it&#39;s also fairly light, because...

Yes, you guessed it - time for our main course, and there are some delectable doozies here. The lobster mac-n-cheese (in this case getting a little creative and substituting orecchiette pasta) is interesting in the sense that lobster bisque itself is actually used as the sauce to tie everything together. Despite wondering how on Earth that was going to end up tasting, I found myself to be pleasantly surprised on a recent visit. But gosh, there are all sorts of other temptations on the menu too, from Jamaican-style jerk pork chops, to a pot roast made with bison, to a salad with chicken, Brie and strawberries, to salmon-n-chips... and on Fridays and weekends (in the evening) they even offer prime rib! But lastly, I couldn&#39;t possibly forget to give a mention to their range of mmm-worthy desserts, like homemade cheesecake (I had pumpkin once) or even a bit of chocolate/caramel cake."

I got a half salad with salmon and a cup of soup.  When I picked it up the total was over $18 which I found very high for a half salad and cup of soup but thought I would give it a try.  The salad was bland with minimal toppings and the spinach didn&#39;t even cover the whole of the to-go box.  Also the &#34;cup of soup&#34; came in a plastic container that you use to put cream cheese or hummus in, very bizarre.   Overall both salmon and soup kinda bland.   Staff was friendly, will possibly be back to try the in-house service."

Had the &#34;Maryland style&#34; crab cakes which were anything close to a real Maryland crab cake since I&#39;ve lived and call the DMV home, for many, many years I know what a real crab cake tastes like.

The California club was pretty stacked and filling from what I was told. The cheese burgers took a long time that the manger came out to apologize and gave us a small discount. From what I was told the burger was delicious but the buffalo didn&#39;t stand out to make it unique. I had the Jamaican jerk pork chops which I had a small fear of it being too spicy but it wasn&#39;t. The pork chops were juicy with the mango chutney complimented the vegetables it was served with nicely. Remembering honestly makes my mouth water.

I ordered the Asian fried chicken (one of my favorites) and was extremely disappointed! Chicken was dry and did not have a pleasant taste!

The menu looks great--very diverse, a lot of choices and different dishes, with an American flair.

Based on a Yelper&#39;s review, I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. They were good--spicy, which I love, and really a large portion. I ended up giving the 3rd taco to my husband to finish. He had the buffalo beer cheese burger, which I took a bite of--it seemed fine. I didn&#39;t taste his fries but they looked like they might have been bagged? Bummer if so.

I had an excellent experience with dinner here around 5pm on a Friday with a group of three people total. Was able to try a starter salad, California Club sandwich, Bbq Pulled Pork sandwich with sweet potato fries, and brownie sampler and ice cream dessert. 

The starter salad included lots of cut-up fresh dark greens with a delicious and unique balsamic vinegar dressing. This was not some stupid/cheap salad. It was much better than what I&#39;m used to getting at other restaurants and it was very thoughtfully assembled. 

I ordered a California Club sandwich and a person I was with ordered a Bbq Pulled Pork sandwich with coleslaw and sweet potato fries. We each swapped half of our sandwiches and agreed that they were both really, really great.  

I was talked in to getting the Brownie Sampler dessert, which included two brownies and two scoops of ice cream. I love chocolate and rich desserts but typically don&#39;t go crazy for brownies. BUT YET AGAIN, I was completely impressed by the food that arrived. Not sure how to describe what made the dessert so good and different than other restaurants. It just tasted homemade to me or something. It was plenty for all three of us to share. 

I write Yelp reviews when I&#39;ve had a terrible experience or an outstanding one. This was an outstanding one. We received the best service, the ambience was good, the portions were very generous, and it all was just so delicious. Didn&#39;t taste like &#34;chain restaurant&#34; food at all. It felt like I was eating at a high-end restaurant but with fairly reasonable prices.

(Usually, it&#39;s not so on-point at other locations.) The restaurant&#39;s interior looked really nice and gave off a clean, relaxed vibe. Food was good. My salmon was seasoned and grilled. It didn&#39;t taste strongly of char like some other restaurants serving grilled salmon. Seasoning was really nice because I could still taste both the fish and seasoning.

From the outside, Bent Fork is unobtrusive, hidden in the parking lot of a strip mall, and from its placement, you&#39;d expect some sort of bland chain fare. Far from it! The menu is full of flavor combinations that aren&#39;t trying too hard but are happy in their elegance and simplicity. I was also a fan of the portion sizes; dinner for myself was just fine with an appetizer and a half salad. The steak and goat cheese bruschetta will absolutely be a table pleaser, and the salad was fresh with a nice tangy balsamic that complemented the strawberries and brie. Wine list is balanced with classic favorites but also a delightful list of &#34;eclectics&#34; for both whites and reds that are definitely worth a look - selfishly, I&#39;m thrilled to see more restaurants, Bent Fork among them, getting more interesting with their whites! The service at Bent Fork struck the perfect balance of attentiveness without being annoying; the room was quiet and I had the leisure to enjoy my solo meal and my book.

I tried the salmon blt (very good, the lemon aioli was great), grilled four cheese and tomato bisque (the tomato bisque was tasty and the grilled cheese was very good because it had gorgonzola and that cheese is the ), and the steak and goat cheese bruschetta, which was okay but could&#39;ve used a little something extra.

I was there on a Monday night and all seemed pretty peaceful.

The food was top notch. My boyfriend got a steak and blu cheese pasta that was creamy and flavorful. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos which were some of the best I&#39;ve had. It had a perfect mix of heat and flavor - just the thought of them is making my mouth water again. We had a fantastic meal and paid less than $50 for it AND we didn&#39;t have to drive into Denver to get it. 

Fantastic service, great atmosphere, and delicious food - this place is great!"

Really - the food could have made better at home or had much better in Granny&#39;s kitchen. The clientele were of the sort that they couldn&#39;t or can no longer cook.

Always taking an opportunity to invite someone who has never been. A had 15 team members were in town for meetings... I called the restaurant the same day to get us in for dinner. The wonderful people at Bent Fork put tables together for us, provided us exceptional service and we dined on tasty dinners and drinks. I love exposing out of town guests to a Colorado original and a place they all loved and said they will go to when they are back in town. We helped me to be a great Colorado company hostess! I absolutely love the steak bruschetta, ahi tuna salad, pork chops and the steak is always cooked to perfection. The hostess and wait staff are friendly, accommodating and prompt!

When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately. Our server, Rachel, was over at our table in an instant with a warm welcome and a sunny smile.  She was extremely patient with all of our questions and ready with suggestions that proved excellent. When my salad came out the dressing decided it wasn&#39;t staying on the plate and hopped on the table instead. Rachel handled the slight snafu so elegantly and was back with a new salad in seconds. 

My husband had the buffalo burger and I had the green chili mac and cheese. Both tasted heavenly and were cooked to perfection. As we were leaving we were thanked for our business and given a good night which is a refreshing change from some restaurants where staff can barely be bothered to acknowledge your presence. 

Overall, dining at the Bent Fork was an amazing experience. The customer service was superb and the food was delightful. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back."

From a food perspective, I don&#39;t think the kitchen has the technical skill to pull off what is otherwise a great looking menu.  The ambience was also nothing special.  Bent Fork is a quaint little restaurant and bar located in a strip mall off of Iliff in Aurora.  It was packed on Friday night and I am glad we had reservations or there was no chance of getting a table.  We started with a fantastic appetizer of steak bruchetta-style bread.  I highly recommend for sharing.

The entrees, however, were lacking.  We split the &#34;naked&#34; chicken and the California cobb salad.  The chicken was tough almost to the point of being inedible.  The sides were good with the scalloped potatoes being the signature of the dish.  My California cobb lacked any flavor whatsoever and the sweet potato fries were soggy.

For desert, the table shared the brownie sampler and creme brulee.  The brownies tasted like they were straight out of the microwave and from a box.  The ice cream had freezer burn.  The creme brulee was equally terrible.  It may have been 3/4 of an inch thick (being generous) and was overcooked."

We were seated quickly and our server was kind and courteous. It did take awhile to get the waters refilled and for the extra lemon for my water to come. We drink a lot of water though so maybe they are just used to people going through it more slowly. It seems odd to note this but we were seated in an area where the ceiling fans were running in front of the recessed lighting. It gave me a horrible headache like strobe lighting would. It&#39;s a weird design flaw on their part and something I definitely think should be corrected if they do any renovations. Our server was kind enough to reseat us at our request and we enjoyed the rest of the meal in a corner where the flashing wasn&#39;t as noticeable. Overall we enjoyed our meal, drinks, and service."

My father ordered the salmon and chips and the salmon was over cooked and tacky. My mother ordered the spicy sausage penne pasta and the sausage was very low quality. The dish is something any newbie cook could easily prepare at home for half the cost. I ordered the ahi salad and again, not impressed with the way the ahi was cooked. Not much flavor on the sear and low quality fish for $15. Not the worst I&#39;ve ever had, but close. Not very many options in aurora if you are with traditional American food diners, so it can be kind of tough. It&#39;s probably worth driving a little further to Lowry or Colorado blvd. for better options."

The building has a very modern feel to it including the dim lighting. The staff was very attentive. My dad dropped his knife on the floor and a staff member came by with a new napkin/silverware roll soon after.

For an appetizer, we had the steak and goat cheese bruschetta. It was very delicious. I&#39;m generally a filet mignon person and although the steak was not filet mignon, it was soooo tender and cooked properly. It came with a balsamic sauce on it as well that was good. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys steak.

For dinner I had the baby back ribs, fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw was a cross between the vinegar based and mayonnaise based types. It was really good. There were bell peppers and cranberries in it. The ribs were falling off the bone. I could pull on the rib and it would slide out cleanly. They weren&#39;t oversauced either. Extra sauce came in a cup on the side. They also put an extra bowl with napkins and wetnaps as well so I was highly impressed with their presentation.

The waitress we had was named Sonya and she was the sweetest waitress I think I&#39;ve ever had anywhere, bar none. She had a bubbly personality that made us feel very welcome."

Probably the best I&#39;ve every had in 60+ years. Thin, tasty beef, with lots of crispy sizzled edges and no fat. Cheese and grilled onions were slightly sweet and plentiful, but not smothering the beef. The soft, toasted bread held up perfectly for dipping. A big side order of their awesome sweet potato fries and I was in hog heaven! But, I saved room for desert and wasn&#39;t disappointed.  The raspberry bread pudding was equally fantastic."

My wife had the Anahi Fish Tacos which I took a bit to see. Both our food came out literally 6 minutes after ordering. Natalie was very hospitable and attentive.

We had the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant. When we arrived we were seated immediately by our waitress who was extremely pleasant. We ordered water and went on to peruse the menu after making our selections (salmon fish and chips/13.99 and the spicy pecan Gorgonzola salad/10.99) after ordering I asked for more water. It did not come until our meal came out 10-15 min later. 
     
The fish was hot and fresh tho the badder was greasy and off putting. The coleslaw was store bought with some green peppers added in, but the slaw was so runny it soaked all my fries (frozen). 

The salad was a small portion for $10. The dressing was really good but it was overdressed. Towards the bottom of my bowl it was more of a balsamic soup, so much so that It became unenjoyable. There were a good amount of pears on the salad and same with the almonds. They put a few mandarin oranges. Over all I&#39;d give the salad a 5/10 rating. I wouldn&#39;t pay for it again.

Service went down hill fast after being seated. The only time we were spoken to or serviced after takeing our orde was by the food runner who noticed we were out of water and said he would bring some and never did. However I must admit the table adjacent to us received excellent service the waitress was only AWAY from there table 2 times to seat other guests. 

Over all I regret to report we will not be returning to Bent Fork. :("

Let me put it this way....I asked the waiter to bring out the chef so I could smack him on the @ss.

The lobster mac is ridiculous....With a side of ridick.

Martinis....we had a few. My wife said the French was too sweet and then reversed her original opinion changing it to it was de-lish.

The wifey had the pork Dilla for an entree and said she wished MY special sauce tasted that way. 

The ribeye was a safe choice but cooked perfectly. The scallop potatoes were actually pretty dang good. 

Our server....waiting for him to come back so I can get his name...he just came back. It&#39;s Chad. He was exceptional. Great suggestions and timely. 

So deserts here....We got the pudding and the pumpkin cheesecake. My wife just made an &#34;O&#34; face so I&#39;m ending this here so I can get some before she finishes it off.

The sweet potato fries were clearly old and warmed up before brought to the table. The burger was ordered to be medium but showed up well done.

The owner visited with us, a chef came out also, and our waitperson was first class. The service could not have been better for our party of 5 including a restless 3 year old!

This is a hidden gem."

Service was mediocre for a slow night. We had to hunt down the waitress twice for beverage refills. The food was pretty average but tasty despite the overpricing. It&#39;s a nice one time visit but we won&#39;t be returning as we can get better service and food w/o over peppering elsewhere. The venue is great for larger groups. I think we just went on a off night for the establishment was all.

My husbands chicken was very dry whereas my burger, which was ordered medium well, was quite raw &amp; undercooked and took them 15 minutes to reheat/cook on a dead night. The consistency that night was just a little off.  My crème brûlée was under cooked and watery which was a bummer as that is my favorite desert. Everything else was over cooked, over spiced or too much dressing.

It looked nice and staff was pretty friendly. Just don&#39;t pop in an hour before closing as it will diminish your service and food quality. If you are looking for a menu that has mostly spiced hotter foods, you should try this place. But if you or your kids can not handle a little hot spice in everything, skip it."

He ordered the Lobster Mac N Cheese the portion was a child size and I ordered a medium Filet Mignon and it came out with just the steak (no sides) and was well done and was the worst steak I have ever had.

We started our experience with the Bent Fork by calling to check on menu options for my daughters various food allergies. The gentleman who answered the phone felt confident that they would have options for us, but he checked with the chef to be sure. After being on hold for just a moment, Chef Mike introduced himself and asked to clarify the allergies. My daughter is allergic to Gluten, Diary, soy, eggs, peanuts corn and almonds. He did say that those would limit the options but gave several things that he felt he could do, most of which were not even on their standard menu. 

We went ahead and made a reservation, feeling sure that we could have a safe meal. When we arrived the staff already had our table set and then went and told Chef Mike we were there. We notified our server of the various allergies and placed our order. A few moments later she returned and said that Chef was going to substitute one rice dish for another because of a contradiction. It was obvious he really had a handle on his food and what allergens to look out for. My daughter ended up ordering a plain grilled chicken breast with fruit and veg, I ordered the again fried chicken, my husband ordered the green chilli mac and cheese and the other members of our party order the lobster mac and ribs. Everything, including my daughters plain chicken breast was amazing. The flavors were present and bold yet not  at all overpowering. Not one of us had a single complaint about any of the dishes and we all cleaned our plates.

 It&#39;s difficult nowadays to find a restaurant that isn&#39;t a food mill of sorts, just worried about getting food out as fast as possible. To find a restaurant that also will work with my daughters various allergies, is almost unheard of. We could not be more pleased with our visit, and will be returning soon!"

We waited at the bar and had a drink, bartender didn&#39;t charge for soda which was nice. About 30 minutes later we were still waiting (and starving) and I went to ask the hostess the status. She told me patrons were &#34;camping&#34; and that it wasn&#39;t her &#34;job to kick people out&#34;. I&#39;m not sure why she was arguing with me, but she was young and I&#39;m wondering maybe new too. When we were finally seated there was a family of four who had gotten there after us seated first... IN THE BOOTH. We go two mismatched tables pushed next to each other. Seriously? Fortunately the waitress was fantastic (we gave her a heads up that we were ready to eat). Over 75% of their menu has meat on it, vegetarians don&#39;t only eat salad! Tried their buffalo cauliflower wings from the appetizer menu. Not many people know about the hidden delicious gem of fried cauliflower and these were delicious. Too bad it was only an appetizer size. The decor is nice and the food was decent, but the hostess could clearly use some guidance on hospitality and customer service. The manager on staff too for that matter, as he came to let us know our table would be ready soon, but still sat the other family first and made no attempt at amends - even a free chip and salsa or something inexpensive is a nice gesture and goes a long way!"

I arrived at Bubu shortly after opening to find the restaurant mostly empty. There was no line so I walked directly to the counter. I stood for a minute or two before being acknowledged; the gentleman working the register was obviously trying to get everything up and running for the day. It appeared as if 100+ online orders were already being prepared so I&#39;ll give him the benefit of the doubt for being a little slow to acknowledge me. 

I decided on a Thai Bowl with rice noodles and tofu, which was prepared and delivered to me almost as quickly as I could find a seat. Seeing as this was my first visit, I wasn&#39;t familiar with the procedure and I was left to my own devices to find silverware and napkins (to the right of the main counter, around the corner). 

The flavor of the bowl can be primarily attributed to the sauce. The thai dressing has an exciting flavor with a nice kick to it--I highly enjoyed it. The other ingredients in the bowl were good in both taste and quantity. I especially enjoyed the crispy shallots; they really made the dish &#39;pop&#39;. 

As mentioned by another Yelp review, the rice noodles were a tad hard, although not disgustingly so. The only part of the dish I found disappointing was the tofu. It was far too soft for my liking, almost possessing the texture of a soggy noodle. I would have enjoyed the dish much more (perhaps 5 star worthy) if the tofu had been fried or at least a little more firm. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant really shines. A mix of industrial exposed brick walls and ultra-modern dining furniture give the place a unique flare and make it fun to dine-in. A lot of the seating is counter-style and there are only 3 or 4 tables. Although the line was out the door, the dining area remained fairly quiet--most people seem to take their food to-go. If you&#39;re stopping in during your lunch break (either from school or work), the atmosphere is conducive to a nice break. It may be to your benefit to ditch the lunch- or break-room and eat here."

I love the concept of building your own meal (in this case, bowls) that combine what you like into one tasty dish. You start with a bowl, add a base (such as rice or noodles), and end with a protein. The ingredients are fresh and each bowl is made right as you order it. My favorite so far is the Colorado OG with chicken. I really enjoyed the different textures and complex flavors with enough of a serving size that I was delightfully full by the end. The house dressing definitely kicked it up a notch and tied all of the individual ingredients together! 

This location is open during lunch hours only, but is definitely a great stop for a quick lunch to take with you if need be. Prices are very affordable, with the most expensive bowl sitting at about $15. The staff is friendly and the space is modern; fitting for the concept!"

Pros: 
++ Located on the 16th Street mall so there are a lot of great options nearby if you are going with others who may not want Asian fusion
++ Lots of options to choose from in terms of base, protein, and veggies--great if you are vegetarian as the tofu was soft and tasty

Walk too fast in Larimer square and you might miss Bubu. It is down the steps and not right outside. They have a small patio in the stairwell and a decent amount of seating inside. It does get pretty busy for lunch though so it can be hard to find a seat then!

You can keep the price down unless you go for that tasty salmon then it can be a little spendy for lunch. Can&#39;t wait to come back and check out some of the other bowls."

There was an obnoxious worker who was talking down to her coworkers and screaming loudly across the kitchen. Hard to enjoy the food with such negative atmosphere. 

We got the OG Colorado bowl w/ steak. Salad only and steak was okay. Little tough but good seasoning. 

Thai bowl with raw salmon and rice. Salmon was so soft to the palate as usual is supposed to be. Thai sauce has a spicy kick and is very flavorful. 

Hawaiin bowl with raw tuna and rice. This one was bland but had the scrumptious Bubu balls in there. Almost like tiny shrimp flavored rice crackers the size of caviar.

Would come back for Togo!!"

Get your favorite toppings (my go-to is the Mexican) on top of a bed of white/brown rice, rice noodles or salad. I always get chicken (which is super flavorful chicken thigh, not dried-out breast meat), but they have other protein choices like fish and steak, or tofu if you&#39;re a veg-head.

Bubu takes their flavors to a fantastic level for just about anyone looking to get a healthy tasty meal.  Being Asian I struggle in downtown denver trying to find Asian&#39;esqe or Asian type of foods.  Most just fail and try to americanize themselves way too much and it loses it spice, flavors, too salty, piles of meat or whatever and very little rice or noodles.  So if you are looking for something out of the burrito, sandwich, or burger world.  This is a great option.  They really work hard getting out quality fresh flavorful food!

Bubu is a build your own Asian Fusion bowl or you can pick from one of their menu creations.  Like the menu states it is a simple three step process; pick a bowl, build your base, chose your protein.  I like the OG Colorado myself with added chicken, over greens, but the Northern California was not bad.  Naturally you can mix and match and get it just like you like.  They have bottled drinks and brewed ice tea.  There is a special hot sauce (made in Boulder I think) in the condiment area that for me really made the bowl flavors pop.  The dining area is small so be prepared to take it to go if you hit it during peak hours.  The staff has been pleasant each time I&#39;ve been in, and once the owner checked in on us, which is a nice touch.  Bubu is totally worth checking out."

It&#39;s still new enough that not a lot of people know about it but busy enough to be bustling.  If you get there after 11:30 there can be a line but food comes out FAST.

This is the place for you if:
- You&#39;re on some kind of clean eating/paleo/gluten free/whatever diet.  I am not but I also try to not eat too many &#34;useless&#34; carbs (I like to save the bread for things that are awesome like pizza and delicious pastries, not overly bready, boring sandwiches).
- You LOVE thoughtful, chef-created combinations that take different textures and tastes into account BUT
- You also like some level of customization
- You like fresh, interesting ingredients
- You like to pay less than $10 for lunch

The premise is you pick your set of toppings (which as I mention above, are thoughtful, interesting combos), you pick your base (brown or white rice, salad mix, or rice noodles), and pick your protein.  Your chosen protein is where total price comes into play and prices range from $7 (chicken) to $12 (raw tuna).  So far, I have only gone for the raw salmon ($8).  They also have shrimp and steak.  I would love to see a true vegetarian option in there (tofu? tempeh?) but I&#39;ve been pleased with the quality of the salmon so far.

I&#39;ve had three different bowls so far and all have been delicious.  I plan to try all of the bowls before I make a repeat.  The Hawaii Five-o (hearts of palm, edamame, bubu/toasted rice balls, shiitake mushrooms, raw fennel, and soy onion dressing and I also added avocado) is great with rice noodles.  Most recently I tried the Paleo (green beans, bell pepper, avocado, almonds, dried apricots, and carrot mustard dressing) over Bubu salad mix.  I thought salad mix would mean &#34;field greens&#34; but it was actually a crunchy, interesting mix of different baby kales and cabbages and maybe some greens I&#39;ve never even seen before.  The dressing on this one has been my favorite thus far.  The mustard they use is spicy and you get a sinusy burn with the more dressing heavy bites.  The OG Colorado (roasted carrots, quinoa, green chile, avocado, pumpkin seeds) was not my very favorite (I went for noodles and should have gotten salad mix) but the roasted carrots were awesome.  Tempeh as a protein would&#39;ve also been better with the OG (hint, hint).

On top of this, they have free cucumber water!  The one thing that keeps me from not going here every day is that it&#39;s a bit further from my office."

Other reviews describe the format in great detail so I won&#39;t here, but essentially they serve bowls where you choose a protein, a starch (greens for paleo), and other ingredients. You can choose a pre-arranged bowl like the Hawaii-Five-Oh or the Colorado; or you can design your own. I recommend doing the latter. 

Make sure and add some interesting ingredients you don&#39;t tend to enjoy much: &#34;bubu&#34; sprinkled, Pickled Red Chilies, green papaya slaw, flax seeds, etc. It&#39;s fun to choose several ingredients that end up tying together harmoniously. 

Everything and each ingredient is always fresh.

Though located in the lower level Larimer Square &#34;tunnel&#34; passage way, it&#39;s is closest to Larimer and is designed to allow plenty of natural light. There are community tables and separate seating. 

One very small issue is portion size. Definitely fair considering the quality of ingredients offered and the price, but sometimes a hungry, large male can feel less than full after enjoying a bowl.

A lunch like this for under $10 in Larimer Square just cannot be beat.  Local, non-chain restaurant a bonus."

Just double check before you leave. Otherwise the food is great and I&#39;m definitely a fan!"

I was on Reddit a few days ago and read a review someone posted about a new restaurant opening on 14th and Larimer. I was surprised to find out it was taking the spot of TAG Raw Bar, being that I used to pay that place a visit every Wednesday for industry night for some quick easy cheap sushi. 

I&#39;m a huge fan of quick lunch bowls. I used to live above a Tokyo Joe&#39;s, and have worked next to Illegal Pete&#39;s since I&#39;ve lived in Denver. I&#39;m also a pescatarian who loves raw fish, so this placed seemed just about right. I ordered their Hawaii Five O bowl with raw salmon as the protein, with avocado to top it off. Needless to say, it was everything I had hoped for. Every ingredient tasted fresh, and you could tell it was fresh. It had that good feeling full finish after the meal was done. 

The only reason I&#39;m not leaving a 5 star review is probably stupid. It&#39;s not because of the service or quality of food, but that they are not open on weekends. I work as a bartender in Lodo on weekends, and I would eat here every weekend before my shift if they were open. Lucky for me, I also work all week so I will definitely make this a usual spot to grab a nice quick meal to hold me over before a long shift (and they serve beer!). 

After leaving this place only short for roughly around 8$, I would highly recommend it to anyone who works/ spends a lot of time around the Lodo area. I actually snagged a few menus when I walked out and shared it with some friends to spread the word, and I&#39;m sure you will too when you try it. If I wasn&#39;t so satisfied/ full, I would&#39;ve probably ordered another bowl right then and there."

I came here because it is a new place on Larimer Square but not as good as it kind of looks. It&#39;s not very veggie friendly, (what kind of bowl place doesn&#39;t serve tofu?) the bowl itself was kind of bland. I totally could have made this at home.
I guess you&#39;d come here if you&#39;re trying to impress your date, just because it&#39;s a nice space, but then again when this was Poppycock it looked just as nice. I did eat for free but I am thankful for that, not worth my hard earned dollar.
The reason I say I&#39;m not sure on what type of restaurant this was because they had tons of options and you don&#39;t really get a chance to look at the menu because I felt rushed. Anyways, this was not for me. Thanks!"

The concept reminded me of the Wasabi Roll &amp; Go on University Blvd but 10x more vague. You could tell everyone in line was a bit thrown off by the menu. I mean, what on earth does &#34;Asian Herbs&#34; mean? Not only that, but because of the confusion, people took way longer to order than they should have. If they recreated the assembly line of your typical Subway or Chipotle, it would have worked out much better. People like visuals! Describing something as &#34;French&#34; means nothing until they can see it. Regardless, the result of my Create-Your-Own bowl was pretty decent - brown rice, fresh corn, hearts of palm, avocado, and raw tuna. It was basically sushi in a bowl. Unfortunately the soy onion dressing was way too pungent for my taste. I only poured in half of the container and I could taste nothing but the dressing for my entire meal. Oh, and that&#39;s the other thing! They use disposable utensils and such and, being the environmentalist I am, it breaks my heart seeing the amount of trash that they can accumulate in mere minutes. That and they only have one bin for recyclables hidden in a back corner. Tons of recyclables were thrown in the trash while I was there by people who didn&#39;t seek out the hidden recycling bin. 

All in all, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back for the convenience and reasonable prices. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d dine in though because they didn&#39;t keep the air on high enough."

As always with new food places I checked out the menu online before I went so I knew exactly what I wanted with the exception of dressing.

The food was fresh, delicious, and honestly better than I was expecting. I always figure the company makes pre-made combinations of ingredients because they taste good so I got the OG Colorado Bowl. I was a little hesitant of the roasted carrots but those and everything else in my bowl was delicious. I switched out the dressing from the house to a green goddess and it made the bowl. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone in the 14th and Larimer area. As there are a ton of choices if you don&#39;t want a pre-made bowl I suggest checking out all the options for making your own online before you go. There was a helpless woman standing in front of where you order and she seriously took about 5 minutes to finally decide what she wanted, as confused people were like are you in line? Not because she was lost or indecisive but because there are SO many choices. 

Healthy, delicious, and looking at the prices, a great deal for the amount of food you get."

It never happens to me. But I can say with 100% certainty that it happened to me when I tried Bubu. This place is brand new and they have it all down. The food is customizable, healthy, tasty, comes with ridiculously succulent chunks of chicken or raw fish or even vegetarian if you&#39;re one of those crazy people. You can choose your base: noodles, rice, salad. Choose your protein, choose your additions, choose your sauce, which they automatically put on the side instead of drowning your food, and be prepared for a heavenly meal. 

It&#39;s a small place but it&#39;s fast. The servers are friendly and efficient. I never understood the point of cucumber water until I tried theirs. I am sold on cucumber water for life now.  Best of all, this is probably the most affordable restaurant on Larimer St. I LOVE YOU BUBU"

The Plimoth is upscale food in a romantic little place. The patio was super cute in a neighborhood that doesn&#39;t have a lot of patios. Everything we tasted was amazing and the menu changes seasonally so we will head back to try new things. The staff was very friendly and explained the dishes well. 

My only criticism is that even though we had a reservation, we were sat at the high top bar next to the door. I don&#39;t mind the bar, and liked facing out the window but every group that came in would stand around us while waiting for their table in the tight entrance. It took a little of the romance out of our birthday celebration and made us skip staying a little longer for dessert. Next time I&#39;ll request a table."

The Plimoth is an adorable restaurant near the City Park in Denver that&#39;s open for dinner Monday through Saturday. I found the ambiance extremely romantic. They have a really nice patio, as well as a warm, inviting dining area inside. When we arrived around 6:30 PM on a Saturday, the dining room inside was already pretty packed, so we decided to sit on the patio, which was quiet and relaxing. I&#39;d recommend making a reservation on Open Table if you plan to come during a busy time.

In terms of the service, I thought our server was excellent. He checked in with us the perfect amount throughout the night and was extremely friendly.

In terms of food, I thought it was equally spectacular. For dinner, we ordered the Long Island Duck, which came with amaranth &amp; pumpkin seed porridge, juniper kraut, burnt carrots, and garden squash. I&#39;m obsessed with duck and thought this was delicious. We also ordered the Country Style Pork Rillette, which came with pickled jardinière, crostini, and funky mustard dollop. I also found this delicious. For dessert, we went with our server&#39;s recommendation and had the Palisade Peach Truffle, which came with vanilla custard, crème fraîche mousse, Kentucky butter cake, and almond streusel. I gobbled that completely whole. Probably one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had in a very long time. In terms of drinks, we tried ordering a white port, but they only had a little left. As a result, they brought us a glass of tawny port at no charge. I was SO impressed.

In sum, this is an amazing date spot that is sure to impress anyone."

The pork appetizer was ok. I had in issue with the consistency. The shrimp and grits, salad, and chicken were all delicious. The sausage in the shrimp and grits was spicy and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I&#39;m wasn&#39;t a fan of or understand the side with the chicken though.

I couldn&#39;t contain my excitement when my boyfriend told me he made reservations at this restaurant (which was quite difficult).  So we came in for dinner this Thursday after reading stellar reviews on Yelp.  The quaint restaurant successfully blends in with the rest of the homes in the neighborhood.  It&#39;s a rather cozy restaurant with less than a dozen tables and a small open kitchen overlooking the dining area.  We got there around 6:10 and it was already a packed house, which was a good sign.  The friendly host welcomed us in and gave us options for seating.  We decided to sit along the window seat so we could have the view of street (much to my boyfriend&#39;s delight, there was a Porche parked right in front).

DECOR:  Unassuming, inviting, warm and modern with touches of French country.  The host&#39;s stand is an old radio! 

FOOD: it&#39;s small seasonal menu features dishes that best showcase the fresh ingredients with a rustic French twist. We shared the farmers green salad with mung beans, frisée, radishes and cheese. It&#39;s really super fresh and light! For entrées, we had spinach spaezel with golden beets and farmer&#39;s cheese (highly recommended by our waiter) and Cracklin chicken. The entrées were a bit heavier than what we&#39;re used to but still extremely tasty! The chicken was cooked to crispy perfection with tender meat that falls off the bone. Now the spinach spaezel definitely hit all the right notes with creamy cheese, crunchy greens--everything just melts beautiful in your mouth!

SERVICE: Everyone from the host and our waiter was really attentive and helpful. That&#39;s the beauty of a small neighborhood restaurant! The only glitch was the long wait (~ 1 hour) for our entrées. Our waiter informed us that the kitchen received all orders at once so it&#39;s taking a bit longer than usual. The kitchen is rather small manned by 3 chefs. It must be challenging to keep up with the orders during peak dining hours. Also, we could really smell the smoke coming from the kitchen. Maybe it&#39;d be helpful to open up the front door to air out the smoke. Our host brought us complimentary port for the long wait. 

Overall, we really liked the simple farm-to-table approach to good food at Plimoth. Despite the long wait, we had an enjoyable dining experience here!"

Most of us arrived early, so this allowed us an opportunity to sample the cocktails.  There is no happy hour to be had here.  And although I found the cocktail pricing to be perilously high, it was a very tasty drink.

We started with the starter of Confit duck heart &#39;tapenade&#39; (grilled Ciabatta, Castelvetrano olives, duck prosciutto, blood orange zest &amp; parsley).  This was just slightly more salty than I would have liked (not surprising, with olives and prosciutto), but it was deeply flavorful and satisfying.  We followed this up with Cauliflower turnip gratinée (Pleasant Ridge Reserve mornay, Oyster mushrooms).  I will admit that I was skeptical.  Veggie gratin did not sound that special to me.  I am so glad that I was wrong.  This dish was served piping hot and was so richly delicious as to be hard to believe.  

For my main course, I went with the Boeuf à la Bourguignonne (root vegetable mélange, Crimini, bacon lardon, pain d&#39;epices, Dijon).  This was a good dish, but I was more disappointed in it than I was in anything else that I tried.  The bread served on the side was a grilled &#34;spice bread&#34;.  I found this off-puttingly sweet, but the server said it was popular.  My beef was tender and tasty, but had an overly large chunk of it that was just fat.  The veg in the dish was good, with the pearl onions being my favorite.  I also had a chance to taste the Toulouse sausage and smoked pork belly being enjoyed by one of my dining companions.  I must say, both pieces of protein were outstanding in texture and flavor.

The wine we had with the meal was quite nice.  Service was very good.  I shall return."

The location seems very obscure for a restaurant such as this, but it is always packed (tip: make a reservation, even on a weeknight!)

Another hint - this place is pricey! The menu online doesn&#39;t show prices, but there isn&#39;t a single entree under $20 and the portions aren&#39;t for sharing.  That being said, I would not call it overpriced, as I have never tasted a dish so outstanding for any less. 

I ordered the cracklin chicken (I won&#39;t even attempt the French pronunciations here) but it was served with a rich and hearty bean sauce. As a disclaimer, I don&#39;t even like chicken, but I listened to my fellow Yelpers, and it&#39;s safe to say I will be dreaming of this dish for months!  My boyfriend ordered the beef bourguignon, then exclaimed multiple times that he wished he had a loaf of bread to soak up the rest of the sauce with! So good!

Stunning delicious and not at all boring, but delightfully filling without stuffing us...all prepared in our eye sight in the very busy kitchen. The veggies were just terrific...like Brussel sprouts that were opened up leaf by leaf and lightly crisped in a pan...oh man!

I had an enjoyable time and really wanted to love my meal, but it fell a little short. Service was good and I liked the community environment and neighborhood feel but I wasn&#39;t blown over by all of the dishes we had. 

Cornbread appetizer- Amazing! Very sweet and buttery with a lovely, slightly tart rhubarb jam to accompany it. We really enjoyed this and highly recommend if you like sweet cornbread.

Greens and Lentil salad- Very basic but good! Vinaigrette dressed greens with green lentils.

Salmon- Was pretty disappointing to me. I Love salmon and was expecting it to be great but it just wasn&#39;t anything special. It was a cut from the tail, and I believe it was sockeye or something similar. I didn&#39;t enjoy the flavor much and it was a bit over-cooked. The wild rice mixed with the berry compote and the flavors just didn&#39;t meld well in my opinion. 

Crackling Chicken- Again, expected this to be amazing and it was just okay. The chicken thighs were pretty small and somewhat dry. The beet salad was pretty basic and I just wasn&#39;t blown over by it.

The restaurant itself was bright and open, pretty busy with a community feel. Service was attentive and friendly. Our food took a long time to come out, which I don&#39;t mind if the dish is super special and cooked to perfection but that was not my experience."

Upon being greeted by a very friendly hosted, and then seated, I was immediately enamored by the wine list, menu and rose list. Yep...they have their own rose list. That isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve seen before. I am not even a massive rose fan, but something about it made me smile!  

Our server, Mitch, was fantastic, provided great detail about menu options for us. The moral of the story here is everything on the menu has mass flavors, in part due to the heavy use of natural fats, butters and oils. So this is not a restaurant you eat at daily or while dieting, but it is a lovely restaurant none the less!

Obviously, I started with a sparkling rose, which as stated by our hostess, pairs well with everything on the menu, hence its solo list! We started with the cast iron cornbread with homemade jam to start. It was perfect! Crispy on the top and bottom, moist in the middle, and the jam was lovely. 

I had the halibut for my entree and it was a beautiful piece of fish. Mitch recommended I swap the squid ink cauliflower for the ramps and potatoes, and I am very glad I did. These potatoes were smoked and prepared in such a flavor rich way, I ate every last one of them.

It was a great meal from start to finish. I highly recommend."

That in itself makes you just want to hang out even if you didn&#39;t want anything to eat. But how you could not? The menu is full of exciting dishes!

Of course, the website only provides a sample menu so I don&#39;t know exactly what I had. I do know that the chicken stuck out to me and he highly recommended it so I went with it. It&#39;s best to go with your first gut feeling, IMHO. The only gripe I had was that it did take a bit long for the dish to come out but we weren&#39;t in a hurry so I could overlook that. As for the dish itself, it met all expectations from juiciness to taste to seasoning. The sides also complemented it really well. 

I found the service to be excellent and the staff, as a whole, just fun and friendly and inviting. The combination of the food, people, and atmosphere makes this a place you should absolutely check out."

This place is a true find. Mitch, our server is PHENOMENAL! Service, tempo, and recommendations were so spot-on, all four of the people in our party agreed to rely on Mitch to select our entrees for us - and we were not disappointed - but we all profoundly delighted.

The food, drinks, and desserts were all INCREDIBLE (except maybe the chicken liver pate for two of our members). But otherwise, everyone was absolutely euphoric with everything.

I will provide a better, more detailed review in the near future, but after having an awful brunch experience today, the morning after The Plimoth, I needed the catharsis of regaling an incredible meal and getting a bad dining experience out of my head.

The Plimoth is wonderful - first time here, but definitely not the last!"

We all started with an appetizer of Anson mills polenta and it was great. Then two of us got the spinach spatzle entrée and the other the smoked pork belly&#39;s and Toulouse sausage. I then made a choice that violated one of my long time food policies---never order chicken. The &#34;cracklin chicken&#34; just sounded exceptional and I fell!  It was not. It was just another dry chicken breast with a semi-crispy skin and not much of a tasty sauce.  I was very disappointed. I tasted every other entrée and they were very good and I would have rated the place a four star if I had not got the chicken. They should take this dry chicken breast off the menu in my opinion.
The wine was good
The desserts of olive cake and pot de crème were excellent
The service by Ben was perfect. 
I will never order  a chicken breast again."

This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Denver.  You can tell that the ingredients are great quality, fresh ingredients and the flavors are well accented in the dishes.  My favorite dish was the smoked pork belly which was well cooked and very flavorful.  I was a little hesitant about horseradish gnocchi, but it was subtle and very enjoyable.  Also notable was the cornbread-the best I&#39;ve ever had.  All of the dishes were well prepared-we cleaned every single plate that came across our table, including the blueberry and sweet corn dessert.

After a half dozen mosquito bites we decided it was a big mistake. We let the waiter know and he immediately relocated us to a small table indoors. Very accommodating. With drinks in hand, and the popcorn they seasoned in house we began our experience. 

For starters, we had the Farmers Cheese on warm brioche and the Plimoth beer bratwurst. The only reason you would offer the last bite to a friend is if you truly care for them, because I know I wanted this one bad. Truly delicious.

The main course we ordered the Cracklin&#39; Chicken. This dish, I don&#39;t know where to begin. With the flavorful crust atop the &#39;melt in your mouth&#39; chicken. It was fantastic

I got the chance to go to The Plimoth for a friend&#39;s birthday dinner. She was put on &#34;stand-by&#34; for a reservation the day before, but got a call the day of that they had a spot! As soon as I arrived, I loved the vibe. This place has an upscale, but homey feel (and I&#39;ll tell you now that you will pay upscale prices). A host took our coats for us and seated us promptly. The layout is small, and open, making it an exciting and loud hang out. The place was packed, there wasn&#39;t an empty seat. Our waiter was impressive! He had great suggestions and gave us great, attentive service. 

But let&#39;s get down to it...the food was stellar!! Our group of 4 tried 3 different dishes: 2 chicken, a beef, and a fish dish. My chicken was one of the best I&#39;ve had in months, with perfectly prepared sides. From start to finish the food was excellent. I will say, that I wasn&#39;t thrilled with any of the wines our group had, but who knows, it could have just been my mood."

I went for the first time a few months ago to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday. We had a reservation for a group of 8 or so, and as we waited for our table to come available, most of us grabbed a drink at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and made some fabulous recommendations on cocktails and beers. 

Once we sat down, the waiter explained the seasonal menu and partnerships with farmers in the area. Because everything is cooked from scratch, food does take a bit longer to come out to you, but oh my, is it worth it. While we waited, our waiter brought out some complimentary appetizers, which was a great way to keep us happy! 

At our table, there were a variety of entrees on display. The cracklin chicken, salmon, short rib, and others were represented. I myself ordered the brisket with chili and cornbread. The meat fell was soft. I could have eaten three helpings of the cornbread...and the fennel slaw was a great palate cleanser. 

Our group shared two desserts at the end of the night. One had apricots and another was a brownie with cherries that may have been the best dessert I&#39;ve ever tasted. We also had limoncello brought over by the waiter. 

The staff was super welcoming--in fact, I think we were there 45 minutes after they had closed...we didn&#39;t realize, and they never ushered us out!  

The next time I went back with my hubs, we sat outside for cocktails and an app. He was very impressed with all the produce being grown on site. And they&#39;re using it in their dishes. 

Bravo. Bravo."

I&#39;m so glad I finally got a chance to have dinner here with my BF on a weekday night. Mind you, it still get packed since it&#39;s a very snug place so make a reservation because it&#39;s totally worth it.

Our server was extremely nice and gave us outstanding recommendations which we choose most of the time. The ambience is cozy and can be romantic but is loud since it gets busy. Sitting outside is quieter, so if you&#39;re there on a nice night, perhaps opt for that.

The food was outstanding. I can&#39;t believe how good it was! We were given their gourmet popcorn to start and it was seasoned with their own garden veggies.

For our appetizer we got the farmer&#39;s cheese on warm brioche. OMG the brioche was so soft, it was like cake. I cannot explain how amazing this dish was. It just works! And gets you excited for everything else you&#39;re about to eat. We then got the Plimoth beer bratwurst with German red potato salad with whole grain mustards and the Cracklin&#39; chicken with spaetzle, spinach and bacon. The bratwurst was tender and well seasoned, sooooo good! And the usually I don&#39;t eat potato salad but the sauce and the mustard was such a great combination I couldn&#39;t resist! The chicken was out of this world as well! It was so moist. Like how do they cook their chicken to make it that heavenly?! 

The best part was that we still had room for dessert. We needed up getting two bc their portions were light enough and weren&#39;t too sweet. We got the butterscotch pot de creme which had a great caramel flavor to it and I loved the burnt marshmallow it came with. The other dessert was a passion fruit meringue with chocolate mousse inside. I know it sounds like a weird combination but wow did it blow my mind! The passion fruit gave it a nice tartness and the meringue was a nice touch :)"

I got the Harissa rubbed Colorado lamb and my fiancé got the cracklin chicken as his main entree. The lamb was tender and I really enjoyed my entree but my fiancé wasn&#39;t impressed with his; it was average...at least it was the day we went...I noticed the cracklin chicken is prepared differently every day so we will have to try it again next time. For dessert, we shared the blueberries and sweet corn ice cream and cookies...pretty unique with the subtle corn taste and it wasn&#39;t too sweet. We will be back!

Plimoth rock(s)! 

And hey, maybe you should know that &#34;Plimoth&#34; is the olde fashioned way to spell the name of the place where the Pilgrims landed . . . you know . . . Plymouth, Mass.

With simple but fashionable style, still great service, and absolutely delicious food, in the last 1 1/2+ years Plimoth has securely established itself as one of Denver best neighborhood high-end dining spots.

Started off our meal by sharing a bibb lettuce salad and then a serving of chicken liver pate. I had the crispy skinned chicken as my entree and my honey had the salmon. We shared a homemade coconut gelato for dessert which came with toasted coconut flakes and a dark chocolate cookie with a touch of salt. She had a gin and homemade tonic followed by a glass of chardonnay and I had the pinot noir followed by a glass of barbera. 

Everything was beyond fabulous. The intensity of the pate, which was served with a rhubarb and cherry compote, floored us. My chicken was finger-lickin&#39; succulent and was served with an unusual and superb burnt coriander bread sauce with charred carrots, honey and feta (!) The bill came to about $140, including a generous and well-deserved tip.

Bottom line: they&#39;ve gotten a bit more expensive than they used to be, but they&#39;re still a bargain for a place that serves fancy/schmancy food. At the beginning of 2014 you could go and spend between $25-$50 per person and get a meal worth literally twice the price. These days they&#39;re still priced at less than what a downtown equivalent restaurant would cost. However, for a full meal, including a drink or two, expect to spend around $40-$70 a person. But make no mistake, you&#39;re eating a meal that is worth 50% more than you&#39;re paying, and not only the food but also the service will leave you with a huge and happy smile. 

So remember, while Plimoth may rock, it also totally rules.

Cordially,

We arrived a little early to have a couple cocktails before dinner.  The bartender was eager and charismatic.  He took the time to go over each drink&#39;s ingredients before we ordered.  We were a little high maintenance with our questions, and he was either a.) genuinely excited to help us figure out our selection or b.) a master at faking it.  I settled on a whiskey drink, per his recommendation, and it hit the spot.  My friend opted for a tequila cocktail and she found it refreshing and the right amount of sweet.

Now for dinner.... ahhh!  I highly recommend the Farmer&#39;s Market salad.  Its ingredients are constantly evolving based on what&#39;s in season and what happens to be on the stands at the farmer&#39;s market that morning.  I got the Cracklin&#39; Chicken and enjoyed it, but a few of my friends ordered the beef brisket dish and I was incredibly jealous.  It was mouthwatering good, and accompanied by cornbread served in adorable little cast iron skillets.  I immediately went home and started looking online to figure out where to buy these in hopes of crafting a similar dish at home!

The kitchen was a little backed up once we were seated, so the waiter brought us some complimentary appetizers- a very nice gesture.  Even though the atmosphere inside the restaurant was buzzing and so was our group&#39;s conversation, it was nice to have something to munch on during our extended wait.  The waiter also served us up some complimentary limoncello shots to finish up our evening and toast to my birthday.  All in all, GREAT food, GREAT hospitality, and a place I will definitely return to."

What a delight it is to have a five star, truly creative meal without taking out a second mortgage.

First things first.  Remember OpenTable is your friend.  My party of four was seated right on time.  The word is out on these folks and they are busy.  If you don&#39;t have the OpenTable App on your phone, shame on you!

This is a tiny place.  The atmosphere here is warm and inviting.  However you can also expect tight seating and a fairly high noise level.  If you are planning an intimate romantic dinner, you are in the wrong place.

Our waitress for the evening was Katie and she was perfection the entire night.  She was so good that I would likely call ahead to check her schedule before I made my next reservation.  That&#39;s something I almost never do! 

While we perused the menu we were served a complimentary Aperitif which was a nice touch.  Pricing here is a breath of fresh air.  Entrees top out at $20 and appetizers around $10.  That&#39;s exceptional for this level of cuisine.  Specialty drinks are also about $10.  SUGGESTION- The owners, with just a little extra effort, could post the drink menu on their web site.  

Speaking of drinks, my party all ordered something different and we agreed that they were well made and priced fairly.  I enjoyed a Filthy Martini.  I also quaffed a craft IPA in a very unusual glass.  See my pic.

My appetizer was the best squash soup I have EVER HAD!  It was unbelievably rich and the flavors just exploded in my mouth.   I&#39;m still dreaming about it.

My entrée was Braised boeuf &#39;a la bordelaise&#39; with shaved cured foie gras, pommes purée aux celeriac, crispy onions and wilties.  I also ordered Brussel sprouts with polenta.  Both were over-the-top rich and delicious and stunning examples of New American cuisine at its very best.

The lovely wife and I shared a decadent chocolate pot de crème for dessert.  Sharing was the right move as we found that most of the dishes here are quite rich.

Competition is fierce in Denver but for me Chef Pete has designed a wonderful combination of cuisine, atmosphere and price point that&#39;s hard to beat."

This was the only downside. The server was very friendly and helpful. She recommended a rose wine, and my only regret is that we didn&#39;t get a bottle.  My friend and i split a salad.

All were fine, but the champion was the potatoes with pork belly. That one was memorable. One glitch was the time from ordering our entrees to delivery of the food. It seemed like it took an hour! But when the entrees arrived, all was forgiven. The cracklin&#39; chicken with cauliflower gratinee was particularly awesome.

The Plimoth isn&#39;t a &#34;scene,&#34; and they aren&#39;t putting on a big show for trendy clientele. It isn&#39;t designed and concepted within an inch of its life. It&#39;s just a down-to-earth, well-executed neighborhood brasserie that is audacious enough to think that good food can still be simple and relatively affordable. 
In fact, I almost gave The Plimoth four stars instead of five because I&#39;m so used to fine-dine dishes being so loaded down with bells and whistles, foams and shavings, unpronounceable ingredients-of-the-moment; menus being delivered in a bound book with too many options to process. Delicious? Yes, often. But when we got the streamlined menu at The Plimoth, followed by our plates (me: Cracklin&#39; Chicken, him: Beef Brisket), my initial reaction was, &#34;that&#39;s it?&#34; See, I&#39;d forgotten that well-prepared foods don&#39;t need a whole lot else. After the meal we had, I&#39;m definitely down with The Plimoth style. 

It&#39;s been said a lot on here, but the Cracklin&#39; Chicken is to die for. I wish I knew how they got the chicken so melt-in-your-mouth moist and tender (but that would take away some of the magic, now wouldn&#39;t it?). The Brisket was also excellent, as were our starters of Beet Salad and Chicken Pate. We also opted for wine pairings, from salad all the way through to dessert (which was the delectable Peaches and Cream). All the wines we tried were on point.

I also really enjoyed the subdued-yet-attentive service. I was never left wanting for anything, but I also wasn&#39;t hovered over or given a too-rehearsed song-and-dance number. Everything was just friendly and laid back--how dining should be."

I checked availability on Open Table a week ahead of time and I had my pick of times.  In my typical procrastinating fashion, I waited until the day before to actually make the reservation and my choices were 5:45 or 8:00.  Doh!  Well, I&#39;m getting older, so I guess that means I have eat during the early bird special now.  Mr. P. absolutely did not believe me when I told him that I couldn&#39;t get a table between 6:00 and 8:00 on a Wednesday night.  He later apologized when the restaurant was full by 6:30.

We were seated at a cozy two top beside the beautiful brick wall and near the front windows.  We ordered a couple of adult beverages (prosecco for me and a locally distilled whiskey for Mr. P.) and noshed on blue cheesy popcorn as we looked over the menu.  The menu is very limited so if you&#39;re a picky eater like me, you won&#39;t have a whole lot of choices.  I knew this coming in but didn&#39;t worry because I&#39;d heard such great things about this place that I knew I could find something I would enjoy.  Our server explained that the menu changes slightly every day depending upon what&#39;s freshly available.  He also highly recommended that we place our entire food order at one time to avoid any delays because the kitchen is tiny (seriously, it&#39;s super small) and complete orders help keep things running smoothly.  Speaking of service, our waiter was absolutely amazing.  I think his name was Eric and I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t remember exactly (too many birthdays, I guess).  He was attentive, informative, helpful and all-around delightful.

Our food was also amazing and delightful.  Mr. P. enjoyed an evening of pork with a pork rillettes appetizer and ribs for his entree.  I had a fresh and flavorful Swiss chard salad appetizer and the crackling chicken entree.  The chicken (locally sourced from Boulder) is placed in a super hot skillet so the skin gets nice and crispy but the meat stays incredibly tender and juicy.  My sides were a cheesy spaetzle and sauteed bacony spinach.  I know my descriptions aren&#39;t doing the cuisine the justice it deserves but we really did savor every bite.  We also took advantage of the suggested wine and beer pairings that came with each of our selections.  Every single menu item is paired with some kind of adult beverage - I love that!  Unfortunately, I made other plans for dessert but I won&#39;t make that mistake next time.

Hopefully, it won&#39;t take me such a long time to get back to The Plimoth.  Construction is already underway on an expansion into the empty space next door.  By the time patio season ends, there should be more of The Plimoth to love."

The food was out of this world and the service could not have been better. The drinks as well... It was really nice to be able to have such great cocktails with really amazing food. I have found a lot of places that have food on this level mostly just offer wine. The cocktails were on par with the Golden Moon Speakeasy and that says a lot.

I am in Denver for a little R&amp;R and my Airbnb host told me about the Plimouth. I was in no way disappointed. Johnny the bartender picked most of my meal...I like to be a little adventurous. Johnny surprised me with the chicken liver paté to start. It was incredible. I almost had it again for dessert! My entree was the crispy airline chicken with burnt bread sauce. WOW! what an incredible flavor profile! I finished with honey-lavender frozen custard and a wonderful sauterne to finish.

Amazing experience overall!  I may move to Denver just for the food."

The door staff acknowledged us right away even though the door/ entry was crowded &amp; kinda awkward.

The food menu was small. They were even out of one of the three &#34;medium sized&#34; appetizers.  We decided on 4 things to try. The brioche was more or less a piece of dry-edge brioche with a thin layer of creamy light cheese &amp; some blanched veggies. Not something to crave or order again. The pork rillette was awesome! It was spreadable  on crispy toast &amp; came with an amazing whole-grain mustard type accompaniment.  Order it, it is awesome!
The cracklin chicken was good &amp; had a really nice overall flavor &amp; the spaetzle was cooked perfectly. Get a little bit of everything on the plate together in one bite. Lastly the bratwurst itself was nicely flavored &amp; had a very garlicky flavor (which we all enjoyed) but the potato salad was so strong it took a bit of getting used to. The mustard &amp; horseradish (I think) was really overwhelming. 

Service was on the slower side &amp; we were never talked to once our entrees arrived.  I really wanted to order a glass of wine with the main course but our server wasn&#39;t around. On the plus side, when I did ask for a glass of wine (because a fellow had brought me a drink list when he saw me looking around), I wanted something that they didn&#39;t have by the glass. The waitress asked the manager for something &amp; she poured me a wine that was not available by the glass. 

 The manager, I&#39;m assuming, (nicely dressed gentleman) was keeping an eye on everything &amp; touched our table several times including dropping food &amp; clearing plates. 

In short, I was not wowed by service but the food was delicious &amp; I now have an idea of how the menu presents itself."

When we arrived at the restaurant our first reaction was how awesome the place smelled. The look and feel was very cutesy - and there was a pretty large bar. The host offered to take my coat and we were seated pretty quickly.

PRO&#39;s:
-Great energy
-Very cute server - Eric
-Complimentary Rose from the bar
-Cauliflower and turnip gratinee was beyond perfection. It was creamy and buttery and arrived to table in a petite cast iron pot. We shared it and it was a great start to our meal
-BF&#39;s chicken spaetzle was incredible. Cabbage had a great balance with the spaetzle texture
-Fantastic cocktails, he ordered a Manhattan and I ordered a Vodka cocktail. 


CON&#39;s:
-My gnocchi was pillowy but was TOO pillowy - it was like eating mashed potatoes
-My brocollini was way too salty


We were too full or dessert but it was a lovely experience. Thank you, Plimoth!"

Very busy on a Friday night (of course).  We didn&#39;t have a reservation, but got lucky, as the hostess had a cancellation and seated is within about 20 min.  The food does take longer, but like a lot of people have mentioned, it&#39;s because each dish is made from scratch... And you can definitely tell... Very fresh and full of flavor.  Had the pâté to start, which was delicious.  I had the pork medallions which I&#39;d highly recommend.  My dining partner had the cracklin&#39; chicken which was also very good.  Portion sizes are just right!  The wine list was also good and fairly priced."

It&#39;s wonderful to see such fine dining coming into what was once a neighborhood in Denver you would avoid.  Also, with the most expensive entree less than $20 you get very high quality food at reasonable prices.

I started with a tomato and bread salad - wonderful.  The house made kielbasa - amazing.  The pork - good, not great, but perhaps in reflection of the first two dishes.  The plum tart dessert - wonderful. My dining companion&#39;s Crackling Chicken - wish I had gotten that!

I would have given the plimouth 5 stars, but the service was a bit precious; the waiter a bit delayed in his attention, and his affect somewhat &#34;look at how wonderful we are and how lucky you are to be here&#34;.

Well we had checked in with the host about our reservation, and she told us they were getting our table ready. I looked across the tiny restaurant to see either the owner or the manager, on his hands and knees, diligently leveling our table; he would put a shim on one side, wiggle it, and then go to the other side, until it was completely stable. I knew that much attention to detail was a very good sign going forward. 

We waited for our friends and I was so happy that the waitress did not ignore us just because we were waiting for guests; I hate when restaurants act like an incomplete party is not deserving of drinks or service. My husband ordered a Scofflaw, which was a lot lighter and more refreshing than I had expected and I got a &#34;filthy martini&#34; which was admittedly not filthy, but it was well balanced; our friends&#39; Negroni&#39;s were amazing, and I would definitely order that in the future.

We were pleasantly surprised at how reasonably priced the menu is. For appetizers, the broccoli with housemade butter, the naan, and the kielbasa were all well seasoned, well cooked and clearly made in house. I think they should put the naan under the &#34;big small plate&#34; section and put the kielbasa in the small plate section; a 4-inch piece of kielbasa does not a &#34;big small plate&#34; make. That said, it was very good, with a very salty kraut and a flavorful but spicy grainy mustard. 

For main dishes, we had the cracklin&#39; chicken with shrimp etouffe, the gnocchi, and the pollack medallions with Israeli couscous, rouille bruschetta and saffron and orange. I found the saffron a bit overwhelming but the Israeli couscous salad was refreshing with fresh vegetable flavors and the pollack, rouille, and orange saffron broth went very well together. 

One great thing about the menu is everything has a suggested pairing; we ordered the chocolate pot de creme and my husband ordered the suggested port pairing, promising me a taste (I had to drive). Imagine our surprise when we were brought a free round of limoncello for our friends&#39; birthday, AND two very full pours of port. The waitress said &#34;I asked the bartender to split the pour and he was very generous.&#34; The generosity was appreciated. Better yet the pot de creme was very rich and well balanced; a good chocolate flavor balanced out by the whipped creme. The cookie was a little bland but the change in textures was nice with such a rich dish. 

It&#39;s a very small place but I would definitely bookmark The Plimoth for your future celebration. The prices are reasonable, the service is attentive without suffocation, and the food is all very well prepared."

Took a couple of friends (one birthday) early (4:30 pm) on Friday, May 2 to avoid the crowds.  Arrived on time and seated promptly.  No mention of the birthday which I had noted on Open Table throughout the visit.  Wasn&#39;t a big deal but I had expected a least a &#34;happy birthday&#34;.  (See my recent review of Capital Grille for how to do the birthday thing right.)  

New waiter this time who was not even close to being Mitch.  Pretty flat personality, no intro, not bad but just not special.  Had to ask for the amuse bouche (formerly wonderful gaufrette &#34;chips&#34; - changed to salted almonds - really? - yawn).  

So, the three of us started by sharing 4 appetizers - 

Ugly goat&#39;s ricotta gnocchi &#39;printanière&#39;, english peas, grilled ramp pesto, arbequina olive oil.  Maybe we just mis-ordered but this was our least favorite thing of the evening.  Read much better than it tasted - doughy gnocchi, over cooked peas, one tiny scorched ramp.  Meh.

Liver paté on sliced baguette, apple &amp; golden raison confiture, sieved cured egg yolk.  By far the best of the lot.  Had to ask for more bread.  When you&#39;ve got three people sharing don&#39;t skimp on the bread.  Birthday boy felt the confiture was too strong for the mild paté and overpowered it.  I kind of liked the sharp contrast.

Smoked scottish salmon salad, freshies, charred lemon &amp; crushed caper vinaigrette.  Way too fishy for me but the birthday boy grew up in Wisconsin (home to a lot of smoked fish) and he really loved it.

Cauliflower turnip gratineé, pleasant ridge reserve mornay, boutique mushrooms.  This has been my favorite starter here previously and I pushed for it.  Disappointing this time and lacking the unctuous, sinful richness I enjoyed previously.  Kind of dry (not enough mornay?) and no one loved it.

Entrees - 

Cracklin&#39; chicken, shrimp etouffeé, laurel scented basmati, freshies for me.  Loved the shrimp etouffeé.  Great spice and perfectly cooked shrimp.  The chicken, for me, was way overcooked hence the &#34;cracklin&#34; description.  Plopped on top of the shrimp etouffeé, it added nothing to the dish but that&#39;s just one man&#39;s opinion.

The other guys both had the vegetable ash rubbed bavette steak &#39;a la mirabeau&#39;, picnic potato salad, arugula.  It comes really almost buried in arugula which doesn&#39;t hold a lot of appeal for meat-heads.  Good reports on the actual steaks though.

No dessert.  Nothing sounded very appealing.  They could bump up their game with desserts IMO.

Booze.  Birthday boy had a glass of the red recommended for the steak.  Had to ask for it twice but liked it once he got it.

Quiet when we arrived except for a large table with toddlers.  Why do people bring little kids to a restaurant like this?  I can&#39;t imagine what they found to feed them.  To the host&#39;s credit he put them as far away from us a possible in the small space.  Pretty much full blown chaos when we left around 6:00.  Very scary looking large group of neighborhood teens hanging out just down the block.  I worry about that a bit, especially if they begin serving outside.  They may have by now - not sure if they&#39;ve gotten the required city permits.

So, not so special this visit.  Hope their overwhelming success and huge crowds aren&#39;t impacting their former high standards of food and service.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back if we can ever get in.  One so-so visit isn&#39;t enough reason to write them off in my book because previous visits were so spectacular."

Had the fall harvest bread, crispy chicken, and pork medallions.

If you take nothing away from this review, make sure you remember that they are ALWAYS busy, and reservations are necessary. This is a small place that is quickly gaining a LOT of city interest. 

Why are they always busy? BECAUSE THEIR FOOD IS GREAT. Not only that, the prices are reasonable, with apps coming in at approximately $10 or less, and all entrees costing at or around $20. Take my word for it, given the exceptional quality of the food, that is an absolutely rock solid value. 

Now to the food. We ordered two apps: the cauliflower turnip gratinee and the pork rillette. Both were very good, though if you&#39;re choosing only one app, the cauliflower turnip gratinee topped with perfectly prepared boutique mushrooms cannot be beat. Our entrees were the beef shank with fingerling potatoes and the crackling chicken with shrimp etouffee, respectively. Both were extremely tasty, with the chicken edging out the beef in taste by a very small margin. Last, for dessert we split the pot de creme and that might have been the best bite of the night for me (which is saying a lot as I loved everything). Perfect consistency, perfect sweetness, perfect richness. Coupled with a cappuccino it was truly exceptional. 

**Run, don&#39;t walk, to The Plimoth.** If for some reason you can&#39;t make reservations, go at off times in order to MAYBE get a seat at the bar or counter. This restaurant is unfortunately quite small so seating capacity is significantly limited, and, given that The Plimoth is fast becoming one of Denver&#39;s premiere dining establishments, this is only going to get worse. 

Good problem to have, I guess."

It&#39;s in a block of deserted buildings, with this gem at the end offering a small but complex menu of the highest quality.

I would agree with making a reservation, however it appeared on this Tuesday night that the restaurant was only occupied with scattered souls until around 6:30. So perhaps you can get in early during the week for a lovely dinner. Speaking of the food, the menu is small with a max of five entrees and five starters. There are plenty of drinks to be had of course, and wine pairings are suggested along with the food items. Very helpful.

That being said, a small menu in my mind should ROCK MY SOCKS given there is (assumed) focus on each of the dishes. While it did not cause any sock rockage, it was a great meal with fantastic flavors at a decent price point ($16 to $20 for entrees). I would return in a heartbeat.

Give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed."

I don&#39;t see it as a neighborhood eatery.  I see it as a destination restaurant.

To start, we ordered the squash soup and the brussel sprouts with polenta. DANG, that squash soup was killer, I could have had a larger bowl for an entire meal! Our server explained they use squash broth and that as an end result makes a squash soup much more savory than usual. The brussel sprouts with polenta were very good, and paired nicely with the soup. The entree choices all sounded exceptional, I made an agreement with my dining companion that we could share since we both wanted both the duck and the steak. I have to tell you, they were equally delectable. The crispy confit duck was fall off the bone tender, the sauce was well balanced and went great with the dirty rice. The steak was cooked perfectly with a nice bearnaise sauce, and those &#39;parmesan smashed potatoes&#39; were addictive. The space is lovely, and when the sun sets the lighting is so warm and cozy. The value of such quality food/ingredients/service is refreshing, I hope more eateries take from this. I was there on an early Tuesday night, and was probably one of the youngest people there, this is nothing but an observation. This place is going to change this neighborhood, it&#39;s already changed my mind to visit this area more often. yum."

My great hope is that the Plimoth survives forever (which it should, based on the reviews and the crowds) and that it shows some other businesses that North City Park is not a place to be feared. It&#39;s sad that the rest of this strip of business is empty and dilapidated, but let&#39;s all hope to see some businesses open next to the Plimoth soon.

The restaurant is a small, open room that looks to retain some of the old features of the building while being updated into a more modern, inviting space. It&#39;s a little tightly packed and as such the noise level is a little high, but it can&#39;t be helped. Our server was friendly and attentive, but with a menu that uses such cutesy terms (wilties, pearlies) and unusual ingredients, it would have been nice to hear a little bit of explanation on some of the menu items, especially since the menu only holds a handful of things at a time.

We had some chicken and some steak, and both were solid dishes. My steak frites were cooked appropriately though still had more chew to them than I like. The potatoes were tasty. But the dish was a bit simpler than I would have liked. The chicken was juicy and tasty but again, not completely memorable.

For such a nice restaurant, I have to give them props on their pricing. Dishes that would be $25 elsewhere all come in under $20 here. It&#39;s also amazing to see what they can pump out of such a small kitchen. The chef and owner must be bold people to see this space and challenge themselves to open this type of a restaurant.

We did enjoy our time here, but for a place that has such outstanding word of mouth, I guess I was expecting a little bit more. Because we live nearby, I&#39;m positive we&#39;ll be back and will try some other things, and I expect that we&#39;ll be blown away next time. For now, I would say we had a three star experience, but I&#39;m adding a fourth star out of goodwill, as a thank you for opening in our underserved hood."

I had heard it is as good or better than 
a longtime favorite, Z Cuisine. 
Disclosure, I have only been to The Plimoth once and Z Cuisine at least 300 times. 

Not.
Even.
Close.

The food here was ok, certainly edible, but not amazing nor memorable in any way.  Sadly I can&#39;t even recall what I had other than I didn&#39;t enjoy it and kept thinking, how can any of this be the food compared with Z Cuisine?  Other than The Plimoth offering many of the same dishes perfected by Z Cuisine that&#39;s where the similarities end.

Our table started with drinks which were each nicely done and delicious, followed by a complimentary tiny bowl of what looked and tasted to be day old popcorn, oddly seasoned and mostly old maids.  What?  I actually really enjoy some of the better bagged popcorns available but this offering fell under the table and even the dog walked away.  Out of four, two in our group ate it but said they kept eating it only because they were hungry.  Plus it added a sports bar feeling which was unwelcome in the quaint room. Hard to tell what the intention was but am hoping they skip that addition in the future. 

After my visit to The Plimoth I find all the rave Yelp reviews difficult to swallow.  I&#39;m guessing because of their &#34;nothing over $20&#34; statement many have been primarily influenced by their wallet.  Nothing wrong with that but the close comparisons to Z Cuisine are highly inaccurate IMO.  

We even went with suggestions from our annoyingly attempting to be in-the-know yet perhaps more-suited-for-selling-used-cars server, only one of which I can recall at this moment, the Cracklin Chicken ordered by a male in our group (who has only been to Z once) and his comment was, &#34;it&#39;s ok, I wouldn&#39;t order it again though&#34;.

I believe that the best cooks/chefs of anything from a burger on up could have learned and honed their skills in a barn or at the finest European culinary establishment.  What matters most to me is their intuition, creativity and execution.  The results of which are immediately evident and may linger for days, weeks or longer.  I would rather pay more at Z Cuisine for their always delicious, highly memorable fare less often than return for any of the several dishes shared by our party at The Plimoth.

Two and a half stars for the experience rounded up to be polite."

Cute spot outside but awkwardly quiet with no dinner music. Took forever to have the waiter come over, then another 20 mins for our drinks. No bread is given and with these price tags and their slow pace it would&#39;ve been nice to have something as we were starving. Oh wait I just remembered the tiniest bowls of stale popcorn were given after about 40 mins. What&#39;s with that?! The two women at our table both had the scallops and liked them but nothing special. Very small portion too- think 3 scallops came on the plate and they were small. Not as tender as they should have been for a $25 price tag. Both the men had the brisket and it was disgusting. It came as a firm brick with a layer of fat on top and then it was just a tough chewy piece of meat. Not what any of us expected for a brisket. Spoke up to tell the waiter and he goes I&#39;ll take one entree off the bill and let the chef know. Ok thanks fine. But why not two? Was just a weird response since they were both barely eaten but whatever not a huge deal. We each had 3 expensive drinks, ordered 3 appetizers and had desserts too. We were splurging on this place and for two out of four entrees to be that bad was super disappointing. $300+ on a place where we won&#39;t likely return. Fun to try these new hot spots but don&#39;t get the hype everyone&#39;s giving this place at all."

We happened to be in the neighborhood and though we didn&#39;t have a reservation, we only waited about 15 minutes before they were able to seat us.. Not bad on a Friday night. Inside isn&#39;t very big and can get a little loud, but it&#39;s definitely a nice space. 

The menu can be a little daunting.. It&#39;s not your average chicken-fish-or-beef-with-sides kinda situation. Everything is inventive, seasonal and unique. We tried the yellow cucumbers with a dab of mint cream to start and really enjoyed it.. Super light and refreshing for summertime. I ended up doing the cracklin&#39; chicken (gluten free) and my husband ordered the steak. Sounds pretty average right? Not at all! My chicken came with a side of mixed greens, summer squash and tomatoes in a delicioussss, light tomato sauce, SO good. The chicken was UNREAL. My husband loved his steak as well as their take on potato salad that came as a side with mixed greens. Both dishes were really well balanced, well-priced and nicely portioned. (Side note- while they don&#39;t have a gluten free menu, they had plenty of dishes that could be prepared gf if requested.)

It definitely took awhile to get our food, but I&#39;ll attribute that to it being a Friday night and to the quality of the meal.

We didn&#39;t have room for dessert, but there was something in a skillet that kept going by us and it looked pretty amazing. The wine/cocktail/beer list is also really well put together.. Lots of options and price-points to choose from.

There was nothing I would have changed about any of the food or drink we enjoyed. We shared the roasted beet salad and the pate plate to start, a perfectly cooked pork tenderloin and redfish for mains and finished with a light and delicious Palisade Peach Parfait. The only negative I can add is that we couldn&#39;t get a dessert to go. There was a chocolate and earl grey pot de creme we wished to try, but simply didn&#39;t have the room. Hopefully it will be there when we return. Which will be very soon."

Atmosphere: chic, romantic, modern (open kitchen - it&#39;s amazingly tiny for how many dishes flow out of there!), clean. Love.
Drinks: great selection of everything, from wine to cocktails to beer. Nice.
Food: the dishes we had were wonderful and creative, obviously the chefs are meticulous and know what they are doing!

But, not quite 5 star for me due to not having very little vegetarian options :-( And seemed to get a little flustered at the dairy-free request on top of that.  Come on guys, this is Denver, half of the city has some special diet needs!"

Had to keep the group very small because I couldn&#39;t get a reservation for more than 6 people.  And even then, 10 days in advanced, no earlier than 9pm.  Ouch.

Let&#39;s start with the good.  The food was OUTSTANDING.  Truly in awe of the chef.  Excellent job with everything we had.

The bad:  it&#39;s VERY loud here.  We couldn&#39;t hear our waiter, much less the person sitting diagonally in front of you.  I think even a party of 2 would have difficulty hearing each other.  This is definitely NOT a romantic restaurant or any place you&#39;d want to go for some sort of soothing ambiance.  

The service was casual, SLOW, and diner-eque.  Compare to Rioja, where I had been to the night before, and you&#39;d think that this was a diner.  

Being one of the last tables there, we overheard the bartender and another waiter discussing opening the door to the restaurant to &#34;freeze us out.&#34;  Yep.  They didn&#39;t want us in there anymore even though we ordered Appetizers, Entrees, and Dessert (and wine) and had JUST finished up with dessert.  SO...front door opens.  We start to freeze and decide to go ahead and leave.  The INSTANT the last person walked out they closed the door behind us (after it had been open for 10+ minutes).  REALLY?

BOTTOM LINE:  Great food, very loud environment, &#34;eh&#34; service, very poor customer service.

You got the hard part right (the food).  Please, fix the rest of your restaurant because food alone won&#39;t keep everyone coming back.  Hire better wait staff or train them a bit more, don&#39;t make your customers feel like they are getting kicked out (don&#39;t freeze them out), and install some carpets underneath the table to help buffer some of the sound."

Great un-intrusive service, fun atmosphere, and great food preparation and presentation. We both started with the Bibb Salad. Fantastic! Perfect balance between vinegar and sweet, fresh crisp greens and tasty nuts. The beef biscuit was more like a tender and flavorful pot roast with a nice accent sauce.  Melt in your moth goodness.    Due to my gluten intolerance the chef substituted a flavorful rice and bean dish. My wife enjoyed their succulent craklin chicken. We both shared a reasonably priced bottle of white Rioja from the wine list. For desert the house made Lemon cello was perfect; not as syrupy sweet as it can often be, but infused with great lemon flavor.  We will be back!"

First, reservations are a must.  Thre are probably 30 seats in the whole restaurant, so it is always packed. I personally was not a fan of hw crowded the tables are.  You can easily hear your neighbor&#39;s conversation.  On that note, I&#34;m not sure which &#34;neighborhood&#34; this eatery thinks it&#39;s in.  There were a lot of older couintry club type people eating here.  Not the crowd I was expecting given the location.

We started our meal with the mussels and then I had the cracklin chicken and the fiance had the braised beef shank.  I had a really hard time picking an appetizer.  It was a combination of everything sounded good, but just not good enough to choose one over any other.  As most other reviewers have commented, the chicken is the best chicken I have ever had.  It had more of a creole/gumbo flair that I wasn&#39;t expecting.  The braised beef was also incredibly tasty.  

To be honest, I have had better food, but it was still very good.  What really makes this review lose a star is the atmosphere and service.  In addition to the excessive noise, we had to wait about 10 minutes after being sat before our waiter even introduced herself (also worth mentioning that we had to wait about 15 minutes after our reservation to be seated)."

Also had the pate larger starter which was delicious but a little rich so we only ate half and brought half home.

Good: Their rooftop bar is awesome and we really enjoyed being there in the daytime. The bartender was always attentive, and we appreciated their wide selection of craft beer &amp; that they don&#39;t require a $10 minimum during the day. 

Mediocre: the night time vibe. It was alright, but just not as fun as other places and the audience definitely changes a bit.

Bad: their food. I don&#39;t even know where to begin here. We had a few people who ordered items and they were collectively pretty terrible. One of our group members, a strict vegetarian, ordered the mac n cheese entirely plan and it came with bacon and chicken in it. When she told the waiter this, he was extremely unapologetic and essentially blamed her for not being more specific (you can add bacon and chicken as upcharges, so why on earth would she need to specify?) We thought we might still take it because it looked decent and we didn&#39;t want to be a pain, but it was literally cold (not even warm) and the noodles needed at least a few more minutes of cook time (I&#39;m all for al dente, but this was straight up undercooked.) When we told the waiter this, he responded with &#34;well, I didn&#39;t make it.&#34; Okay....awesome customer service! The fries were brown for some reason, the chicken wings were bone dry, and add the crappy service on top of it and it was a pretty lackluster experience. 

So all in all, would highly recommend for beautiful weather roof top day drinking, but that&#39;s about it."

Not very original since every body that has a remote understanding of sports should be familiar with that term but its pretty awesome that they actually named this bar Hayters.

Beer pong brings me back to my college days and it was definitely time well spent. Since the cups they gave us were wet and appears washed and meant for re-use we played water pong and drank the beer on a separate cup. If you are done with beer pong, you can head upstairs to the rooftop to Tap Fourteen for some good music, drinks and a good view."

My friends and I visited from out of down and liked the looks of their menu and decided to stop in. Like most places in CO, great beer list to choose from. I opted to try their Mojito -- which was only OK. The mint was not muddled enough, and it tasted dilute. I wouldn&#39;t get this again.

The ambiance / scene -- I love it. I love the roof top bar, who doesn&#39;t like Corn-Hole or other fun beer games to play with friends?! Really cute bar, great place to hang out.

To me, the spot is great the bar is clean, and the service was really friendly. The review comes from the lackluster Mojito, and also the Mahi Mahi sandwich --was more than subpar. The fish was grilled to death, one of the driest pieces of fish I&#39;ve ever had. Dry, unflavorful and extremely disappointing. Most of my party enjoyed their food -- pretty good bison sliders, cheese curds, but also a bad taco ( one large lump of pork, side cut) thrown onto the taco. 

Fun spot to hang -- food seems inconsistent though"

I think it&#39;s the fake grass that adds a nice relaxing touch.  Went in on a beautiful 70-degree day last week and had a local Colorado whiskey to start.  They didn&#39;t have your regular Crown upstairs it was only Colorado drinks.  I have to admit, I&#39;m picky with whiskey but it was very good.  We then split an order of cheeseballs.  They were AWESOME.  I then had a gyro and was skeptical as most places don&#39;t make them as good as some of the middle eastern restaurants.  To my amazement, the gyro was outstanding.  I&#39;d be hard pressed to say that I&#39;ve had a better one anywhere else.  I believe this upstairs rooftop is called Tap 14.  

We went downstairs I believe on Friday or Saturday of last week when it was more of a part scene.  Maybe we just caught it on a bad night where everyone was blitzed but after one guy knocked our stool over and dang near fell into our table we headed out for somewhere a little more calm.  And that was only at like 8:00!  Will definitely go back but I think their rooftop is more of the place to be."

I was initially attracted to the place because of the name.  I found it funny and confident... Who would name their place &#34;Hayter&#39;s&#34; if they served nasty food for the public to &#34;hate on&#34;... get it? HA.... 

While exploring the website, I learned they were just more than a funny name; they also had extensive the menu with lots of &#34;fun&#34; foods, such as:  cheese curds, gyros, mac &amp; cheese, burgers, and multiple cocktail options, as well.  Not to mention the place is a few blocks away from me, the pictures showed a great bar atmosphere, and they offer silly activities like beer pong, etc.  

To save my harsh words - I have opted to bullet-point my critiques in hopes I am less wordy about my horrible dinner experience: 

- First: the fries (aka:  disgustingly soggy fries) that only got more soggy when we RE-cooked them at HOME because of the amount of grease they were prepared with. (and yes, I get how fries are made!) 

- Accompanied by the fries was the cheesesteak - which looked as it was prepared by a 5 year old and tasted just &#34;eh.. okay.&#34;  I can&#39;t really complain here... aside from the abundance of mushrooms. 

- Lastly, the description for the mac &amp; cheese was the most frustrating part of this experience: &#34;Our signature beer cheese sauce, bacon, and breadcrumbs tossed to a golden brown&#34; PLUS the secret 15 handfuls of Scallions &amp; Tomatoes!!!  This dish lacked all breadcrumbs, it was not toasted, and it literally tasted like nasty KFC mac &amp; cheese!!!! Thank the heavens I have a variety of Penzey&#39;s spices... 

Overall, save your money and go elsewhere. Or only go for that rad bar atmosphere and beer pong I was speaking of."

I was famished and ready to eat a cow, so I was ready to order as soon as we got there. 

So the rundown on the food...meh. I ate it all because I was starving, but otherwise I wouldn&#39;t really choose to eat there again. We ordered a burger and a basket of wings. The wings to be quite honest, were a little sickening. The hot sauce and the bleu cheese dressing were kinda bad? It wasn&#39;t very tasteful and I didn&#39;t end up eating a lot of it. The burger was ok. It&#39;s hard to mess up a burger...

I like the set up, out front you can smoke and/or people watch and the bathrooms are always well kept.

Can&#39;t remember exactly but it had blackberry whiskey ginger beer and lemon. We sat on the patio upstairs and the service was good, our waitress was friendly and made sure our drinks were full.

I wonder if they know how much most people hate them...or do they get off on that? But I digress...

Almost every time I walk into Hayter&#39;s there is a small crowd which means lots of space at the bar and prompt service. Drinks are reasonably priced - not college town cheap but not overpriced and under-poured either. They can make most any shot for around $6 which is nice for when you want something a bit off the beaten track.

Games a plenty such as beer pong, foos and skee ball, and this fun game where you slide in your debit card, enter four numbers, push a few buttons and out comes cash money! I always win at that game :-)

I&#39;ve had a few food items here - pretty good bar fare; just the right touch to help soak up some of the inevitable booze that will be consumed in mass quantities. I&#39;ve found the employees (including the bouncers) to be polite and attentive yet firm when needed; part of what keeps customers happy - and the location is aces!

This is a great bar to start the night off right with some good drinks, games, munchies what have you. Perhaps this is my new go-to place when the crew can&#39;t decide what to do...boom!"

The food is not very good, but it&#39;s much more of a bar than a restaurant so that figures.  Friendly service - she kept the beers coming knowing some of us were late to the party and needed to catch up.  

I guess their kitch is that they have beer pong, oversized Jenga and some other college-y games.  It&#39;s a bit of a frat bar, but for $10 I can drink a lot of beer, even if it is Coors Light."

It was just after lunch, there were no sports on and it wasn&#39;t very busy.  But the bartender was prompt and polite and was really good about checking up on us.

Looking around, I could tell that this would be a great place to hang out on game day.   Tons of floor space, lots of tables and TV&#39;s, good menu selection and plenty of distractions, e.g. pool, skeeball, shuffleboard, giant Jenga, etc.

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a great place to hang out, especially for the Chicago fans the bar caters to.  I had a low-key experience, but I&#39;m not about to let my review suffer for it.  This is a good sports bar."

So, for Day 7 of the 12 Drinking Days of Christmas we decended upon Hayters in LoDo. The happy hour crowd here is cool. I was the first to arrive and ended up chatting with the bartender &amp; a dude at the bar. The specials were $3 Drafts/Wells and $4 Hayterade, which I didn&#39;t have the guts to try, but enjoyed the Dales.

The food was great. I had a massive burger where the &#34;bun&#34; was 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and my burger was adorned with a fried egg and bacon. Heaven! The fries are really good here as well, nice and crispy. I heard good things around the table about the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese and grilled chicken sandwich.

The service was great. Our bartender was super friendly. When we moved over to a table, our server was totally nice about us moving tables 3 different times, ha ha. And, she was right on top of our separate checks, yay. 

The one down side here was the live music. Usually, I am all for it, but this is a small place and there isn&#39;t really anywhere to get away from it and talk with your table. We went to the far end and were still drowned out. It was set up more like a concert than live music in a bar. I&#39;ll avoid those nights in the future. 

Beware, parking on this street is a little tricky. There are a few music venues here, so they &#34;hood&#34; the parking meters so that the bands can park close &amp; unload. It can be frustrating.

Also, boo for Ladies night being Wells-only. I&#39;m a beer girl myself, so I have to say the best free drinks for ladies night still belongs to Brauns a couple blocks away. But, other than that, this is a great spot and I will definitely be back."

Everyone was super nice and there was a birthday party going on and they invited me to have some cupcakes. Ok on to the food. I had an excellent house salad with the homemade dressing.

The place is a little bit further than some of my other local spots but it is well worth the trek over the bridge.

My go to is the baby kale salad but the sandwiches are delish as well! Their dishes always have the freshest ingredients and the pastries look so delectable! I have had the GF cookie and I was shocked to find out it was GF - it was that good!

The prices are a little on the higher side but it is considered LoHi/Downtown so it is to be expected. The salads are quite large and the sandwiches quite substantial - they definitely make sure to give you a bang for your buck. Personally, I find this to be one of the most important traits of a good lunch place downtown.

The service is great. As a fast casual place, you order at the counter and they either (a) call your name out if its to go or (b) drop it at your table. The food is usually ready relatively quick (10-12mins tops) making it an easy place to take food to go. Additionally, there are always tables available. 

This place is a hidden gem on Platte - just on the fringe of downtown - and definitely worth the hike over there. I plan to come back soon for a quick lunch!"

I had the breakfast stromboli. It was okay, but a little dry. My partner had a breakfast sandwich and it suffered from the same issues as the stromboli. All items are premade and reheated in an oven with each order. I&#39;m not against that sort of thing, but it makes everything drier than they would be otherwise, so they need some sort of sauce (whatever) to help off balance that. The sandwich did include some sort of chilli stuff, but it was sparse and couldn&#39;t keep up with the dryness of the food. 

We also had a fruit bowl that looked beautiful, but the pineapple was not ripe and pretty sour.  And finally, we had a slice of lemon poppyseed bread that, again, looked good but turned out to be pretty stale.  

I&#39;m not getting why this place gets such good ratings. Maybe it&#39;s better for lunch or dinner?  I like the idea and format of this place: a casual foodie-food in a roomy environment, but that said, I doubt we will be going back."

A couple friends and I met for lunch here yesterday and were all really impressed.  The menu is written on a big chalkboard and then you get in line to order.  One of my friends had decided on a dish but as soon as she got to the register and saw the salad of the day she quickly changed her mind.  The salad of the day had fennel, mixed greens, beets, couscous and cranberries all tossed in a perfect vinaigrette.  I think it is a great idea to show the salad and pizza of the day (along with the cookies and pastries) while you are standing in line.  Lined up behind the counter are rows of their housemate potato chips.  Everything just says comfort and casual but delivers a solid culinary experience.

I opted for the blue shrimp sandwich with side salad and I did request a sample of the chips, which they very nicely gave us a small bowl of.  One bite of the sandwich and I was in love.  It had the perfect sauce, shrimp, avocado ratio.  Each bite was packed with a ton of flavor and just a hint of spice.  The salad was delicious and the chips were light and delicate with just a hint of an almost BBQ like flavor.

My friends enjoyed their salad of the day with shrimp add on and the curry bowl with lamb add on.  For dessert we all got something; two of us the butterscotch budino and the third the pumpkin bread pudding.  The pudding was insanely smooth and the little scoop of chocolate sorbet was the perfect touch.  I personally could have done without the sea salt on top; it was overly salty in certain bites.  But overall desserts were a slam dunk too.  We also sampled the chocolate chip cookie and apple fritter which were graciously offered to us.  The customer service was impeccable as well; although it is casual and you are given a number, the food was brought to our table.  Another nice touch was that we ordered desserts and those were delivered at the end of our meal.  In short, I am looking forward to trying more of their menu items; they&#39;ve earned repeat visits!"

I have been here on various occasions because I live next door. Their breakfast options are great, several breakfast sandwich options, as well as Stromboli, pizza, fruit and pastries. I like the sausage, and cheese, which comes with a side of their house smoky sauce. As much as I enjoy it, I still feel like there could be more flavor to the sandwich itself.

My favorite lunch item is the Italian. I always add pesto which I think is made in house. It is a little spicy and full of flavor, but maybe a little on the greasy side. Still, really delicious! They usually have some type of daily salad, also very good! Also, I think their fresh squeezed orange juice is some of the best/freshest I have ever tasted! 

It isn&#39;t a cheap eat, don&#39;t be fooled by the causal dinning atmosphere. For a sandwich and cookie it will cost you about $17."

Excellent food- lots of sandwiches, salads, soups, pastries, coffee, and boozy drinks too. Vegan friendly too. Today I had the butternut squash and pear soup with the sweet potato and avocado Thai salad. My husband enjoyed the smoked salmon bagel sandwich and an apple fritter.

Brider stems from its big brothers acorn and oak.  This concept however offers a fast casual approach to fine food. Be sure to try the Wagyu sandwich with a side of au jus. Sliding in at $14 this offering will blow your mouths mind. This slow cooked beef dunked in a warm, beefy broth will make your mouth happy. 

Double up with a friend and be sure to try the Bahn mi. Traditional Bahn mi comes with a bun that feels like it was made last year. Briders bun feels like it just slid out of an oven onto your plate. 

It&#39;s extended outdoor seating gives you a great view of the hustle and bustle of the area - bikers, walkers, shoppers, beer drinkers. It&#39;s an array of people watching representing Denver&#39;s finest. 

With one look at your watch, you&#39;ll be sure to keep an eye on your meter. You&#39;ll be hard pressed to find a decent parking spot in this area. In fact, I weathered 45 minutes of traffic and another 10 looking for a spot. All is well and worth it once you sit down, relax, and dive into their specialities. 

You&#39;ll be your own server at Brider - just a warm and friendly face will deliver your food. Way to work it my friends. 5 well deserved and delicious stars."

My husband had the lamb sandwich and it was also amazing. We also tried the gluten free chocolate chip cookie. They warmed it up for us and we downed it in minutes. 

This place is definitely a top contender for best lunch spots in Denver. I&#39;m still drooling over the salads. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try the others."

The (multi)award winning apple fritter is butter-licious goodness. We order one every visit (sorry waistline) and I carry around a picture of one that gets shared with ANYONE who says anything about apples, sweets, breakfast, yadda yadda. Visited today and they brought out a vegi stromboli instead of meat, which I thought I&#39;d ordered. My hubby thought they got it right but they jumped so quick to fix it AND brought me a beautiful bowl of fruit while I waited. Thank You, Brider! Honestly, it took me a few visits to settle into the concept that top quality food and slightly-above-casual prices were tied to ordering at the counter then picking your own seat, but now I like that it&#39;s the fastest path to getting me fed.

Pros: tasty apple fritters; creative breakfast strombolis; house made english muffins on the breakfast sammies; hearty and flavorful meatballs and polenta; sometimes they have fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and it tastes like sunshine

Cons: coffee is a little on bitter side (hubby disagrees); once added rotisserie chicken to roasted sweet potato &amp; avocado salad and it was hardly noticeable; prices feel a little steep when you aren&#39;t getting table service; having trouble trying more of the menu because I&#39;m stuck on favorites; that apple fritter is so delicious it&#39;s addictive and makes me concerned I don&#39;t spend more time exercising."

I was randomly yelping and quickly bookmarked this place. I don&#39;t know exactly what drew my attention (maybe the titillating pictures that were posted) but I&#39;m glad I did. 

I planned the start to my Saturday based on ensuring that it included lunch at Brider. 

After a quick beer at Denver beer Co (across the street) my journey began. 

I landed on the roasted lamb sandwich and I&#39;m glad I did. Ever bite was perfection. The harissa gave it a little kick of heat. Three thumbs up. 

Don&#39;t go looking for the dollar menu as my sandwich was $14 but in my opinion was worth it. Expect, with an adult beverage, to spend between $20-$25 per person. 

If you&#39;re in the area I highly recommend making this a stop

So much better than I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to put it in the same category. But whatever you call it, it IS delicious.

So, my husband has a thing for Acorn, but it&#39;s not good for our bank account to visit regularly. Now, with a more affordable option with the same great quality within walking distance of home, we might be in trouble. Since they are open for breakfast lunch and dinner, he might spend less but he can go more often.

Great drinks (with or without alcohol). Delicious food. Breakfast is simple but better than your average egg sandwich. Once they start making their own bagels (which they said is in the works), look out--this place might be unstoppable. 

Dinner options may look simple (choose your protein and your style/sides from 4 options), but every bite is a flavor bomb. Porchetta with kimchi? Why not! We tried it, and we loved it. The roasted chicken was delicious too. 

On one visit, they brought us a dessert on the house. First one&#39;s free, but then they hook you. The donut was really, really good.

I ended up going with the sweet potato- avocado and it did not disappoint.  It was a generous portion and the added rotisserie chicken took it from great to amazing.  I had a bite of my husband&#39;s meatball sandwich and loved that too!  The breakfast menu and rotisserie plates look incredible, so I will definitely be back to try those.

ROTISSERIE ROASTED CHICKEN &#34;BANH MI&#34; - $13

Pate aioli, pickled carrots &amp; cucumbers, Thai herbs and rotisserie roasted chicken on French baguette. Every element of that sandwich was so good.

The only drawback I see here is the price. For a fast-casual restaurant, it seems a little outrageous to spend $16+ on a kale salad with chicken. The quality itself is great, but I would come here more if the prices weren&#39;t as steep.

My girlfriend got the porchetta BLT; it was messy, but she really enjoyed it (and she very rarely eats meat).

Great atmosphere. The food? Shut up. So damn good. Service as well. They&#39;ve got a good thing going. 

Get the bacon + asparagus + egg salad. You&#39;ll get credit for being healthy when all the while you&#39;ll be basking in the fatty delicious decadence. 
Also, get an apple fritter. Bc apples are fruit and fruit is healthy."

This place was a gem and completely empty on a Sunday morning - shocking really. I mean I would think this would be a solid option for a quick breakfast or brunch/ lunch but maybe I just came at an off time. It has some great patio seating with good people watching opportunities. It&#39;s a order at the counter and be served setup which can be hit or miss but it was a hit when I was there! I&#39;d be back.

It was SO good and a very generous portion size.  So many times when you get a big salad it&#39;s all lettuce but this one was packed full of the good stuff!  Husband got a beef sandwich and that was really good too.  Nice clean atmosphere and I love that their patio is dog friendly.

We got the porchetta kimchi sandwich and the waygu beef sandwich. The porchetta kimchi sandwich was soooo flavorful. Hands down the winner. Waygu beef wasn&#39;t bad though. The one critique I would have is that it seems pretty pricey for sandwiches. The vibe of the place is definitely good though.

The best I can say is, I really enjoyed the gal at the counter, very helpful and patient.  The pizza looked really good, but from hearsay, it&#39;s greasy and mediocre.  The lamb sandwich sounded so good, but it was too greasy.  I&#39;m not sure if they are frying the meat before it&#39;s put on the bread.  The sandwiches are huge and the chips were good, but greasy with sugar.  The chicken banh mi was very sweet and I didn&#39;t taste much chili like a banh mi should.  The side salad of the day was an Italian one, but this actually needed grease or dressing and pepper.  The cookie with jelly in the middle, forgot the name, wasn&#39;t too sweet.

Full bar and coffee, order at the counter, they deliver the food.  I really wanted to like this place, but we tried a variety of items and didn&#39;t like much.  I&#39;m willing to try a breakfast sandwich but I&#39;m sticking to Curtis Club for a solid lunch sandwich."

Pulled up Yelp and came across this little place. Other people&#39;s reviews complained about the parking, but it wasn&#39;t so bad in my opinion. There&#39;s a parking garage right in the building next door that had plenty of space. Maybe it&#39;s because I went on a Sunday afternoon? 

My only complaint was the service. After we ordered our food in line, we sat down near the window. We waited and waited and nobody got us water so I had to go up by the bar and fill us up myself. When they brought my food, they had forgotten my soup. I assumed they had their hands full the first time around, so I waited for them to come back. But NOBODY never stopped by our table once. No server came by to check on us. Finally I was able to wave someone down and told them they had forgotten my soup. 

As for my dining experience, the food was delicious. I ordered chicken tortilla soup and turkey sandwich. Honestly the soup and sandwich together was a little too much for me to finish. They were both full sized. 

Towards the end of us finishing up, STILL.. nobody checked on us or refilled our drinks... Nothing. I ended up having to go to the front and ask for a box. 

The scene and atomism here was very fresh and modern. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s fancy but it&#39;s certainly not a fast food restaurant so I expected a little better service."

Our lunch came out to just over $40. Pretty pricy, but pretty tasty. I love their bread - our sandwiches had totally different but similarly crunchy and delicious bread! The wagyu French dip was jam-packed grill of flavor and my rotisserie bahn mi was fresh and yummy. My only minor complaint is that the herbs weren&#39;t distributed that well through the sandwich so some bites were amazing and some were just good.

The space is sleek and modern, but comfortable with a number of four-tops, a long communal table, and a large bar, so there is a surprising amount of seating. There&#39;s a printed menu on a stand as you enter plus a huge chalkboard menu with the latest items. Many of the pastries and sandwiches are also displayed in a large case with an open kitchen behind it. Everything looks neat, clean, and very appealing.

The breakfast sandwiches in the case looked interesting, but we had come for lunch so we passed on those. I ordered the &#34;Oak&#34; meatball sandwich and my friend had a meat and cheese panini. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We interacted with five different staffers and they were all very welcoming and enthusiastic. We ordered at the counter, then continued along the line to the register where we paid and were given a numbered tag to place on our table. Another friendly staffer brought the food to us almost immediately.

My meatball sandwich was huge and delicious with really deep, wonderful flavors and on a very tasty Ciabatta (see the photo). My friend&#39;s panini looked a little wimpy in comparison, but he said it was very filling. My sandwich made two full meals and I thought it was a very good value for the quality and amount of ingredients. 

The space is pleasant and light-filled from huge windows facing the street. I&#39;m eager to return to try some of the breakfast items, the pastries, and definitely the rotisserie chicken which is available after 4:00 p.m."

The food was excellent - we tried the rotisserie lamb as well as the half chicken. We each had a cocktail (enjoyed it) and a beer too. 

My main complaint about Brider is the price point. I thought the happy hour prices were very fair for beer but a little high for the (tap) cocktails. The dinner entree prices were in line with what I&#39;d expect for the food quality I received. However, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the &#34;order at the counter&#34; concept. It&#39;s just my personal preference but for the prices I paid for my food and drinks, I&#39;d rather not have to find my own seat or order at the counter (makes for confusion on how to tip as well).

However, we got mixed messages and some attitude about how and where to order. We got drinks (with a touch of attitude at the bar) and ordered food at the counter. Left credit cards at the bar and paid with a different method at the counter. Yet we still had a pseudo-server. Seems simply silly, clunky and it distracts from the food, relaxed environment. 

We probably won&#39;t return. I prefer service, not going counter to counter to hunt and peck for drinks and food."

My last meal was the meatball sandwich and holy toledo was it delicious. Hands down the best meatball sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. Typically when I think of meatball sandwiches I think of a poor sauce to meat ratio, and always too much cheese, not to mention they inevitably seem to fall apart. Brider to the rescue. The ciabatta had just a touch of crunch on the outside and was perfectly soft inside. The meatballs are so tender they just about fall apart. Add in some homemade broccoli raab pesto and provolone cheese and you will be a happy camper. I was amazed at the flavor coming out of this seemingly simple sandwich.

On a separate occasion I stopped in after work. It wasn&#39;t busy at all so I sat at the bar to have a cocktail before heading home. I tried the Across the Atlantic. Not gonna try to describe it, just know this; it was delicious. Chatted with the super friendly bartender and fellow Mass native for a bit while I enjoyed my libation. Brider has yet to disappoint."

If you like to receive bad service from a know it all college dropout that is waiting to hear back about that dispensary job, then this is the place for you. 

If you like a well made hearty sandwich like me, then this is the wrong place. I will admit I made a mistake when I order the $13 bahn mi. I will admit I deserve to be cursed by the Gods for think this bahn mi would be acceptable. What I got was not what anyone would call a good bahn mi.

We ordered the &#34;banh mi,&#34; the chicken pesto, a side salad, couple of beers, and a cookie. Everything was well done; though, the banh mi didn&#39;t ring of authenticity. I suppose that&#39;s to be expected at a Denver lunch spot, and it was honest of Brider to use quotation marks. The pickling was good, but I missed daikon and jalapeno. The chicken pesto sandwich was pretty standard but quite satisfying.

Though it seems gimmicky, I like the idea of doing beer, wine, cocktails, and other beverages on tap and hope to come back for drinks when I&#39;m next in town.

The only drawback is that the stone/tile/concrete walls and floor make the space quite loud, even at lunch with the window open... I hope they install some buffering."

I&#39;m not usually a big fan of rotisserie chicken but this is what chicken was meant to taste like - it&#39;s so tender and juicy. The salads also look super filling and fresh. For breakfast, we tried the egg, cheese and homemade sausage muffin which I would absolutely get again. We also tried the apple pie panini which tasted like dessert and who doesn&#39;t like dessert for breakfast? I get that it&#39;s a bit strange for people to have a lot of the food just sitting there on the counter and the germ factor I totally agree with but I like to be able to see a lot of the options in front of you.

Just destroyed the second best banh mi I&#39;ve ever had (2nd only to one eaten from a street vendor after a night of drinking on Cat Ba island), and the best sandwich I&#39;ve had in a long long time.

Brider fills a much needed void in the area and I couldn&#39;t be happier with the addition. With a quick walk up counter, you can choose one of their incredible sandwiches, or check out their display case of fresh delicious nom noms like a fresh made fritter, or a donut which looked like it had an outtie belly button. This place was hoppin and I can see why. I had the banh mi which was hands down ridiculous, and I&#39;ve had my fair share of these sandwiches. Bread had a slight crunch and that needed chew to it. Then comes the inside. Surrounding the super moist rotisserie chicken was a hint of spice from the jalapeño, fresh pickled veg, and the pate aioli which added a touch of sweetness/saltiness/meatiness. I tried to stop eating the sandwich but I couldn&#39;t. A banh mi is supposed to have it all: meat, spice, pickles, veg, salty, and sometimes sweet. This one absolutely nails it. So good I&#39;m pretty sure I ate my dog&#39;s stray hair that found it&#39;s way into the sauce. #sorryimnotsorry Mmmm, now to this deliciously buttery Brider Bar for dessert...I&#39;ll be back for more!!"

This is the third restaurant concept from bryan dayton and steven redzikowski; partners on oak at fourteenth in boulder and rino district&#39;s, acorn. While this third outpost had a bit of a quieter opening back in december, the buzz about this place is spreading like wild fire, keeping brider&#39;s rotisseries quite busy.brider restaurant denverBrider, which means to truss or tie, was the conceptual launching point for this restaurant. Rotisserie meats are the focus of brider and when you roast meats they are often tied to maintain their shape while cooking. There is no doubting the restaurants namesake after you bite into the porchetta sandwich with housemade kimchi + bright herb aioli or the chicken &#39;bahn mi&#39; which has layers of flavor from pickled veggies and thai herbs. Another favorite was the hearty shaved brussels sprout + cauliflower salad. The everything bagel chips added just the right amount of salty crunch and the segments of orange gave a nice balance of sweetness. I was also quite impressed with the herb-rubbed half chicken that I picked up for take-away last week; the juicy bird was extremely flavorful and was accompanied by lemon + chili wilted kale and roasted potatoes. I guess my only complaint would be, I wish there was more as I practically licked the to-go containers clean.

In addition to Brider&#39;s killer rotisserie program, they have a substantial counter filled with daily offerings from pastry chef, michael conti. Each day the expansive marble counter top is filled with fresh pastries, sweet treats, filling salads, to-go sandwiches and breakfast offerings. These grab-and-go options are ideal for the breakfast and lunch crowd in the lo-hi area looking to enjoy a quick bite but don&#39;t want to skimp on quality ingredients or high-caliber food. There are also craft beers, wines and a cocktail program that I am itching to try out upon my next visit.

Brider has quickly won me over with every visit and the food is what keeps me coming back for more. Platte street needed a casual and approachable dining option that caters more to the office workers and lo-hi dwellers and brider is filling that void quite nicely. I only hope that my new favorite lunch spot will continue to surprise and delight me with their menu as the months go on."

When we got there it was a little strange feeling, no menu posted, and the pastries all sitting out unwrapped with no barrier to guard from people sneezing or touching.  We asked if they have a kids menu and the cashier said no, they offer just the printed menu, then one of the chefs in back said they could do meatballs and grilled cheese, so we settled on both.  We got hesitation again when we asked about kids juices, again nothing offered but the complicated adult juices (which looked delicious, just no way my kids would drink), so we settled on water (you would think a fast casual concept would be more family friendly?)  For us we got the $18 half chicken and the French dip.  The staff was friendly and brought us out water and our food quickly.  The meatballs were delicious, just like at Acorn, but for a kid they were very spicy.  The grilled cheese was tasty so my kids shared it.  The French dip was ok, too much horseradish and I think they top it with mustard greens so the flavors were very strong.  The aujus was just a small cup of of what I assume was the unseasoned pan drippings (with a ton of grease on top), and then it was served with some pickled carrots.  All extremely strong flavors and it left me trying to talk myself into whether I liked it or not.  The half chicken we opted for the yogurt and tabouli, it was good, the bread served with it was delicious, unfortunately the chicken was a touch pink so we didn&#39;t enjoy all of it.  Also the &#34;communal&#34; water tub was empty so when we went to refill our waters there wasn&#39;t any, which seemed odd again as it was 6:30 and the dining room was empty.  

Very friendly staff, but some definite kinks need to be worked out."

I tried their French dip for lunch and, while I normally enjoy spicy food (or whatever you would categorize horseradish as), the horseradish was so overpowering I literally couldn&#39;t even taste the beef or bread. My nose was burning the entire time like I had just eaten about a pound of horseradish. 

The service is slowwwww and it took us over half an hour to get a premade breakfast sandwich and a fritter (which required no preparation at all besides putting it on a plate). Several people were working, it wasn&#39;t busy, and honestly that&#39;s just ridiculous.

The place is bright, open and comfortable. When you fist walk in, it can definitely be a little confusing since you have to order at the counter, which it is not obvious. Once you know the drill, it&#39;s pretty straightforward. I think they are still working out the kinks with service.The staff at Brider feels distant, even cold. Not engaged. Rarely a member of their staff will come to clear up the table of empty plates or glasses or ask if they you need anything else. I  love Acorn and honestly, I was expecting the same level of service. I understand that Brider is a much more casual concept with a different service structure but  it can still be warm and attentive.
Food  in general lines is quite good.  I have tasted several of their salads and all of them have been delicious. Sandwiches have been hit or miss. I feel that their version of the banh mi lacks the punch of flavor that authentic Vietnamese ones have. Maybe more pickled vegetables and more cilantro? Also, the baguette for some reason tastes stale and leathery. The wonderful thing about the banh mi spots over Federal is that they bake their own baguettes several times a day which yields to a bread  that is always fresh, since baguettes have such a short life. I hope that they can figure out a way to solve that problem because their rotisserie chicken in that sandwich is very moist and flavorful. The lamb sandwich is great. I also love the shrimp and their falafel sandwich. Small but nice wine list. Good cocktail menu.  Pastries and desserts are extremely disappointing. The display looks very attractive but the taste is underwhelming to say the least.  Muffins and cakes are very dense, dry and completely flavorless.  Not the best last memory of a meal. 
I like this place and I am confident that they&#39;ll iron out their hiccups. Then, Brider could be the whole package."

The atmosphere is kind of strange, like a cross between ModMarket and an office building food court. I got the pork sandwich and my boyfriend got the lamb sandwich and a coffee (total of $32 which seemed steep to me, given that neither sandwich came with a side). He loved his coffee and our food was served quickly and seemed freshly prepared. The flavors were interesting but overall both sandwiches were VERY greasy and salty.

The fact that Bryan and Steven were actually working there added to the enjoyment and quality of the food and the drink. Now all 3 restaurants are shadows of what Oak once was. It is very obvious that the focus of the owners isn&#39;t on food or drink preparation or quality. With countless magazine interviews, food and wine festivals, and just enjoying the limelight I can&#39;t imagine why they would work in their establishments. We went into Brider for breakfast in Saturday. The english muffin with bacon, egg, and cheese I ordered was horrible. They removed it from the pastry case and placed it in the kitchen window. Then several minutes passed while no on e was present in the kitchen. Someone appeared and placed the 4 tickets worth of food in the oven. We waited around 10 mire minutes while my food fried in the oven. After an extended amount of time the bartender and manager left the empty bar to help expedite some food. After 15-20 minuted i received my sandwich and the bottom muffin was soaked in grease and blistering hot. The egg was cooked to death and the bacon was like leather. For the amount of time that we waited the kitchen could have made the item from scratch. I don&#39;t understand why it takes so long to cook a grab and go item to a level that is almost inedible."

We ordered based on the cashiers recommendations and sat down at a table outside.  We promptly got our wine order and was offered waters by the nice gentleman serving us, and our food arrived soon after.

The food is okay, nothing to post pics on Facebook, but okay, and the staff is friendly enough. My biggest complaint is the manager that was on duty when we went at around 6 on a weekday. I didn&#39;t catch his name but he was abrupt, in a hurry, and stopped by our table to ask how we were doing (I&#39;m guessing this is a mandatory thing) and I wish he hadn&#39;t. He basically ruined the whole experience with his automated responses and questions. Yuck!  He seemed rushed, frustrated, and unhappy with his job.

While the food I&#39;ve had is pretty good, it is extremely over priced.  My first trip I ordered a salad and added the rotiserrie chicken.  The total came to a little over $16, which is pretty excessive for a fast casual place.  Adding chicken alone was $4 and there really wasn&#39;t that much of it.  None of their salads include a protein, so you have to add.  The breakfast sandwich I tried on my second visit was pretty good, but at $6, left a little to be desired, same for the $8 soup.

If I go to a local place for a breakfast sandwich, I expect it to be prepared fresh rather than squashed in a panini press.

To give some background, I grew up in Houston, Tx where there is a lot of cajun food and have visited New Orleans several times. That being said, I am by no means an expert but I think I have more experience than many. 

I ordered a bowl of the gumbo which is pretty much my favorite thing to order whenever it&#39;s available. I really wasn&#39;t feeling this gumbo. It was kind of bland and potato-y? It felt more like a winter squash soup which was just strange to me. I&#39;m used to either using a file powder or something like okra to thicken up my gumbo but this gumbo was still thicker than any other gumbo I&#39;ve had. I also like my gumbo pretty spicy and this gumbo didn&#39;t fit the bill. I still ate it but it didn&#39;t excite me. I do think that gumbo is one of those dishes that can be very different depending on who makes it. Everybody kind of has their own view on the perfect gumbo. I&#39;d still be willing to try something else here before making a final judgment as it has so many great reviews. Maybe I&#39;ll try the crawfish etouffee or the red beans and rice next time."

The friendly owner Henry greeted us. Very cold IPA beers. Many appetizers to try.  We opted for gizzards, hush puppies and cream cheese filled peppers. Dinner was the muffuletta (amazing), rice and beans with sausage (impressive) and gumbo with sausage and shrimp. This is quality food where the heat is not a punch of overwhelming flavor, rather subtle and when you are finished the heat arrives. Not too much, but enough to add to the flavor. Our waitress Dani helped us make the right choices. The bathroom is modern and clean. Plenty of TV screens.  The area was safe but a bit out of our comfort zone, but it was fun and we will be back.  It is worth the trip."

Henry (the owner) is personable and cooks authentic New Orleans cuisine! 

I had 6 wings with house sauce and a cup of the red beans and rice. The previous reviews that people left about the red beans and rice were spot on! GREAT flavor! The wings were tasty and had a sweet chili type of sauce.

Two other people in our group had the catfish po&#39;boys and added a side of French fries. They both raved that everything was delicious.

We also tried the bananas foster dessert. I&#39;m not even a fan of bananas and I found myself in dessert heaven.

A few added features: several big screen TVs, a jukebox, bar, and an outdoor patio."

It was perfectly seasoned and spiced. The menu sticks to just the classics: gumbo, crawfish etoufee, red beans and rice, and po-boys. We definitely want to come back and try the po-boys!

We got hurricanes, and those were also the real deal...the best hurricanes I&#39;ve had in Denver.

A little bit less spicy than I anticipated, so we threw on a little bit of Louisiana Hot Sauce.

The atmosphere here is very cozy and warm, complete with a jukebox in the corner.

Nola does a good job of bringing New Orleans to Denver. The atmosphere is awesome, the clientele is about as diverse as it gets, they play good music on the juke box, and they&#39;ve got a great bar. This is one of the few places you can find Abita on tap. 

This place does not have a huge menu, but what they do have is done VERY well. I&#39;d prefer this over a more comprehensive menu of mediocre food, which I&#39;ve seen at other restaurants. I tried the Gumbo and Crawfish Étouffée. Gumbo is great, but the Étouffée was the best I&#39;ve ever had (including in New Orleans). I can&#39;t say enough about this bowl of heavenly Goodness.

He has a good sense of humor! However, I do plan to have a group come over to experience his delicious cooking and am happy to share to the world how great this place is. What a gem. 

I wish he had a place like this in Aurora. **sigh** It&#39;s my birthday wish. :-) I recommend each dish I listed, but I will say that if you&#39;re craving Leidenheimer bread, order a Po&#39; Boy. Life is short, so I would order everything on his menu. You will leave very full and happy. It&#39;s good to support this local business.  Plus, the Crawfish Étouffée is very flavorful.

The gumbo is freaking fantastic (gumbo is my thing)! I went in for the first time today. I&#39;ve been curious for some time now. Maggie waited on me on a mellow Friday afternoon. She was very sweet, informative and stood by the product. She informed me that the gumbo was only made by the owner and is fresh daily. It shows!!! I also had the red beans and rice (swoon).

We only got our food after the waitress came over to us and said, &#34;what did you order again?&#34;

I am not exaggerating, we waited over 2 hours. 

Tonight we ordered the otoro, and the fish tasted dry and old. They made what is supposed to be the most valued piece of sushi tasteless. I literally gagged and spit it out. Being the only people in a restaurant, you&#39;d think you would get decent service. However not once was our water or green tea refilled and we had to remind the waiter constantly of our order and try to get attention while they were occupied socializing. For the quality of fish and the service, this place is not worth the cost and the stomach ache. Or the headache."

There was some mix up on which dishes we ordered and then they took the check away from us after we already started to pay and said they forgot to charge us for one soft drink. I would think that if they messed up, they would just say the soft drink was on the house. At least that&#39;s the kind of service I&#39;m used to. 

Altogether average place to eat with pretty bad service."

This place is definitely good when you want to get your sushi fix or if you want to be adventurous and try a bunch of new rolls but if you&#39;re looking for top quality pieces of fish or service, best to go somewhere without the AYCE option (you can order regular menu items here without doing AYCE). We came here on a Friday night and sat in the general dining area which we never tend to do at sushi places, I really dig sitting at the counter and getting the sushi bar experience plus I have found the service to be better there. Unfortunately the sushi bar at Sushi Totoro is in direct line with the door so any time the open or closes, you feel a big rush of air coming in. Service was spotty, our server took my order but never put it in so my husband got all of his stuff while I just picked off of his until we could flag our girl down. Thankfully another lady started taking care of us and she was on the ball with everything. You really can&#39;t go wrong with tempura, seaweed salad, nigiri and a specialty roll or two. Be sure to note that you don&#39;t want a lot of sauce on the rolls if they come with it as they tend to go a little crazy with the sauce.
 Regardless, I will be back again when I want to get my sushi fix close to home. This is a great place for sushi beginners or large groups as they have some private dining areas in the back."
sushi-totoro-aurora,Kelly S.,TpxddQMgdARmAxQhTa-Hig,"Aurora, CO",1,1,0,65,110,Fxkqi6epmQj_V9JaNyqGmA,5.0,2016-05-22,"Let me begin by saying I am an experienced sushi enjoyer, a Sushi Katsu regular for over 10 years and an aurora native. Not that ANY of this matters, as this is Yelp and I am not a food critic, but what the hell, you&#39;re reading it. :)

My family received a coupon in the mail from Totoro. Seasoned veterans of Katsu, of course we were wary, as Hana Sushi across the street was a major disappointment, so we never trust new sushi places. Then we start seeing the reviews pour in online on Google and on Yelp. Okay, fine, our interest is peaked, let&#39;s try them out. 

It took us 2 minutes from the driveway to their restaurant. Already, the location is great. 

The lobby was quiet and clean. A little sparse in decor but we like that. We don&#39;t like when restaurants are IN YOUR FACE with art and vases and fake plants and awkward light fixtures and the like. Simple is sometimes better. 

The service was fast and friendly, and the rolls were some of the best tasting sushi rolls I&#39;ve ever had, and that&#39;s saying a lot since I&#39;ve had everything on the menu at Katsu, not to mention I&#39;ve been to like a thousand sushi restaurants in my life. The rolls at Totoro are Colorado-themed, so they have names like the E-470, Nuggets Roll, Broncos Roll and (my personal favorite) the Rockies roll. The plating is very classy so naturally, I scarfed them down so fast I&#39;m sure I gave the sushi chefs a run for their money. The wasabi was a lighter green color than I am used to seeing, but BOY DOES IT BITE! I was very pleased to have my ass handed to me. The ginger was nice and crisp and they were very generous when we asked for more. 

I have two complaints though, but not enough to warrant removing a star. One thing is the hand soap in the bathroom. It smells like dish soap and I don&#39;t use dish soap on my hands normally because it dries my skin out, so please Totoro, replace that? Also, I would like to see some kind of happy hour or drink deal. I did not order alcohol for that reason, so it would be nice to see, but I understand if you are waiting until you get busier. 

It&#39;s a bonus that an actual Japanese family runs the place. My mother (an American USAF veteran) was stationed at Misowa in the 80&#39;s, which is where the owner is from! Small world! Saori was super sweet and very attentive. We can&#39;t wait to come back. Even writing this review makes me want to go back there!

I kind of don&#39;t want the word to get out about this place because then they will become too busy for us to waltz into last minute, but that would be selfish and I want to share the better businesses of Denver with the world. :) let&#39;s support this business and give them a try!"

Not crowded at all and very clean and roomy. The decorations are a little lacking, but the food is terrific and fresh. Very authentic except the chefs behind the bar weren&#39;t very friendly. Hmm. 

Our Nigiri had very tender pieces of fish!! (Except the octopus was too chewy and I had to spit it out.) the presentation was nice and every piece was delicious.  Their rice is the short grain I&#39;d come to love when I lived in Japan long ago and nearby there was a Japanese family of 8 people enjoying their meal rather heartily. 

Looking at the colorful and nice menu, I was very pleased that many rolls had been named after many of my favorite Denver points of interest like Broncos roll, Rockies roll, D.I.A. Roll, Red Rock roll and E-470 roll to name a few. Creative and delightfully tasty! 

Take my word for it, this place is FABULOUS! I kind of don&#39;t want the rest of the world to know about it because it&#39;s my new favorite restaurant. Oh well. Haha."

The two chefs at the sushi bar were welcoming and friendly.  I found out that one of them was the owner.  He took the time to have a brief conversation with me and he said they opened a little over a year ago.

I arrived shortly after they opened at 11:30.  It was very clean and (mostly) quiet.  There were maybe 3 other occupied tables.  I really loved this!  I had second thoughts about posting a positive review because I&#39;d hate to see this place get packed.  The only downfall of the atmosphere was a family in the back of the restaurant letting their toddler run around and yell.  I like venturing out to eat during off peak hours to avoid this.  I wish parents would control their crotch fruit in public.

I was brought a very small amount of ginger and wasabi.  The wasabi had an unusual somewhat creamy consistency and was watered down, however it still packed a punch, tasted fine and dissolved easily into the soy sauce.  I just thought this was worth mentioning.  I did ask for extra wasabi and ginger as I have a strong need for wasabi so powerful that it&#39;s a religious experience!  The waitress was fantastic!  Wasabi and ginger were brought to me promptly and she kept my water full without me having to ask.  This is always something that makes a restaurant shine!

The sushi was good.  It wasn&#39;t spectacular, it didn&#39;t suck, but it was exactly what I&#39;d expect from an all you can eat establishment.  The sauce on the albacore nigiri was odd.  I doubt I&#39;ll order that one again, otherwise, I enjoyed everything I tried.  The only other con was the rice to nigiri ratio was too high.  I understand that making a rule to clean your plate or you&#39;ll be charged and stuffing your customers with rice is how places like this make money, however, see the photo I posted of the piece of saba I ate.  That was way too much rice.

Overall, I really like this place.  The only reasons they didn&#39;t get 5 stars were the odd sauce on the albacore and the unnecessarily large portions of rice on the nigiri.  I got comfortably full for under $20 with tip, the staff was great and I had a nice lunch.  I have been quite disappointed in another all you can eat sushi establishment in the area due to being uncomfortably overcrowded and some serious sanitary issues I have witnessed first hand.  I have now found their replacement.  Thank you Sushi Totoro!  I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

The service is great- maybe one of the best services I&#39;ve had. Our waiter was kind and attentive. Him and the other waitress were always checking up on us and removing plates, filling waters, etc etc.

The sushi is not the best but not the worst. The rice is a tad bland, and the fish tastes rubbery. It simply wasn&#39;t up to par.

Uh-uh, girlfren (triple snap)! And with that delightful outburst, why don&#39;t I just regale you a bit about Sushi Totoro in Aurora?

When you enter, you will find a substantial section of the space decorated in homage to the perky (and rather, um, robust) anime character for whom the eatery is named. And your tongue will be similarly brightened and bemused by the plates that make their way to your table. I would feel like a complete heel if I didn&#39;t tell you to begin with some monkey brains (ding ding ding!) as that&#39;s one of my favorite starters here. Don&#39;t worry! No primates were harmed to make this dish, which in fact contains a deep-fried avocado stuffed with crab and spicy tuna. The cream-cheese-and-fish-filled fried mushrooms are another choice for you to consider, along with grilled yellowtail or salmon collar, various types of tempura, and Agedashi Tofu (deep-fried beancurd in a bonito/kelp broth with soy sauce and sweet rice wine). Any of these, in fact, will be a more-than-pleasant precursor for what&#39;s to come...

It&#39;s often said that to properly gauge a sushi bar&#39;s culinary acumen, one should first sample its Tamago (a sweetened omelet-like folded egg preparation). Then again, some people like to save this one for the end of their meal. Well, who am I to tell you when to have it? All I can say is it&#39;s delicious, so check it out. Other &#34;nigiri&#34; options you&#39;ll swoon over here include the Ono (or &#34;Super White Tuna&#34; as the menu calls it) and the you-can-taste-the-nutrition-in-the-crunch Wakame (seaweed) salad. On the roll side, the plump Futomaki will be a hit with vegetarians, as it contains Inari (fried tofu), Oshinko (pickled daikon radish), Yamagobo (burdock root), Kanpyo (shaved calabash), shiitake mushrooms, cucumber and avocado. The teriyaki beef/jalapeño and house special (tuna/spicy tuna/salmon/yellowtail/cucumber) rolls are great too - but I can&#39;t tell you about them all, so stop by and see for yourself."

Well long story short, I was not impressed despite of the high reviews. 

The atmosphere of the place is pretty quiet. It wasn&#39;t crowded, but it def had its share of people. The side seating is a bit cramped, but workable. Whereas the back is much more spacious. 

So it&#39;s $14.99 for AYCE lunch and don&#39;t forget the $2.50 for hot tea. Is it worth it for sushi? Sure. For the AYCE you get handed a sheet with appetizers, entrees, nigiri rolls, and rolls. 

Appetizers: we just got the miso soup (mediocre), edamame (just boiled and handed out), agedashi tofu (cold to taste and just battered and fried), and baked mussel (comes out hot and drenched in sauce) 
 
Entrees: chicken teriyaki (small frozen chicken patty thawed and drenched in sauce from what it tasted and looked like) and chicken katsu (nothing special, just a small piece of frozen chicken breaded and fried and sliced into small pieces). We also ordered the beef teriyaki, but that never showed. 

Nigiri: such small pieces. Think 1.5&#34; X1&#34; with a small piece of sashimi and a huge block of rice. Disappointed. It didn&#39;t taste all that fresh. 

Rolls: here is what you should get. Each roll comes with about 6-8 pieces and each piece is approximately the size of a quarter. So it gets pretty filling because of course there is rice in every piece. I have to say we ordered almost every roll. They end up kind of looking the same. Always a sliver of avocado and some kind of fish/crab meat. But super filling.

Service. They were here and there. They were relatively quick. They were also kind so that&#39;s always nice. Never felt rushed. 

I&#39;d definitely come back just for the rolls, but skip the entree."

The food speaks for itself.  I suggest going with the all you can eat deal at $25 a person.  Even though the nigiri is small, you can eat all you want for one low price.  You also get a complimentary Monkey Brains appetizer which is absolutely delicious.  

My friend and I both did AYCE and ordered the following x 2:

Ramen
Chicken teriyaki
Nigiri:  Shiro maguro, maguro, ono, tamago, tako, scallop, seared tuna
Gyoza
Xmas roll - tempura shrimp, cucumber topped with tuna, tai, avocado, tobiko
Totoro roll - deep fried spicy tuna, yellowtail, salmon, cucumber
Beef Lover&#39;s roll - beef teriyaki, jalapeno, cream cheese, deep fried
Shrimp tempura roll

Oishi!  The fish tasted fresh and came out in good time.  I didn&#39;t care much for the ramen broth, but the noodles were done perfectly.  The gyoza and chicken teriyaki both had really good flavor.  I wish I had room in my stomach to order mochi ice cream, but we barely finished what we ordered.  They charge $0.50 for each left over piece including rice, so make sure you only order what you can finish.

So I have to compare to Sushi Katsu on Havana BC that&#39;s our go to for AYCE sushi... With that said it is a completely different atmosphere. S-Katsu is bustling (sometimes line out the door) and the atmosphere is almost entertaining with tables too close together, waitresses running around and sushi chefs hollering in Japanese/Spanish. This however is not that. Super quiet and laid back atmosphere with absolutely no wait to get in.  Same price I believe for both places for lunch and dinner AYCE $15 for lunch and $25 for dinner. Same concept at both places where you order from what&#39;s on the paper menu and you have 3 pages of additional rolls to choose from on the regular menu. In have to say that S-Katsu has more app and side items than S-Totoro but the roll selection is pretty comparable. S-Totoro might actually have more selection of specialty rolls and they have a few with soft shell crab and I didn&#39;t remember that at S-Katsu.  Nice wait staff, food was good, we are full and would come back because it&#39;s right down the street from our house. S-Katsu has the edge though because of the atmosphere and awesome service. 

Side note that was an initial turn off was the hostess had really bad halitosis... So bad that everyone at our table noticed it and we overheard another table talking about it. I feel bad putting this on here but it was pretty extreme."

I did the $24.95 all you can eat dinner and while some of the unagi/fish on the nigiri was small, they had a great selection of apps, entrees, and during dinner you can add their Special Rolls to the all you can eat. 

A great selection of interesting rolls (Crunchy Scallop yum!, and the other roll (which I can&#39;t remember the name had tempura red snapper, shitake mushrooms, topped with unagi).

We didn&#39;t have a problem finding a seat. Almost everyone in there was asian, I think Japanese :) (always a good sign).  We ordered off the regular menu. I can&#39;t eat a ton of food so &#34;all you can eat&#34; usually doesn&#39;t benefit me-- I think that was a good decision because I had plenty of food!

The monkey brain roll (not real brains or monkey) was delicious, courtesy of the house. I would order it next time. My Mom had a box, which came with soup and all the fixins, she loved the spare ribs. I ordered the spicy tuna sunset roll. It was good but I actually preferred the monkey brains. We also had a vege roll for one of her side dishes. It was really good, refreshing. The ginger salad was as expected and the ginger tasted fresh. They didn&#39;t have the onion soup, that was the only disappointment, the miso was eh, miso. The waitress was attentive and adorable and it was clean and relaxing. I enjoyed it and look forward to trying other menu items!"

This is the second location coming off the heels of Sushi Train.  I came here on a whim last Saturday.  Funny thing is, there is another sushi restaurant across the street from here.  You can probably find the review somewhere in my list of reviews.  Let&#39;s get back to Sushi Tortoro.  The dining area is warm and inviting.  Bathrooms are clean and smell wonderful.  

The sushi bar doesn&#39;t feel as cozy as Sushi Train.  However, the functionality and quickness of service will give you that warm fuzzy feeling.  If you sit in the first 3 seats of the sushi bar, you will catch the breeze each time the door opens and cross your fingers no one farts on their way in.

Salad dressing is wonderful.  Miso soup could use a bit more miso next time.  Even the udon is ok.  The sushi chefs here are on point and professional.  You too can talk to them.  I&#39;ll have to get used to a couple new guys.  Waitstaff seemed a bit rushed as if they were understaffed.  Overall, a welcomed addition in the neighborhood and looking forward to making this the GO TO spot for sushi in this part of town!"

The service was ok but the food just wasn&#39;t worth it. We didn&#39;t do all you can eat and ordered a few rolls, nigiri, soup, and salad. The cucumber salad was sliced cucumber with lemon, no sauce or dressing like usual. The miso soup was ok but had a slight weird after taste. The nigiri was very dry and extremely small especially for paying full price. The rolls were fine but really just lacked any flavor. The spicy yellowtail roll was basically a yellowtail roll with sriracha on top. Do not order the house hot sake. It tasted like clay smells, very off putting.

It really just wasn&#39;t worth it for me. Oh and the soap in the bathroom is watered down dish soap."

The restaurant offers same concept that sushi katsu does. 14 dollars all you can eat lunch deal. I have been enjoying sushi katsu and finally tried totoro today for the first time due to one of my coworkers&#39; recommendation. They offer similar menus, but i would say quality is slightly better at totoro than katsu. Their salmon sushi is really good and loved their entrees such as pork katsu and seafood dynamite. Customer service was average. Not bad, but not outstanding either. Another good thing about this place is you don&#39;t have to wait unlikr katsu since not a lot of local customers are aware of this place yet. Anyway, sorry to sushi katsu because i will be going to this place from now on!"

The spicy tuna and monkey brains were awesome!  Also had a rainbow roll and chicken skewers.

Of course I had to visit. The decor is nicely done with Totoro hanging out with you while you eat your sushi. They even have Totoro on their chopstick wrapper. However, I think it is still a work in progress. Our server was very attentive and answered any questions we had about the menu. 

They started off with a complimentary appetizer with deep fried avocado and crab, It was light and very good for a starter. We ended up ordering the ramen (just to try it since I have been on the hunt for a nearby ramen place) miso soup, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, spicy and non spicy scallop(spicy scallop has a dollop of siracha), tuna, white tuna, super white tuna,fish roe, country roll, rainbow roll, and totoro roll. I was very impressed by their scallops, they were very smooth with a hint of sweetness and overall tasted very good. Otherwise I really liked the tuna , totoro roll and rainbow roll. The other stuff I can&#39;t really bring myself to order again. 

This isn&#39;t a horrible place considering it was all you can eat, and I think I would come back to try some of their other specialty rolls. If you&#39;re itching for really good overall nigiri or sashemi, I don&#39;t know that I could recommend this place for that though."

When we walked in we were greeted by several of the sushi chefs as well as the hostess. We were seated promptly and told about the all-you-can-eat sushi option, which we chose to do (we love sushi). Our server brought out the monkey brains appetizer to try since it was our first time there - a very kind gesture and nice surprise. While we waited for our first round of sushi rolls we took in the great ambiance and the cute images and illustrations of Totoro. It was pretty quiet and wasn&#39;t crowded that night, which I very much enjoyed. All the sushi rolls we ordered were amazing and delicious (unfortunately I don&#39;t remember the names of them). The service we received was excellent - some of the best we&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant.

Sushi Totoro has become a new favorite of ours and we will definitely be going back the next time we have a craving for sushi. :)"

I literally ate the food here to fast to take pictures of it. When I come back again I will gain self control and have some pictures of this delicious food. It looked so good and tasted so incredible but...

If you go in for the standard sushi fair you will probably be disappointed. My recommendation is to go for the all you can eat to get a sampling of everything that interests you. The Nuggets specialty roll was dope. It was like a drug that I  literally couldn&#39;t get enough of. The fried jalapeños , mushroom balls, Futo rolls, and New York rolls were also delicious buy less addictive. They also have a decent drink selection here so try out the Karatamba dry saki they have. 

On the flip side, the place was pretty empty so I don&#39;t think it would be a great first date spot. This seems like a good spot to chill with friends, family, and just large groups in general. Some of the nigiri I had like the plain shrimp roll weren&#39;t great. The meat on them was dry like it had been sitting out on a counter all day. Keep in mind these terrible rolls consisted of 1/16th of my actual meal so it didn&#39;t affect the overall score much. Pro tip: Stick to the specialty rolls for flavor and sit near the bar.  Food comes faster that way and those chiefs just might serve as your wingmen in a pitch."

Attentive and happy looking unlike the other server that was around. She didn&#39;t look pissed or anything ahaha just not as chippery.

The ambiance is still in the works it seems but I think if the restaurant gets filled a little more, it would look much better. The Totoro art is soooooooooooooo adorable, but once again, seems like a big empty space in the back that makes it seem incomplete.


The food was mediocre. I wouldn&#39;t say it is better than Sushi Katsu. The set up of their hot green tea is great! Their apps were okay....the dynamite was terrible. Imagine a bowl of mayo, barely any seafood, with some sriracha and baked. My boyfriend was fishing for the seafood and could barely find any and the ones he found were as small as ants. I saw the table next to us keep ordering gyoza so that must have been decent. The udon at Sushi Katsu is more temperature hot, which I prefer but would be willing to try it here again. The sushi was ok. The sushi rice seemed accurate but some of their sashimi pieces were cut in a very unappetizing manner and with varying levels of thickness. Some were so thin and poorly cut, it didn&#39;t look appetizing enough for me to even want to try and consume it.

Might return to try their bentos maybe since it&#39;s so close to my boyfriend&#39;s place."

The staff are all very friendly and they are all Japanese, which seem to be a good thing for a sushi place (and the Chefs are all really cute xD) I forgot my wallet there and later realize and the staff kept it for me with everything still intact, so great staff. 

All the non sushi food items food were delicious, but one noticeable thing is that their nigiri are so much smaller than other sushi place. It cute and bit size, but I feel like the favor isn&#39;t as good as other place I been, but it not horrible. The only thing I have problem with is that any nigiri with the word &#34;spicy&#34; in it name, their just put sriracha on it! and not actually use other spice. I think that the only downside, but definitely will comeback again, just will avoid the &#34;spicy&#34; stuff. 

I went there and they are offering &#34;Monkey brain&#34; as part of their promotion and that was one of their best dish would definitely recommend."

The reason for retaining 2 stars is because their wait staff is deplorable. I&#39;m always greeted by the sushi makers, rarely the hostess or waiters. The waiters don&#39;t seem interested in working or doing anything other than talking to each other. I waited almost 20 minutes on a Wednesday after noon until I asked them if theyd take my order. Absolutely ridiculous service. I&#39;ve come here enough to know that it&#39;s not a one time screw up and also to know their fish is consistently good. Do pickup, don&#39;t dine in.

They have a couple of murals on the wall which are cute and fun to see. The menu, menu items, decorations, and even the chopstick casing had Totoro themes. 

Went there for the all you can eat sushi and they have quite a big selection of sushi, nigiri, and appetizers to make the price worth it. 

As for the food, I was a little disappointed. The miso soup was lacking flavor. They put an odd lemony sauce on a few of the sushi&#39;s and nigiri that wasn&#39;t too appetizing. We received a complimentary &#34;monkey brain&#34; appetizer which was pretty good! The fish wasn&#39;t as good as I&#39;ve found else where in Denver. Even other all you can sushi places near by, would be considered better quality than this one. After not being too impressed with the items I got, I sadly didn&#39;t go and try the Totoro sushi roll. 

The novelty of the restaurant was fun enough to go once, even if the food isn&#39;t that great. They were oddly playing sports on the tv on the restaurant. It&#39;s understandable, but just an odd choice for a themed restaurant. 

I probably won&#39;t be returning, but happy that I went and tried it out."

They have all the nigiri you would expect, and a variety of rolls that kept the meal interesting.  The Totoro roll was exquisite, of course with deep fried spicy tuna, yellowtail, and salmon, how can you go wrong?  The seafood dynamite was...well dynamite.  This, plus an awesome beer selection made for a fantastic experience.  

The restaurant itself was pristine.  The artwork on the walls adds to the fun environment, and the service was alarmingly pleasant and prompt.  I am accustomed to waiting for some time between ordering sushi, and it being delivered (sorry Sushi Katsu), but speed and efficiency seem to be of the utmost importance here...or was it the customer service?  Either way, they excel in both areas.  The wait staff was on the prowl for anyone without food and drink on the table at all times, and was quick to offer suggestions as to what was best on the menu.  I will be back, often."

The Totoro theme, especially the fun mural on the wall at the back of the restaurant, is unique and adds a nostalgic feel for the classic animated character. 

I stopped by for the lunch menu with a group of friends and found that the $14.99 price for a variety of nigiri, rolls, and appetizers was incredible. There is a charge for every piece that isn&#39;t eaten, so some pre-planning with your table may be required if you don&#39;t want to end up with a larger bill than you want. 

Despite the incredible price and a decent selection of menu items, the food ultimately was sub-par to my expectations. Miso soup is one of my favorites, but I found the tofu a bit gritty and the soup watered down. Most of the nigiri was tasty, such as the salmon and eel, but a lemon-y sauce on some of the others such as the white tuna overpowered the flavor of the fish. The rolls ended up being my favorite out of everything we ordered. 

The staff is attentive and quick, which did make my experience here enjoyable. I&#39;m glad that I got to try this place out and would definitely recommend the atmosphere."

First off, the ambience - Anyone who has seen the iconic Studio Ghibli flick will recognize the name of the restaurant, and it&#39;s not limited to just the sign outside. The fluffy creature features on every available surface inside, from murals to chopstick packets, and there are also a number of cute wall scrolls and beautifully framed images from the film. Definitely a treat for anyone who likes Totoro.

The place is well-lit, clean, and quiet. The staff was helpful and attentive - we didn&#39;t have to wait for drink refills, and they roll out your sushi and appetizer orders as they&#39;re ready so we didn&#39;t wait long to start eating (and keep eating) once we&#39;d ordered.

Probably my biggest point in favor of their setup, though, is everything you get for the $15 (lunch) or $25 (dinner) you spend. Unlike a lot of other places, they make all their rolls available for all-you-can-eat, including the often-pricey specialty ones. In addition to that, all the APPETIZERS are also included - and they are some fantastic appetizers! We ate the standard miso soup and edamame, but also indulged in some tempura-fried jalapeno poppers, crab and avocado bites, and probably the second-best egg rolls I&#39;ve ever had. All included in the price. Needless to say, if you can put away a fair amount of sushi and apps (I can) you&#39;ll get more than your money&#39;s worth out of the price.

Absolutely will be going here as often as I can afford it."

There are totoro paintings on the wall, totoro cartoon characters on the menu &amp; chopsticks, and waiters wear totoro t-shirts. It&#39;s cute overload. Is that even legal? The place is modern, spacious and clean inside. It was much larger than I expected. It seems that they even have a private room area out back (which doesn&#39;t appear to be set up yet). They have an all you can eat lunch special for $15 (pretty freaking cheap!) &amp; they charge $0.50 for excessive leftover foods. Waiters were really attentive. The female waitress was super friendly, cheerful and sweet. She made sure to seat customers in spots that avoided the glare from the window and she was very sweet when cautioning me to not touch the hot plate. The male waiter brought out a complimentary 4 piece fried sushi roll called monkey brains that had imitation crab and avocado. It was very good. I opted for the AYCE and got fried jalapenos, agedashi tofu, seafood dynamite and some spicy tuna sushi rolls. My least favorite dish was the seafood dynamite because I was not sure how to eat it. It seemed like a bunch of mayo sauce with some seafood in it and it seemed like it should be served on top of a roll or with rice or something. It was too overwhelmingly rich for me. I liked the jalapenos because they were too hot (both in temperature and spiciness). The agedashi tofu came with a citrus sauce (maybe ponzu?).  I wish I had more stomach space to try more from their menu.

Also kudos for them playing pink noon by 1 of my favorite artists Nick Drake."

There are a wider variety of items on this menu than other places like Sushi Katsu, which I like a lot.

The ramen option on the AYCE menu was okay. For AYCE, the ramen was a great item to add a little variety. Its flavor was on the okay side and the bamboo was actually overcooked so it was a little deformed and chewy.

The gyoza were nice and crispy and full of meat, but the sauce is pretty mediocre.

The nigiri were small pieces of fish on large slabs of mushy rice. The mushy rice overpowered the flavor of the fish, so both the portion sizes and flavors were disappointing.

We got several sushi rolls as well. However, the sushi rice was very mushy and there was a good amount of it in each roll, so a lot of the rolls tasted basically the same. Some of the rolls had hints of nice flavors in them, but the large amount of mushy rice in all of them just had me gagging and struggling to force it down my throat to avoid the extra charges."

The restaurant is cutely decorated with murals of Totoro characters and the lay out from my understanding is typical of Japanese restaurants in Japan. The staff are very friendly and it&#39;s very clean. Simon and I have been there a number of times and each time the service has been constant and the food always delicious.

Sushi Totoro is a All You Can Eat sushi place. They do offer individual plates for ordering but why go to a All You Can Eat sushi place and not get all you can eat? Lunches are $14.99 and dinners are $24.95. We feel this is pretty fair considering that it&#39;s ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!

They start you off with complementary Monkey Brains. Before you freak out, it&#39;s not real monkey brains. It&#39;s avocado with crab meat and maybe something else, fried in tempera. I&#39;m not a avocado person. I will pull it off of anything that I get. However, the way they cook this makes it to where I don&#39;t get the avocado taste. You have the crunch of the tempera and then the soft  inside that almost melts inside your mouth, combined with some kind of wonderful sauce. This was good to munch on while we went over the menu. If you want more, you can order it off of the regular menu and pay extra for it.

The All You Can Eat menu is broken down into sections nicely. You have the appetizers, entrees and the sushi. We went for Miso Soup, Tofu Salad and the Chicken Yakitori from the appetizer list. The Miso was spot on and I have to say, one of the best Miso Soups I&#39;ve found in Aurora. Simon had the Tofu Salad and said that it isn&#39;t really anything to write home about. It&#39;s chunks of tofu with iceberg lettuce, carrot, onion and the normal ginger salad dressing. The Chicken Yakitori is really just a chicken kabob with bell peppers and onions. The sauce we think is teriyaki with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. It was okay but the chicken was dry. This wasn&#39;t one of Simon&#39;s favorite dishes.

For our entrees, we picked Beef Teriyaki and Yakisoba Noodles. Next to the sushi, these two dishes were our favorites. The beef is thin cut, like the kind that you would see in Bulgogi, which brings out the flavors of the sauces. There is something about thin cut beef that make a dish ten times better. The Yakisoba Noodles were perfectly cooked. 

Then there was the sushi. I&#39;m very limited to what kind of sushi I can eat. I admit that I have a issue with textures of food. I always get Tamago, you can never go wrong with egg and rice. I did try it with the seaweed wrapped around it but my teeth have a hard time biting and chewing up seaweed, so I have to take it off. I also order the Kani (Crab Meat). Simon orders all of the other stuff. This time he got Unagi, Salmon, Tuna, Spicy Scaloop, Ocotopus, Flying Fish Roe, and Spicy Crab Rolls. The sushi is the best that we&#39;ve had in the area and for being in a land locked state. The fish is fresh and not slimy. 

They have so many other options for you to choose from and the best part of this is, it&#39;s ALL YOU CAN EAT! So if want to sample everything and then order more of your favorite, you can! Everything that we ordered, is on the All You Can Eat menu. Note, if you want just rice with your meal, you aren&#39;t going to get any. It&#39;s a shame as I love rice and the Beef Teriyaki would be awesome with some.

If you enjoy sushi and drinks, this is the place for you. There is a kids menu. They will charge $.50 for any left over sushi, so make sure you order only what you can eat. They offer take out and catering. They also have a full bar for those that want drinks."
sushi-totoro-aurora,Andy W.,VgohpzUFwRIjaRjxRpMfgw,"Aurora, CO",0,1,0,0,5,IsTP6CF8TExP-rJASzBLvg,1.0,2016-01-01,"I like sushi and was excited about a new all you can eat sushi place near our neighborhood.  Unfortunately it was a major disappointment.  First, the food was well below average for what we paid.   I make attempt to make sushi at home and my own stuff tasted better than what we were served.  Rice was warm.  It was probably hot when they rolled it as the rest of the items in the rolls ended up luke warm as well.

Second is the sticker shock of the price.  $25 for dinner and $14 for lunch is high even for all you can eat.  I would rather go to Hiro about 10 minutes down the road where the prices are $15 for dinner and $9 for lunch. I was willing to give it a shot once because it was newer and we love sushi.  They either need to greatly increase their quality to go along with the price or lower their price to match the quality.

We won&#39;t be back and won&#39;t encourage others to go either.  I believe the amount they charge for the quality will be their undoing."

Very friendly staff and incredible selection. 

Our server provided complimentary hot green tea and monkey brain appetizer. 

We tried the dinner combo and the value is spot on for what you get. Chicken Katsu isn&#39;t overly breaded with a successful sauce compliment. Tempura vegetables are light, crunchy and satisfying. Miso soup is standard but well executed. 

Rolls vary from pedestrian to tantalizingly exciting! There are far too many to recommend, so any choice is a guaranteed hit. Speak to the gentlemen behind the bar for a pleasant conversation to go with a meal.

Will continue to frequent!"

The sushi is very bland.  I honestly feel it&#39;s kinda a stretch to even call it sushi... everything they have is a variation on the california roll... BORING!

I also ordered the pork ramen and I&#39;m pretty sure they just used instant ramen and added some pickled veggies and a boiled egg to make it &#34;authentic&#34;.  The noodles were super mushy and the broth was just meh.

Also, my server (who was white and most definitely not Japanese) decided to lecture us on Japanese etiquette.  

I feel like this was some weeaboo&#39;s half-hearted attempt at Japanese food.  If you want to try out Japanese food, please for the love of all things good in this world, go somewhere else."

My roommate raved about this place, and finally we took the 45 min drive out for the $25 all you can eat sushi. The monkey brain appetizer is just a must order, as are the fried stuffed jalapeños. I have tried multiple rolls and have never been disappointed, but I typically stick to Nigiri - the seared albacore comes with a nice tatami sauce, the yellowtail is always fresh and light, and the super white tuna (escolar...?) just falls apart in your mouth. The sushi would be amazing even without such a bargain for all you can eat, but come HUNGRY and order a little at a time because they charge you for anything you don&#39;t finish!"

As a self-professed anime nerd with a great fondness for the works of Miyazaki, I was of course very excited to check out a new local business with what I assumed would be the same type of quality I was used to from Sushi Train. 
Well, they kind of missed the mark here. A few Totoro prints dotted the place, but otherwise it was pretty uninspired decor-wise. The sushi chefs were, however, quick to keep up with the orders and the food was decent for all you can eat. 
Essentially the menu is the same as ST, with few exceptions. We tried a few rolls we had ordered at their sister location and several pieces of nigiri. The fish was pretty dry and the rice was soggy, not at all like what I have come to expect at their other location. 
But what made the whole experience borderline unappealing was the wait staff. The young lady who was waiting (less than three) tables obviously didn&#39;t care and was more interested in chatting up the chefs at the bar. 
Long after we were clearly done, we waited for our check, looking over to where she was busy chatting with the other employees several times and attempting to flag her down. The service at ST has never been failed to be less than excellent so this was really disappointing. 
Really hope they can hit their stride with upping the ante at this place in terms of both quality of food and service, because they already have a successful business in Sushi Train that they know how to make work. I&#39;ll give them a few more months to hit their stride and check back in later!"

Coming from Las Vegas, which has numerous AYCE places, I was eager to try what Colorado has to offer. First off, there was a very strange smell in the restaurant. Like backed up sewage or something. That should have been my first clue, but alas, we stayed. I did the AYCE lunch. I was very surprised because the menu was not their typical menu. It was extremely limited with what sushi you could get. I ordered a few rolls and they were just ok. Nothing seemed overly cold or fresh. I also ordered several pieces of salmon, tuna, and octopus nigiri. These as well, weren&#39;t overly cold and they were TINY!!! I know it is AYCE, but still, give me a piece larger than a quarter please. The salmon and octopus were good, but the tuna had a strange taste to it. They other thing I found interesting was that all the fish for the nigiri was pre sliced and kept in a big was at the front of the sushi bar. Less than appetizing.... I won&#39;t be returning to this place. I&#39;m sure Denver has way better options."

The reason for the 4 out of 5 instead of 5 out of 5 s because while the quality is good for the Denver area, I am originally from the Northeast,  and so far, nothing around here compares to what I can get in NYC, New England,  or Maryland,. But, it&#39;s great for Denver."

Everyone in my party agreed to try the all you can eat sushi for $25 (per person) and boy was it well worth it!!!  While the rolls in the pictures look remarkably similar, the tastes between each of them are vastly different and unbelievably delicious.  My favorites were the Rockies Roll, which had a kick to it, the Broncos Roll, and the Star Wars Roll.  The rolls itself were well made and held together.  The Sushi Chefs are clearly experienced in this art form. The sushi rice had to have been freshly made using traditional style as opposed to a vinegar powder most commonly used in restaurants, as there was a consistent taste in each bite and roll. The staff was very friendly...our server was very attentive, but not annoyingly so.  She was very observant when it came to removing/replacing dishes as well as refilling our beverages and provided us a free appetizer of &#34;Monkey Brain Roll&#34; which was very light and delicious. The environment is a fast casual concept, where tank tops and shorts would be acceptable during the summer months.  I would say that this place isn&#39;t quite appropriate for young children due to the menu offerings.  Sorry folks!...you won&#39;t find chicken nuggets here (thank goodness)!  The only advice I could give when ordering the all you can eat special, is to skip anything that will likely fill you up (beverages, miso soup, edamame, etc etc) as any uneaten piece of sushi results in being charged $.50 per piece.  So come hungry and only order what you know you can finish!  Each specialty roll is approximately 6-8 pieces of good size and the smaller, more basic rolls are the same, but with one or two simple ingredients.  The average hungry adult can usually consume 3 types of rolls, so keep this in mind when ordering. The place is relatively new, so I hope the owners will do well to maintain the level of service and quality of food over time.  Located in a very busy and small strip mall, parking can be somewhat difficult.  This place is definitely my new sushi hot spot despite it not being run by Japanese owners/ personnel (they are Korean and Chinese for those curious in knowing)."

I went in with low expectations and Sushi Totoro impressed me. I Tried a variery of rolls plus the Seafood Dynamite. The only negative experience i had was that their rice doesnt hold together as well as other places ive been to like Mt. Fuji or Sushi Katsu.I lost some rice in my soy sauce/wasabi bowl because the rice wasnt sticky enough, but it wasnt too bad. Still worth the trip and overall happy with my experience :)"

I need to rethink what happens and let my blood simmer down a bit - just to make sure that I am being far in my review.

I am being fair with my review.

First off - I walked in and there was nobody there to greet me. I wanted to order a carryout and I walked to the bar where there were a bunch of dirty plates and glasses everywhere.  The owner (I believe) came out.  And I have to say he was the dirtiest man I have ever seen to work in a restaurant. He spit when he talked...he was just unpleasant.

Now I am all about hole in the wall places and that is usually where the best food comes from, so I decided to proceed with my order.  I then showed him the 10% off that the Yelp app offered for his establishment.  He went on a tirade about how he will not accept it, since why would he give out free food for $3000 a year.  He has asked Yelp to take that discount off the app for over 3 years...yada yada yada.  I felt very uncomfortable after...and I took my food and left.

The food was so-so.  My spanakopita was not flaky - in fact part of the crust was hard.  The grape leaves were pretty good though.

I will not be back"

- The saganaki came out flaming and had a nice crunch and aftertaste to it
- The grilled octopus had that nice grilled flavor to it and went nicely with the olive oil.  Not the best octopus (it was more fishy than steaky), but we are very far away from the ocean
- The lamb kebob was very tender.  Could have used a little more flavor
- Service was ok.  Only one server for a packed house made it a little chaotic, but it could have been much worse"

The honey and nuts were infused with sweet spices and this was all held between flaky, tender, buttery layer after layer of phyllo dough.  This is real Greek food; not food that says it is Greek, but really only adds a couple of crumbles of Feta and/or some olives and calls itself &#34;Greek.&#34;  And, this is coming from a half-Greek person.

The gyro was hot and pretty decent.  Fair amount of meat, but only fair.  My favorite gyros have meat busting out of the pita, the kind where you can barely grip it to eat it.  This wasn&#39;t one of those.  

The seasoned fries were also very hot and well seasoned.

At first, I thought they were just very attentive... they were definitely flirty, but it wasn&#39;t a big deal. But the last time I went there, I was picking up a to go order (the only time I&#39;ve gone there alone). While waiting, the owner asked me if I was married. Then he asked me about the race of my husband (I&#39;m brown... it&#39;s a weird question, but I actually get it pretty often), and THEN he asked me if I had heard about the Kama Sutra. Yup. You read that correctly. The aged owner of the restaurant where I was purchasing food asked me how familiar I was with the Kama Sutra. And then proceeded to tell me how he thinks my husband would appreciate it. 

Bizzare.

I felt SO uncomfortable that I am literally NEVER going back there. I thought I would let other know about this somewhat &#34;predatory&#34; man. I&#39;m sure if you go in a group, it&#39;s not a big deal. Otherwise, prepare yourself to get sexually harassed..."

Today, Saturday 8/29 I went to this restaurant for lunch. I will address food, facility and service.  First, food... Let me say that the hummus taste is OK, nothing special, expensive for the small plate you receive, and you receive like 7 or 8 pita slices to eat the hummus, I asked for more pita only to find out its $1.25 for more. The fried zucchini is not good, and the garlic mash with the zucchini is even worse.  The Greek Giro platter offers lamb and beef, could not tell what which was which, but to make it worse, I found hard, bone like elements in the meat. Like other reviewers, it seemed like the portion was small for the price.  The small Greek salad was the best thing we had to eat.   Second, the facility, I went inside but decided to eat outside for two reasons, first it was nice out, second, the benches looked old and worn.  I did not sit in them so they may be fine, but they certainly looked worn.  Once outside, I had to ask for the cigarette ash trays to be moved as I could smell old cigarette butts. There were at least 6 dirty ashtrays sitting in the outdoor area and they stunk.  About half the patio is set, the over half the outside area is used as storage for tables that seemed to have no tops, and chairs that are not being used.  Third, the server did a great job taking our order, keeping our water glasses full and serving us food.  
I was very disappointed, I was told by a friend this place was really good.  I read reviews on this site that would say the same.  Maybe I caught them at a bad time or a bad day.
I do no like to write bad reviews, but in this case, with all the great things said about this place, I wanted to bring another view to the opinions.
I would tell the owners they should pay attention to details, because it certainly feels to me that this place has gone DOWN HILL!"

The gyro plate comes with a soup or salad. I elected to go with a salad. The greens were overdressed and some of the greens were very dark as if the greens were tossed earlier and not to order.

The gyro meat itself was good. It&#39;s what you&#39;d expect a gyro to be: slices of spiced tender lamb meat served with a pita and creamy tzatziki sauce.

The baklava was very rich. It was my first time having baklava so I had nothing to compare it with. It seemed to have a lot of honey on it but it was good."

Because of the location, I figured this was going to be a chill restaurant to go to with my friend, but it was this actual bar atmosphere.

The Saganaki is made with a harder cheese than usual and has a wonderful texture!  The Spinakopita is downright the best i&#39;ve ever eaten!  The calamari were perfectly cooked.  The pita&#39;s were of very nice quality.  The other items were pretty good too.  For the main meal we shared a chicken kebab plate.  The chicken was very juicy and nicely cooked.  The rice was very nice and the green beans/snow peas(?) came with a greek &#34;hollandaise &#34; type of sauce.  We even managed to save some room for a bite of desert.  We tried their Baklava and Milk Custard.  The Baklava has lots of nutty layers for you to enjoy (though i wish there was a little more of the crispy phyllo layers on top).  We&#39;ve never had the milk custard before, but it was very yummy!

Highly recommended.

UPDATE:  We keep coming back here and the food quality is still great!  The galaktoboureko (custard dessert) is insanely addictive! :D"

The Tyrokafteri (spicy feta cheese dip served with pita bread) is good enough to make this place a destination by itself.   I only tried that, a Greek Salad with Souvlaki and a side Souvlaki Kalamaki (skewer of traditional pork marinated with Greek spices) and absolutely everything was really nice.

I was there for lunch, but upon walking out, I noticed their sign said &#34;Steakhouse&#34;, so I inquired.  They claimed their Colorado Lamb and Rib Eye (the sauce has apparently been 12 years in the making) are second to none.  I will be heading back to verify, as there is no doubt they truly care about the quality of their food.

A must-try."

I did takeout*, but spent a little time chatting with the very pleasant owner(s) while I waited for my food (I did not call ahead).  Energetic big band type music playing and everything looked really clean.  Layout is a bit off to me, but plenty of seating.  And they have an outstanding patio space!!  Seriously, really nice with good seating, away from the street and kind of secluded by trees, etc.  I&#39;m going to go back, just to enjoy lunch on that patio.

Now, the food.  I ordered one of  their specials which was a small Greek salad with choice of meat ($9.95), I went gyros.  The meat was fantastic!  Great flavor, not dry and perfectly charred around the edges .  I would have liked a bit more on my salad though.  My favorite part of the salad was the feta.  The absolute best feta I have ever had!!  And I have eaten at many a Greek restaurant, though sadly never in Greece.  I will go back just for that feta!  The salad as a whole was fresh and had a nice, light dressing, though I would have liked a bit more lettuce but I guess they mean small when they say small.  It was served with a warm, perfectly toasted and deliciously soft pita that helped fill me up.  And the tzatziki was great!  Some of the best tzatziki I&#39;ve ever had as well.

Summary: amazing feta, great gyros meat, flavorful tzatziki and a fantastic patio.

All in all, I will be back.

*I had to mention that I found it quite amusing that my takeout box said &#34;Muchos Gracias&#34; on it.  I&#39;m hoping they got it on sale from a Mexican restaurant going out of business!?"

I&#39;m guessing it is new since I never noticed it before, but not sure because the booths are all torn up, there is a stale smoke smell to it, and the pictures are hung up with push pins.  The menu has very few options because 1/2 of them were simple American dishes like hamburgers and chicken sandwiches, which is not why I go to a Greek restaurant.  I had the &#39;Poor Boy Sampler&#39; and the chicken was just ok, the gyro meat was good, and the fries were soggy.  It came with the Avgolemeno soup, which was very bland.  Walked out giving a small tip and totaling just under $20!  
Why the small tip?...I felt like the owners were a bit creepy with the younger women dining there at the time.  Very strange and maybe even something to be concerned about more than I am right now.  Oddly enough I read some of these reviews and it appears I am not the only one noticing that.  
This is not a Greenwood Village restaurant, but rather something you would find in a sketchy neighborhood strip mall in Aurora.  
Sahara Restaurant is just up the street from this, and the owners are classy, and the food is fantastic.  Trust me, its a no-brainer if your comparing the two."

The owner himself served us and told us how he makes everything. It takes him 3 hours just for the baklava. We went with gyros since it was lunch and the pita was amazing.

I turns out that was them as well. I used to eat there 30 years ago when they were picked Best Greek Food by Westword.

Now they are out south here, and a welcome addition to the south suburbs. Every other &#34;greek&#34; restaurant I&#39;ve tried out here thinks that Gyros should be pulled out of a drawer, warmed up and served. What a difference it makes to cut it off the cone. 

I&#39;ve been back several times and gotten to know the family. They always ask about my wife and grandchild if they are not with me.

Greek food is dear to me.  I have eaten at so many fine Greek restaurants (especially the Parthenon in Chicago) that I seek them out.  

Living in Denver, there is not much to see.  I love Yanni&#39;s, it&#39;s my go-to.  But &#34;Greek to Me&#34; is close to my house so I decided to try it.  Again, it&#39;s close to my house.

I&#39;m sorry Yanni.

First off, the Avgolemono soup was horrible.  As my wife said, &#34;they should be embarrassed&#34;.  We make it at home and know its not &#34;Greek&#34;, but so much better than from here.

Next, my gyro was average, nothing special.

My wife&#39;s chicken, dry and expensive.

Not going back, will drive the extra mile or two to Yanni&#39;s and spend the extra $3-6 dollars there.  Much worth it.

Again, sorry Yanni.  I don&#39;t know how this place is receiving great reviews.  The food had no taste.  My wife and I could have made the same meal, but better, at our house.  This is not why I go out to eat, especially at ethnic restaurants.  I want to eat something I CAN&#34;T make at home, or if I can, you can do it better."

Our son&#39;s &#34;hamburger&#34; was resembled a small, black Frisbee and was hard and weird (for lack of a better word).  The pita bread was decent but the hummus was just okay.  When our entrees came, it didn&#39;t get any better.  My salmon was very dry and the rice had no flavor and was a strange consistency.  My husband&#39;s gyros were lacking in flavor as well.  We left and were so disappointed about the quality of the food.  I really wish it had been better as the hostess/waitress was so nice.

Only two tables were occupied, but a decent setting. Very clean and nice smelling with an awesome sound system playing classic smooth jazzy tunes. We were met by a nice lady with messy, frizzy, long blonde hair and told we could sit anywhere we wanted. Drinks ordered and inexpensive paper menus were handed to us, mine with food stains on it. A man rushes in from the front door carrying bags of groceries, goes towards the back kitchen then returns to bring our drinks. His name is Gino and he owns the place. For appetizers I wanted the flaming cheese but hubby wanted octopus. Gino swears that I will love octopus. Ok, we get it. I hate it, it&#39;s hard and rubbery. So I get my delicious cheese served with the most delectable pita bread I have EVER had. Fresh and hot and melts in your mouth YUM! We have an amazing shiraz wine with dinner and then Gino comes over with a bottle of ouzo and four shot glasses. We drink to each other and say OPA! Wonderful. Food is not the quickest out of the kitchen, but it is very good and well-seasoned. I had gyros, hubby had lamb kabob, friends had souvlaki salad and gyros. Good food, good friends, great music and shots of ouzo and whiskey made for a very pleasant evening. 
  My suggestion; tame the frizzy hair woman to look more polished. 
Tenderize the octopus meat and don&#39;t over cook it. Invest in quality menus. Consult with an interior decorator to refine the small space. Additional waitstaff wouldn&#39;t hurt either as it was a little chaotic with only two people running around the whole place. Just a few little improvements and I&#39;m sure this place will be packed all the time. We will return."

Finally the owner came over and suggested I try his baklava. I&#39;m not usually a fan -- most times it&#39;s dripping with honey and sickeningly sweet. Not this time. It&#39;s full of nuts and cinnamon, just the right amount of sweetness. Easily the best baklava I&#39;ve ever eaten anywhere."

We ordered 2 orders of the monkey bread for the table.  The monkey bread says it comes with caramel and nutella cream cheese.  Usually, monkey bread has a lot of caramel in it/on it.  There was no caramel, I asked our server if it was supposed to have any and he said no.  I showed him the menu and he said the caramel is infused into the cream cheese.  That seemed unlikely but whatever.  The bread was very very dry even with the little bit of nutella cream cheese on top of it.

I ordered the avocado toast with 2 eggs.  The whole thing just lacked flavor and I ended up putting salt and hot sauce on it to bring out a little flavor.  The avo-toast was pretty small. 

The bingo brunch - they should really make their &#34;prizes&#34; more even across the board.  The bingo guy was saying at the beginning they&#39;d be giving out gift cards and bottles of champagne.  My prize was a paper bag with 3 dollar store pregnancy/ovulation tests inside. The person before me won a bottle of champagne.  Wtf?"

I&#39;ve heard so much about The Squeaky Bean and was really looking forward to dining here. Problem with a lot of these places featured on the Denver Dining Book is they only offer brunch on the weekends. I don&#39;t mind brunches per se, just wish they&#39;d still offer the regular breakfast/lunch items.

Anyway I scanned the brunch menu and picked the two items that I thought sounded a little unusual: Chorizo Scramble (house-made chorizo / eggs / potatoes / cheddar / avocado toast) and Pork Hash (brussels / pickled chiles / poached eggs). They both had that farm-to-table feel and surprising carry what&#39;s important to a lot of Chinese: Wok Hei (from Google - Wok Hei is the &#34;essense&#34; imparted by the wok when stir-frying over very high heat. The characteristic flavor is due to the the Maillard reactions and the charring of the ingredients)

I started out really enjoying the plates (we were sharing) but my dining companion wasn&#39;t all that into either. She said they tasted very similar and it was average to her. Needless to say, my mood was affected by that.

Hope readers won&#39;t be discouraged by my 3.5 star rating (I had to stick to my gut feeling when it comes to rating). I encourage everyone to try The Squeaky Bean!"

This place was a lot of fun (we arrived in time for Bingo (yes real old fashioned bingo where they give you bottles of champagne, coupons and bagged gifts for prizes).  We played a few rounds at our table - and one of our party won a bottle of prosecco.

Good noise levels for table conversation - even with bingo.

All the dishes had fresh vegetable ingredients and  were well played - the Wagyu beef and egg was exceptional - fired egg was cooked to perfection.  We tried a jug of the Bloody Mary drink when we arrived - this is quite spicy.

Wait service  was a bit slow - but don&#39;t think our waiter wanted to interfere with the bingo.   

Mobile app for this place is terrific and tells the story of the place and the team running it.  They should figure out how to connect that with the decor and menus once you are inside."

The pork chop was among the best I have ever had.  I never would have thought to put beets and watermelon together in a salad.   My co-worker said it was amazing.

I&#39;ll visit their bar one day soon. It looked awesome. The food wasn&#39;t something I am looking forward to again. 

My dish was the Rice and Beans. With minute amount of meat that was so tiny and so few I had to search for it in that dark sauce. My rice was still somewhat raw. Not all of them but it&#39;s noticeable. Whatever that was in my plate was good tho. That was the silver lining. I think they just need to improve on the portion and the presentation. Even with the fried egg on top it was still very sad looking. Add to that a big space on my plate where it looked like something was supposed to be there. 

The best silver lining ever for this visit? I got to play bingo. Its my first time. It&#39;s every Saturday and Sunday. The guy running the event yesterday was a very funny man. He turned the restaurant into a very weird but fun place. Imagine going to a library and as soon as that guy walks in; the library turns into a frat house! His choice of words were hilarious!

wagyu beef tartare - came in 2 portions. My husband loved his portion. Mine was way too salty. My husband tried mine and agreed that somehow all the salt ended on my portion. 

asparagus and egg - this was refreshing and interesting. The asparagus itself was still on the saltier side (not sure if the salt just carried over on my utensil from eating the tartare that was served at the same time), so the egg helped. 

sheep milk gnocchi - this was really good and came with 4 large gnocchi. Each gnocchi was the size of like 3 regular sized gnocchi. 

duck bacon - this was my favorite appetizer. I don&#39;t see this listed on their online menu. It came with some sort of sweet mustard that went really well with the salty bacon. 

pork chop entree - delicious! Would recommend. 
halibut entree - also delicious! Would recommend.

cheesecake - this came in a jar with marmalade. Didn&#39;t really like the marmalade but the rest was tasty.

We haven&#39;t tried all the burgers in Denver, but the LoDo Combo would be hard to beat. The burger uses two beef patties (Colorado prime), carmelized onions, American cheese and a Thousand Island style dressing. The result is like a gourmet version of a Big Mac. 
My wife added egg and bacon. That is the right choice. While bacon is typically an afterthought on many burgers, this bacon could stand on its own. It&#39;s crispy and slightly sweet, adding texture and contrast with the sweetness of the pickles. 
The combo comes with fries (fresh and on the thin side) and a small salad of mixed greens.

Frank had steak and eggs with a really spicy sweet potato hash, and I had eggs benedict with lox, both pictured below.  My eggs were perfectly poached, but I would have preferred the greens to be served in a little pile on the side instead of strewn all over the top.  They may have been going for a salad Lyonnaisse riff with the poached eggs and greens mixed up, but the dish wasn&#39;t otherwise French, so I found that presentation to be muddled.  Frank&#39;s steak was perfectly cooked, although his requested over easy egg was at least over medium.  As far as cocktails go, my mimosa was fine (how would one mess up a mimosa?), and Frank said his Bloody Mary above average.

I wouldn&#39;t race back, but it was fine.  Perhaps we should have ordered differently.  In any case, it&#39;s not a bad choice, but I&#39;d think there might be better choices in the area."

We descended on the bean, a  party of 12, from a nearby gallery where we had been sipping wine, and they were delighted to take us at the last minute!  We called and within 10 minutes, they had a table ready when we arrived like gypsies. Kudos!

Some of the food options were stunning and amazing, like the Beef Tartare that is pictured.  Unique and very tasty, the tartare was a delicious upgrade on a classic!

Service was good, the wine was good.  We tried the Salmon- very subtle cooked with crispy skin and artichokes.  The Rabbit with fresh pasta was delicious. The deserts were unusual- a deconstructed cherry pie, for instance!  And chocolate cake with peanut butter powder- YUM.  The cheese plates were to die for, and overall this was a very good DINING experience.

So why not five?  I am not sure.  Something about the location screamed &#34;BAR&#34; and &#34;CASUAL&#34; so to have super foodie options did not quite match the venue.

I had one of the better burgers I&#39;ve ever tasted here during my visit; The Brunch Burger.

They start with two beef patties topped with American cheese before adding maple bacon, pickles, caramelized onions, a fried egg and then drizzling the whole thing with just a touch of maple syrup and special sauce.  The result is a sweet and savory taste explosion that can satisfy your Sunday hunger better than any all-you-can-eat breakfast buffets.

The Squeaky Bean also hosts a bingo game during their brunch on Sundays.  Anyone who is at the restaurant can play along with the 1950s vintage bingo board. Bingo goes from 12:30 until 2 and you can win fun prizes, like free drinks, entire bottles of wine/prosecco, discounts on your bill, or vouchers for your next visit.  It&#39;s all in good fun and your experience won&#39;t be overwhelmed by it if you choose to just eat and enjoy.

If the brunch burger doesn&#39;t quite fit the bill for your early-Sunday mood, plenty of other little delicacies were quite tempting.  The Squeaky Bean French Toast, for example, is a decadent take on a classic; one which includes bread pudding, berries, and banana pudding.  My friend ordered this and had to throw in the towel before the final bell.  Or their frittata, which is made with egg whites, crimini, onion puree, brie, and guajillo salsa - it also looks amazing.

It&#39;s also nice that The Squeaky Bean is in the heart of Lodo which is a really cool place to spend a relaxing of fun afternoon on the weekend.  I highly recommend giving it a try and I wrote more about it on my website, beeffanatic.com if you care to visit!"

But my first meal there was incredibly uneven (some great stuff, some not great stuff, and very strange service) so it took me a LONG time to give it another try for dinner. I finally gave in after hearing about their partnership with a local student farm.

Service was much better (we&#39;ll blame that one guy, who hopefully isn&#39;t there anymore, from my previous visit). Service was friendly and relaxed and our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wines. The menu no longer had the confusing groupings that made us order thinking we were getting small plates to share and ended up with generous bowls of difficult-to-share noodles or soup. 

The beef &#34;larger plate&#34; was good, with a delicious celery root puree. The duck breast was good, though a little saltier than I prefer (as someone who doesn&#39;t cook with salt at home, the extra salt that seems to be used at altitude can be too much for me). With both dishes, I felt like the vegetable accompaniment was the star. I might opt for a vegetarian meal next time. They do produce right here. 

I&#39;ll definitely keep coming back for the bar. And now I&#39;m hoping to visit for dinner again or try bingo brunch."

It&#39;s never overly crowded, the beer selection is great, and the food is delicious. My only complaint is that the service is a little slow -- so if you&#39;re in a hurry to get back to the office, it might be a little tough.

I highly recommend trying the Fried Chicken BLT (essentially a burger with bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and fried chicken). The fried chicken here is fantastic! It&#39;s not overly breaded or too fried, making it perfect inside the burger.

They also have an amazing $15 lunch deal for a double cheeseburger and a Coors Banquet. This cheeseburger is HUGE! For those of you who love (and miss) In N Out, this is actually kind of close."

The food was great quality, but they had very little selection on the menu. There were about 6-8 choices for entrees and then appetizers, but that&#39;s it. The portions we received were extremely small for the price paid, but we loved how it tasted. Our drinks were also of high quality and we were happy with them. 

Our service was extremely polite and informative, but very slow. Initially our server gave us info about the restaurant, but we didn&#39;t see him a lot after our order. It took about 30 minutes to receive our entree and we&#39;re beginning to think they forgot about us. We wanted to order dessert, but it took so long for us to have he chance to put in our order that we decided to just get our check and go. 

We would go again for fancy food and if we weren&#39;t super hungry, but probably not for a full on dinner."

Their Brunch Bingo definitely adds to the fun .  We were served monkey bread which was tasty with the Nutella cheese topping and almond butter on bread. 

Some great selections on their menu, however I wasn&#39;t in the mood for breakfasty food and I ordered their cheese burger with sweet chili bacon (which most of my table ordered).  The burger was very tasty and large (I didn&#39;t realized when I ordered it was a double patty.  My only gripe is I am not a raw bread person and would have preferred the bun to have been toasted.

I must say I thought this place very MEH. Ok. Not rocking my world.

I selected the lamb shoulder. This dish is a DIY wrap. Sort of middle eastern with the cucumber salad and yogurt. Price $14. Not really a ton of food here and not very flavorful.

My co-worker wasn&#39;t in love with his meal either. Apparently the pork and greens sandwich had some weird tasting greens on it (probably collard greens). He picked off every strand. I think he thought this place was &#39;meh&#39; too.

I liked the decor. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever seen a chandelier made of spoons before. Nor have I ever dined to the sounds of the Supremes at 11am. Different is refreshing."

I didn&#39;t feel a strong desire to go back until recently, after hearing so many good things about their brunch...that, and the Bingo Brunch just sounded like a darn good time. 

I made a reservation to attend Bingo Brunch with a girlfriend and my mother, and we got a good seat at the bar. I was really pleased with the service we received - everybody who worked there was super nice. The Bingo host was hilarious, and although we didn&#39;t win anything, it definitely made for an entertaining meal. 

That&#39;s where things fell short, however...the meal. My mother and I both ordered the frittata. Based on the menu description and the price, I was expecting a decent sized frittata, a good amount of veggies (I mean, Squeaky Bean is kinda known for their veggies), and most places put too much cheese on their dishes, if anything, so I never gave a second thought to whether it would be enough food. The portion was hilariously TINY. We knew the second we got our food that we&#39;d be starving if we didn&#39;t order a side of toast, so we immediately asked for that. It was egg whites with a half a brussels sprout, a child sized handful of arugula, a teaspoon of onion puree and salsa and MAYBE half an ounce of brie. Not only that, but based on the description, I thought it would be a bit more exciting, flavor-wise, but it fell short. Even the apple butter that came with our english muffin tasted more like apple sauce. It wasn&#39;t so good on toast. 

So there ya have it. 3 tries, and the food is still not doing it for me. They definitely get kudos for a fantastic staff and fun Bingo though."

However, when an establishment hires bartenders who &#34;don&#39;t feel like&#34; - his words - making drinks that you&#39;ve specifically come there for (Winter Warmer/Denver Passport holders beware), then not only is my business lost, but then everyone else I come into contact with. And I&#39;ve run into a lot of Denver passport holders.

For people who think I&#39;m arbitrarily handing out 1* reviews, I went there twice to get this specific drink and it wasn&#39;t available both times. The substitution isn&#39;t anywhere near what is advertised on the passport - completely different style and liquor.

The drinks are the best thing here. I ordered a burger and even though it was supposed to come with fries it came with potatoes. Apparently they had run out of fries! It would have been nice to know rather than told only when asked. The burger was bland at best. Probably had better at sonic. This would appear to be, at best, a place for the younger drinkers who aren&#39;t perturbed about decent quality food.

I had never been but the menu looked great and much more interesting than your average brunch fare. Unfortunately, brunch was a pretty solid disappointment. 

They seem to be catering to those who are looking to get (more) drunk at brunch, which is a smart move because you need to be drunk to overlook the obvious problems.

We had two apps, the liver pate and the pimento cheese, which were both pretty good, but the cheese more so. The liver in the pate was overly stretched and as a result had very little liver flavor. The accompanying rhubarb sauce also overpowered this muted pate. These two apps of putting cold spreads on a plate and making toast took about 15 minutes to come out of the kitchen. A bit long given the brunch rush was over. 

However, we soon found out the kitchen is not slow as our main course came out about 4 minutes later while we were still very much working on the apps. The food runners seemed to hesitate for a moment, then decided fuck it and just stuffed the table with more food. 

Coursing issues aside the food was all around a disappointment. Croque madame had very little bechamel, burnt bread, and useless sliced potatoes inside of the sandwich. 

Brunch burgers had bottom buns that were soaked through and both buns were slathered with a house special sauce that would have accompanied fried fish and chips nicely but did little for the burger. The sides of potatoes they came with were cold, greasy, and had clearly been cooked long before the food left the kitchen. The accompanying hollandaise was cold before it hit the table and unusual in flavor and texture. 

The last, and most palatable, dish was the beans and rice. Beans were seasoned well and cooked decently. Sadly, the rice was completely hammered and unseasoned making it taste mushy and flavorless. The bowl of rice and beans also came out with a pool of fat sliding around in the bottom which was very unappealing. 

All in all a pretty shitty brunch experience. The worst part is, while I am not sure the experience could have ever been great, it definitely could have been pretty good if the kitchen cared or even if just the person sending out the food did. I don&#39;t know if the crew was hungover, lazy, or just checked out but they definitely were not trying very hard. They also 86ed their waffles and pancakes 90 minutes before service was over because I am guessing they use the same batter for both (also not trying) and they were not willing to make more. Cold food, soggy buns, grease on the plate, and sending apps and entrees out back to back are all easy to fix if you want to. The fact that they didn&#39;t want to today means I probably won&#39;t be back to try dinner or anything else."

My dining partner and I had been looking forward to to visiting this place.  I have a thing for good lighting and if anyone has good lighting and gives a soft inviting glow to the streets of downtown, it is this place!  Once you enter you will fall even more in love with their decor. They have an old bingo board, mirrors, and wood accents everywhere.  They also poor your drinks over fancy hand shaved ice, including hand chipped ice balls, and the wine is poured from a science lab beaker. They really outdid themselves with decor and the little things that make them stand out. 

Their cocktails were delicious and they offer great happy hour options and prices.  We had beers and a mule.  They also have a special called smokey and the bandit  which includes a can of coors banquet and a shot of old grand-dad bonded bourbon.  I like when places double the fun like that! 

From there it went down hill.  We got a broccoli small plate and the chicken wings.  The broccoli was ok but the chicken wings were literally pink inside and not cooked. We took a couple bites and didn&#39;t eat anything else.  While our waiter (aka the bartender), already unattentive, finally made it over to clear our plates, he didn&#39;t say anything about taking our full plates of food away. (like, how about... was it good?  Was something wrong? Etc.)  When he brought the bill back I decided to speak up and just said, you know...I didn&#39;t say anything when you cleared our plates but the chicken wings were extremely under-cooked and you should just let the kitchen know to cook them longer for the other guests so no one gets raw chicken like we did.  The waiter gave a laugh and said that the menu specifies the way they are cooked (points to word I did not know what it meant) and that is the way they were meant to be served.  This blew my mind because I don&#39;t know who would in (their right mind) eat chicken raw. I also did not appreciate be spoken to like I am so uncool for not knowing my culinary terms... which might I add ar enot on the online menu because I checked for reference.

So, I probably won&#39;t be back.  I could have a cocktail here again but the food and service were very disappointing."

Two of us arrived before the other three and we were promptly seated. Several in our party had particular dietary requirements and there were enough choices on the menu to make everyone happy. I had a hash that was imaginative and satisfying. Service was spot on.
Having made my reservation online, I was a little surprised to receive a confirming phone call (them wanting me to confirm that I still planned to show up) the day before the date. That&#39;s a little like visiting a doctor."

Don&#39;t get confused by the name, this is a great restaurant and bar in the LoHi neighborhood.  A great casual and friendly vibe makes SB a perfect happy hour or brunch spot and it&#39;s a great place to meet friends for drinks.  They have a great wine selection that goes well with their delicious charcuterie options.  

I haven&#39;t tried too many of their dinner entree options but their small plates are always fresh and artfully assembled.  The brunch benedict options are all excellent and are usually my go to.  Paired with an expertly crafted bloody mary and it makes for a great Saturday or Sunday morning.

The service is friendly and laid back.  This is the type of place that you don&#39;t mind coming and hanging out at for a while, making friends with the other diners at the bar or at nearby tables and chatting about various cocktails.

Make no mistake, this is no coffee shop."

Win #2- Great waitress, with great sense of humor and sense of fun, and rest of staff was lovely too

Win #3- Not just bacon and eggs or pancakes. Eclectic menu full of sweet and savory deliciousness. I had the pork hash and it was wonderful! Big chunks of meat, brussels sprouts, egg, and other yummies. Also had to have a side of grits!

Win #4- GRITS! I love me some grits, and fancy, creamy non-traditional grits served with shaved pecorino cheese on top was to-die-for. Seriously craveable!!

Win #5- Creative cocktails! I had a pretty standard bloody Mary but their cocktail list was fun and definitely had some other bevvies I need to try.

Great environment. Open, airy, not too loud, simple yet trendy feeling decor. Prices were reasonable too!

I will absolutely come back from lunch, dinner, snacks, and any other time I need something unique and yummy!"

Had beef because it was the only thing on the menu that seemed vaguely interesting. It was decent, but wouldn&#39;t order that again, or anything else that was on the menu.

It was pretty good but because of the way we were treated. We were there for brunch today and spent a lot of money. We had probably been there for about 2 hours when the hostess came up to us and said that they needed our table and we had to leave. Now, I wouldn&#39;t have been so offended if she has been polite but she was extremely rude! I would say given the amount of downtown brunches this restaurant should strive harder to have repeat business."

Made a reservation, for a party of 6 several weeks ago before that evening.  When we arrived before 17:30hrs, our table is already ready, prepared.  2 of my friends came earlier than I was.

We were seated near the Entrance, and in between the Bar Area.  I am surprised that they offer HAPPY HOUR Prices with Bar food, and since we were there at those times, some of my friends managed to order those items.  SCORE!  The Main Menu is &#34;clipped&#34; on Old Cooking/Recipes Books.  It brought that kind of nostalgic memories in some shape or form.  If ONLY I could take the time to read all the recipes while I there.  *Happy Sigh*

Awesome service by our Main Server her name is Minetta.  She definitely deserved the Glowing 5 Stars in my opinion.  Throughout the service, since there are food allergies among my friends and I, Minetta specifically noted it, and even suggest several items from the Menu.  She makes sure, that everyone receive their food without any worries at all.  *DOUBLE SCORE*!!

From what I could recall my friends ordered the following items :

*   Chicken Pate, Red Pepper Jam, Grain Mustard &amp; Toast
*   2 orders of Brussels Sprouts with Thai vinaigrette, Cornflakes &amp; Peanuts
*   Red &amp; Yellow Beets with Pistachio, Honey Yogurt, Sassafrass Root and Cocoa Nib
*  2 orders of Salmon Roasted Pearl Onion, Five-Spice, Salsify, Pickled Jalapeno &amp; Pine Nut Crumble
*  Roasted Cauliflower
*  Braised Greens 
*  Moules and Marbles Mussels, New Potato &amp; Uni Mayo
*  2 orders of Bang! Bang! Noodle Spicy Cumin Lamb Bolognese, Szechuan Pepper &amp; Pecorino Romano 

First Appetizers to arrive at our table was at 17:44hrs.

For Appetizers, I opt to have the Octopus.  The Octopus comes ONLY with 4 Pieces, and the Bulk was the Tentacles or &#34;Suckers&#34;.  This dish comes with Red cabbage, Chili, Bonito and Lemon Eemulsion.  I like the Octopus.  Tender, flavorful and DELICIOUS, I wish to have MORE!  For this Appetizer alone, I want to rate it as 4 stars, but for the pricing at $16 can be a little pricy to some...  Hmmn.. what do you expect??  *SAD FACE &amp; Sigh*

The ONLY Qualm I have about this establishment is the waiting time from the Appetizer and the Main Entrée.  The wait for the Main Entrée, took awhile to be ready for us.  Maybe the kitchen was slammed with multiple orders from other patrons alike.  Coz about 18:46hrs, then we received our First Main Entrée of Lamb Bolognese, followed by the Salmon Entrée and my Entrée.

My Main Entrée, I ordered The Lamb Shank.  Its the Buckner Family Lamb Shank, Lentils, Curry, Yogurt, Pistachio and Pomegranate.  The cost of this Main Entrée alone was 36!!!  Yaw Zaaa!!  Hmmm... YES its HUGE, you can Definitely make that Lamb Shank as a weapon, but the flavors are very complex and &#34;fighting&#34; each other.  Maybe you will like it, but for me, its just A-OK.  I am still intrigued with the flavors.  I guess since I am slightly full with my late Lunch, I decide to bring the Left-overs of this Lamb Shank home aka to-go boxes. 

All in all, I like what I had, and same goes to my friends who came here through our Meetup Group.  YES, this establishment maybe Pricy aka &#34;SPLURGE&#34; to some, hence I will dedicate such establishment like this for Special Occasion. 

Left this establishment about 19:20hrs ish.

I ordered the wings hesitantly - I love buffalo wings and usually like to stick with the normal buffalo flavor, but these blew me away. So delicious. I also had a dessert, the pot du creme - yum.

Alright, sorry. I thought that was funny.

The food at the Squeaky Bean is good, but not terribly inspired. The larger plates are still pretty small. Although I appreciate a reasonable portion, I just found that the beef plate wasn&#39;t worth the price. It was essentially beef, potato and onions, presented to look really fancy but it just tasted very plain. 

I will say that the produce is excellent. The farm-to-table approach leads to delicious, simple vegetable dishes. I had a beet appetizer that was great but pricey. 

Across the board though, the food was fine but nothing to write home about. I&#39;m not sure I was getting the hype.

Our waiter was attentive and friendly. He kept our drinks refreshed and made sure we were enjoying our dinner. No complaints there at all.
 
I&#39;ve heard that the Squeaky Bean has a great brunch and a great burger during Happy Hour. Perhaps I&#39;ll update my review after I&#39;ve tried that."

Fun and Modern with a retro twist
We arrived early for our reservation on a busy Saturday night, so we took a seat  at the bar and grabbed a drink while we waited.  The bartender that served us was nice and happy to see us.  They had a wine menu that was actually tasty and fitting for the majority of most peoples&#39; pallet.  Try one of there speciality drinks from the Mystery Science section.  There retro feel was even showed in the Coors banquet can,  which I enjoyed before being seated.  One of the people at the table could not have tap water due to a medical requirements. So one of the staff members ran around the corner to get a bottle of water.  This was without us asking for a solution or anything. To me that is a quality of everywhere. 

To the food! There wasn&#39;t one thing on the menu that we ordered, that wasn&#39;t tasty and the presentation was pretty good. Not over the top were you feel overwhelmed. Things that stood out for me would be the beet salad, the beef duo and the salmon. I would recommend you trying this joint and take some time and enjoy the food the service and the atmosphere."

I liked the atmosphere and the chilled &amp; laid-back environment. We came on a Saturday right before 6pm and asked for a table for three. Although it looked like there were plenty of tables available, they said all were reserved and we would have to sit at the bar. I guess that was okay because the happy hour is only available at the bar anyways. 

So we had a seat, and the bartender gave us some water and menus. I&#39;m trying eat healthy, and was able to order the brussels sprouts with all the toppings on the side. My friends ordered the risotto, mussels and a ginger beer. I tried the beer and it was really good. It was strong, but that&#39;s okay with me ;). I tried a bite of the risotto and it seemed undercooked, but the flavor was good. The mussels were very fishy tasting, but I liked it. My friends didn&#39;t agree though, so I guess it just depends on your preference. By the time we left, it was close to 8pm and the restaurant was packed. It&#39;s definitely wise to set a reservation in advance."

I love the speciality cocktails, they use dry ice to give them a nice flare of creativity. The drinks are delicious and potent while adding a fun experience to your evening.

We ordered the Brussel sprouts as a side not an appetizer and they were probably the best thing we ate (but I&#39;ve been told that they&#39;ve been removed from the menu, not sure why they would do that). We also had the fried chicken, it&#39;s supposed to be amazing and I was truly disappointed by this. Our chicken came out greasy, dry, and soggy. The chicken itself had great flavor but the fact that it was not crispy was a tragedy. The steak was lacking in flavor and extremely over cooked, I get all steak medium and this was cooked to at least well done. 

Overall I liked the restaurant for its drinks but I won&#39;t be coming back here for food."

The extensive and eclectic craft cocktails will keep you in great spirits both figuratively and literally.  

The brunch menu is filled with hearty options, I went with the Pork Hash and the &#39;my little mule, Pepe&#39; cocktail.  Yes, this is the name of the Bronco in Romancing the Stone. The hash was well composed, a hearty portion, and finished appropriately with perfectly poached eggs.  The cocktail was perfectly constructed and the hints of lemongrass, lime, and ginger beer were a pleasant compliment to the tequila.  

As an extra bonus they have a vintage, fully functional, bingo board that gets fired up on the weekends with prizes going to the winners.  

Overall a great experience.  The only reason not 5 stars is we had a reservation for 6, but upon arrival the only seating available to us was the bar around the kitchen.  This made it a bit hard to converse with our whole party as we would have been able to at a standard table."

We arrived during the snow storm so not many guests were there, unheard of during DRW. We hadn&#39;t seen the menu beforehand so we were a bit disappointed in it when we were seated. A chicken, a salmon, a vegetarian, and a NY strip for a $45 additional fee. Yes, you read that right. I almost thought they were joking. Excessive IMO. The menu online is slightly different from in person, FYI! 

I had a pleasant salad for the appetizer (called Apples). Flavors were great. I loved the main entree despite being a chicken dish. It was a bit too salty for me, but combined with the arugula, puffed rice, and sauce underneath it was fantastic. The texture of the crispy rice and poppyseeds were perfect with the vegetables. 

Dessert was decent. Brownie sundae with lots of chocolate, pecans, and other hidden gems. Here and there I&#39;d get a burst of salty flavor which I love! 

Service was great. There wasn&#39;t a crowd so we got plenty of attention, maybe a little too much in the beginning--felt a bit rushed to order. 

Overall great experience with decent DRW menu. I&#39;d definitely go back to try out the full menu!"

The service was incredible. The cocktails were stiff but tasty. The appetizers were fantastic. The entrees were divine. And the dessert, namely the lemon custard/vanilla ice cream type dessert, was one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had.

Our waiter made suggestions and was honest about things that weren&#39;t good. He refilled our water anytime it was 1/3 way gone. The dessert chef came to our table to ask how we liked the desserts.

The only warning I&#39;ll give is that it&#39;s expensive. Cocktails are about $10 each. Appetizers are in the $15-$20 wheelhouse and they&#39;re not large. Entrees are $25 - $40. I had Paella that was $39. Desserts were $10.

I like the concept of their menu which is based on farm Grown items and the sustainable farming value.

After a wonderful brunch, I had high expectations for dinner, which it did not live up to for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the fried chicken was awesome, but the sides weren&#39;t as good. if they put the fried chicken on the brunch menu, I would be a very happy camper for sure.

Several cocktails are just $5 (I recommend the Thyme Bandit) and you can choose from a variety of breads and spreads for $5 each- they are not available on the regular menu. We had the pimento cheese with bacon jam. OMG- SO freakin&#39; delicious. They have a gluten free bread option which is more like a chip but it was good just the same. 

For dinner we started with the Fois Gras. DO IT. So yummy. The dippin&#39; dots are like creamy drops of ice cream- seriously. Such a fun taste for your tongue.

Next up was the squid and chorizo with romesco. Totally delicious- again. The chorizo was out of this world fantastic and I wish I could put that sauce on everything. 

For our entrees, hubs had the Charred Onion Risotto with Steak and per our server&#39;s suggestion, I had the Goat. The Risotto was amazing and if you love onions, you will love this- though I can&#39;t imagine paying $28 for it without any meat. (Steak is a $10 upcharge.) Sadly, the Goat was not great. It came looking like a plant (see picture) and though the flavor was good, it was a bit dry and all of the foliage on top did not really &#34;go&#34; with the slow-braised goat.

Gluten free dessert options are limited. It was either the Cherry bar without the crust or ice cream. Since we&#39;d done the tasting, we did the Cherry Bar but over all I wasn&#39;t too into it. I definitely think a restaurant of this calibur should have more options.

Lovely dinner but I think I&#39;d stick to the smaller plates and happy hour."

I thought it was great. I made a reservation 15 minutes in advance, just in case, and we were seated right away. By the window! then our lovely waiter stopped by and offered drinks. While we thought it over, he disappeared and reappeared with two glasses of champagne to celebrate! Yum.

I had the Fried Chicken BLT. Delicious. My only complaint is that it was so large! Barely fit in my (not small) mouth. Had to deconstruct, but it was worth it. It came with farm greens or fries, but the waiter allowed me to sub the soup of the day, which was a vegan parsnip creamy dream (I know, I know, but it was sublime!)...

Everything was great. Definitely go for a celebration and they&#39;ll assist you!"

In fact, they did not bring out a normal menu, so I wasn&#39;t sure what all else they will serving.  It did not matter because the food was amazing.  The appetizer I had was shrimp and grits and it was the most amazing shrimp and grits I have ever had.  Just a fantastically buttery, salty, and succulent taste all in one bite.  The cornish game hen in buffalo sauce was both creative and incredibly satisfying.  Great creative and great taste.  I ended up getting a brownie because I was not adventerous about the grapefruit curd.  Don&#39;t be like me.  Get the Grapefruit curd.  I got to have a bite and it too was amazing.  
The servers were very knowledgeable and take pride in the source of their food which entails a seasonal menu based on local products and farms.

Yelpers, I seldom disagree with your collective wisdom and the recommended brussels sprouts app was no exception. Even Michelle Obama, alleged to be a non-fan, would have loved these, I&#39;m convinced. I can&#39;t even describe what makes them so good, but I&#39;ll try. The sprouts were perfectly crispy,had the right hint of salt and the peanuts were a nice touch. Not sure what they were cooked with, but super savory and flavorful they sure were. The kale chips were also good, but not quite as drool worthy.

Hubby had cod and crab and there was none left on his plate. I will take that as a good sign.

I ordered the cheeseburger sans cheese from the bar menu and it came out, you guessed it, with cheese. Womp womp. I was super bummed as I hate to waste food/send it back, so I did my due diligence in scraping it off. The fries did not, unfortunately, redeem the burger debacle because they were just not that exciting.

However, the Squeaky Bean more than redeemed itself. Not only did they not charge for the burger, they also brought us out a dessert (with a candle, no less!) to make up for the mishap. I was super impressed by the service; one or the other would have been enough for me to feel avenged, but the combo was unexpected and says a lot about how they view customers. I&#39;d come back to try something else on the menu, based on the service alone. Well played, Squeaky Bean.

If you can&#39;t find parking, you can valet. You can also park near 1430 Wynkoop as the lot is deceptive. It says private/reserved on each space, but that&#39;s only during the week. At $5 for an evening, it&#39;s one of Denver&#39;s best kept parking secrets, at least for now."

My boyfriend and I have been waiting to get a chance to try this place out. As a result of the weather I think they weren&#39;t as busy as they usually are. So, we were seated fairly quickly and many servers saw us and tried to help us.

Once we sat down, we ordered a couple of drinks to satiate my thirst for something new. Let&#39;s just say, I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t remember the name, but it had these delightful cherries in it! It was like bursts of starbursts. I&#39;ve never had cherries like this before. Made me feel a little fancy :)

Then we ordered the lamb hearts with squash and Brussel sprouts. Both were great. I was surprised on the tenderness of the lamb hearts and how the squash tasted just being roasted. The Brussel sprouts were crispy and had a great crunch to them.

As our entree, we got the half chicken with a Korean spicy yet sweet flavor to it. Kinda typical flavoring to me. The green tomatoes were pretty good that came along with it.

The snapper was a great choice though! An entire snapper was fried! I am definitely weak in the knees for some fried deliciousness. Great job on that guys! Overall, good place to try out"

It was midmorning, and we were reservation-less and the place was packed. Despite this fact, the hostess was polite and accomondating and when we said we&#39;d be happy to sit outside we were seated immediately. Even outside, the server was attentive and polite, and it felt that he was always readily available.

Started with a Mimosa for me and Bloody Mary for her, her Bloody Mary was the winner, with a perfect balance of spiciness, perfect way to start the day (although she was surprised, as another reviewer noted to find the olive wasn&#39;t pitted). For food, the shrimp and grits, while small was incredible and not the textbook flavor and presentation often associated with a brunch meal of shrimp and grits.

The food was reasonably priced but on the higher side, the portions while very good and very well excecuted where slightly on the small side for the price paid. The brunch menu was on the shorter side but had a good amount of variety. While not somewhere I would recommend for a weekly brunch meal, absolutely worth stopping in from time to time, especially in the summer with a great patio."

The burger the guests next to me are having is &#34;incredible&#34; by their standards, and I am very much enjoying the charcuterie board myself.

While admittedly a bit nosy, I have been listening to Chris talking to my neighbors at the bar and he has been wonderfully knowledgeable and friendly to them, which is nice to know that the friendliness extends throughout the staff.

It would also be a nice place to take a date--someone you don&#39;t know well. You&#39;ll each get a light dish of food, there won&#39;t be any unpleasant smells or unpleasant tastes, you won&#39;t fill up but you&#39;ll spend a respectable amount of money, and you will each have an unmemorable experience.

I went with a large group during lunch.  I ordered the pumpkin soup, which was probably a mistake (very few restaurants make good soups). But the soup sounded so seasonal and delicious!  I was charged $10.80 for a bowl of soup.  There was no bread or anything with it, so I was practically starving to death. What made it particularly cruel was that the soup was unsalted and tasteless.  However, I think most of their food is probably pretty good.  Other people in my group got the BLT--and everyone who ordered that RAVED about it. 

I got the lemon curd with dehydrated blueberries for dessert. That was delicious.  Once again, though, it was $8 for a tiny dessert that was not filling OR shareable.  So I spent $20 and my stomach is growling.

I will probably return here if I need a generic &#34;mid-priced upscale&#34; spot in downtown Denver.  The server was very nice, the atmosphere and decor were fashionable, and the food was acceptable.  I just wish there was a little more heart, and heartiness, in the food."

My hubs and I have since moved from the &#39;hood but when I saw Rise and shine had reopened, we made the trek in from the burbs for this goodness. The new location attracts a new to Denver, hipster crowd from the new Sloans Lake development south of here (for christ&#39;s sake, they thought Huckleberry was actually called coffee shop- but that&#39;s a different rant...), so just be aware of this. It&#39;s definitely not the same ambiance as Lowell but, hey, I can&#39;t fault the owners for that. (Damn hipsters, ya ruin everything),

It also has a cute patio where you can enjoy your biscuits while listening to the hipsters rant about nothing. We love the Chapel Hill with honey (so tasty!) and pretty much any of their biscuits of the day. On this particular day it was a manchego biscuit - OH so good!

They have now reopened at this location and we were excited to come back and have a biscuit sandwich for breakfast!

They usually have a biscuit of the day on the board and today&#39;s was Avery&#39;s Lasso IPA biscuit.  They usually have samples of their biscuit of the day by the register and I was able to try before I bought-this biscuit also had paprika.  I chose it.  You can also choose a regular biscuit.  I ordered my biscuit with bacon, egg, and cheese.  I added an orange juice.  I loved it!  The biscuit had a hoppy note from the IPA and was flaky.  The egg, cheese, and bacon were warm and melted together.  Such a good way to start the day!

And, if you&#39;re super bored why not bring you MacBook and a relax with a good cup of coffee. Lol

All that aside , I enjoyed their coffee .
We wanted to try their Homemade biscuits, so we ordered a biscuit sandwich.
They were tasty but, I wasn&#39;t drooling at the mouth with flavor exploding with every bite . Does that make this a bad place ?? No. But I&#39;m pretty sure my wife could make this same biscuit at home . I guess if you&#39;re a single person or your wife/girlfriend is just lazy in the kitchen then by all means stop by and enjoy .
The biscuits reminded me of the buttery flakey ones you can buy at the grocery store . Honest !
In sure all the &#34;Hipsters&#34; will keep this place alive and well . But I won&#39;t go out of my way to eat here again . 

As my second time here I&#39;ve decided this place absolutely disgusts me .
I support local businesses but this place has one thing in mind , to make a dime off of everything they can.
3.75 for 5 tiny containers of jam ?? Oh, and the honey is also an additional charge .
After I spent over 20.00 for biscuits, buying jam to enjoy them with is additional??
I&#39;m sorry but should jam or honey be included or optional after you just spent a premium on biscuits?
I can buy a huge glass jar of homemade jam anywhere for 3.75. 
Why don&#39;t they just put a damn parking meter out front too!?
I truly hope they change or just close shop and let another local business take place . These greedy businesses are ruining our neighborhoods and our economy ."

They always have a creative buscuit of the day... Honey Almond.... Pale Ale... Creative flavors a like that... Fun!

It&#39;s getting three stars because the two times I went it was a bit hit and miss with biscuit freshness. A few of the biscuits I&#39;ve tried were a little chewy and on the stale side - totally edible, just not PERFECT, which I expected since this is what their establishment makes... Biscuits.... BUT, I&#39;ve also had PERFECT ones, so who knows, yours will probably be great, you should go. Also the bacon seems like boring thin grocery store crap bacon.... lost a star just for that.

I was still in pain on the following Monday, so I went to the dentist. Turned out whatever I bit on had cracked my tooth. A tooth that never had a prior issue. I had to have my tooth removed and an implant put in. I called Rise and Shine to tell them. But because I had paid cash and they didn&#39;t give me a receipt... I was screwed.

+ beer and wine
-- no beer for you before Noon
- napkins are still crap

05DEC2015
This is a very popular place on a cold Saturday morning. Lots of young people, families and some old farts like me. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their morning.

++ Wall Street Journal - 6 days a week!
+ Super friendly service.
+ Tasty biscuit of the day. An added egg made it quite delicious. Excellent value for just small amount more than an Egg McMuffin.
+ Good coffee, Pablo&#39;s.
+ Hip, happening atmosphere.
+ Wi-Fi.

- Crappy plastic flatware.
- Thin napkins.
- No booze.

Sadly, they did not keep the Rustic Tavern neon sign. Do you know how difficult it is these days to get a neon sign permit?"

I was born and raised in Raleigh so feel that I am qualified to say that the biscuits are delicious and just how they should taste- buttery, soft, perfect texture. Every time I visit, the staff is extremely friendly- calling on me by name and engaging in genuine small talk instead of the run of the mill &#39;how are you&#39;. It&#39;s great for breakfast, lunch and i&#39;ve even been for dinner! 5/5 stars- I recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy, friendly small business joint."

They have seating and room to move around now too. I believe their new location was once a windowless dive bar called &#39;The Rustic&#39; which was a place I never seemed to need a drink bad enough to brave stepping into. They really made a huge change in the appearance of the building in a short time - it has become a bright and welcoming place, with windows that wrap around the building. The interior is very clean and open. 

Anyhoo, the food is delicious and probably the best breakfast sandwich in town, especially if you&#39;re a fan of North Carolina biscuit sandwiches. They have chicken sandwiches, country ham, egg and cheese, Bojangles-style cinnamon biscuits with frosting, and a number of others and every sandwich is named after a town in North Carolina. I can only compare them to what I&#39;ve had in NC during a number of visits over the years, but my husband is a Charlotte-native and seems to think the food here reminds him of home, so there&#39;s that. 

It&#39;s usually super busy here on weekend mornings and you will be waiting a while if you come before 10. After 10 there is no wait, but then they&#39;re frequently out of the biscuit of the day and cinnamon biscuits. A dilemma for sure.."

The boyfriend got the biscuit of the day (Gouda cheese) with bacon and egg. He said the egg was cooked just right and there was just a hint of the Gouda with each bite. I got the Raleigh: roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish. It had a good amount of horseradish but was not overdone. The biscuits were flaky but didn&#39;t fall to pieces on the sandwiches.

As far as the judgmental whiner&#39;s complaints, he&#39;s obviously never been a business owner or he would know it&#39;s never easy running and keeping a local business afloat, and that EVERYTHING costs the business owner, things that he can&#39;t stuff in his face. 

I&#39;m not the NorthFace/MacBook kinda guy, but I&#39;m more like the construction, hearty eater kinda guy who enjoys good food and supporting local mom and pop businesses. 

Maybe he should get off his high horse and realize everyone doesn&#39;t owe him something  simply because he spends his money there. (Even if it is a whopping $4.00).   Stick to the local Denny&#39;s where you can drown yourself in free jelly....I&#39;m just saying."

Back when they shared a space with Basil Doc&#39;s on 32nd &amp; Perry (now Blue Pan), I always liked stopping in.... But it wasn&#39;t until they closed down that I realized how much I really enjoyed going there for a quick breakfast (especially when the only other nearby option is the small, dense bagels at Dudleroy&#39;s- ugh). Yep, my girl Joni Mitchell said it best: &#34;Don&#39;t it always seem to go, that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve got til it&#39;s gone&#34;.

Fortunately, we didn&#39;t have to wait too long for Rise and Shine to be back in action. They took over the building that formerly housed the Rustic Tavern-- not that you can even tell it&#39;s the same building. Seriously, if you ever went to the Rustic, you need to go to Rise &amp; Shine just to look at the building. Well, you should probably also get a biscuit while you&#39;re there, because they are delicious. In addition to standard buttermilk, they also feature an every changing Biscuit of the Day. These range from sweet (wild berry) to savory (cheddar jalapeno); from common (salt and pepper) to creative (curry), but one thing they have in common is that they are always delicious. I usually like to get mine with egg and cheese but they also have toppings like jam and butter, as well as more lunch-themed sandwich options. And a cinnamon bun-biscuit, which I have always been tempted by but have yet to try.

I went with a biscuit with sausage,egg and cheese and it was simply the best breakfast sandwich I&#39;ve had in years. The biscuit was warm and buttery, the sausage was nice and spicy, and the eggs were cooked to perfection.

The egg and cheese biscuit was good.  I got my husband and son cinnamon rolls.  Here is where my observation/irritation comes into play.  Charging 50 cents for a side of icing for the cinnamon roll is such a annoying concept.  Cinnamon rolls and icing go together (it&#39;s like attempting to deconstruct a donut and charging people for the glaze).  Who gets a cinnamon roll without the icing.  I mean, if you are already committed to eating a cinnamon roll, what harm is the icing really going to do! Okay MAYBE it&#39;s a food allergy thing for some people and I get they want to keep the icing cold, so my beef isn&#39;t the fact that the icing is &#34;on the side,&#34; my problem is charging folks for it.  I know, I sound like an old curmudgeon (I am) but let&#39;s call a cinnamon roll a cinnamon roll and give people the icing for free (raise the price of the actual cinnamon roll if need be).

I saw they do have lunch biscuit sandwiches and a few beers on tap so we will try to do lunch there someday. Very friendly staff and service was pretty quick.

Had the Mongolian, and it came on a pretzel bun. You can also get burgers sans the bun, with a side instead. 

Asked for side of seasoned rice instead of fries and was no problem. Hong, the waitress, then offered a complimentary bowl of their tomato soup. Best I&#39;ve ever had. Not a typical thick or creamy soup, but rather in a broth base with plenty of veggies. 

We will be back often."

If 4.5 stars was an option, I&#39;d do that.

Concept: Love it.  Asian/Burger fusion.  I really dig the fact that I can get a burger with a side of egg rolls or sesame balls.

Service: Super fast and friendly without hovering. I felt very welcome!

Food: Very good.  I tried the Mongolian burger and was pleased with the flavor.  The only downside is that I wasn&#39;t asked how I wanted my burger cooked.  I like medium rare, but the burger came out a solid mid-well.  That being said it was probably the juiciest mid-well burger I&#39;ve had and it was still quite tasty.  I don&#39;t share other Yelper&#39;s opinions about the tomato soup.  It was very good, but not THE BEST THING EVER.  Kinda tasted like vegetable soup to me, actually.

As far as the food, we ordered the red pepper bacon burger, potstickers, fried wantons, and fried rice. The red pepper bacon burger was cooked perfectly with an almost sweet tasking teriyaki glaze of some kind, topped with peppers, cheese, thick cut bacon strips. The flavor combinations were amazing! The fried rice was just as spectacular with some diced fruit as well.

The prices are very reasonable for the portion size. The owner also brought us soup to try as we are waiting for our meal. They get customer service! I will continue to spread the word of this gem because it truly is a unique Asian fusion concept with exceptional service."

I would have never imagined a veggie, bacon, hot sesame oil topping combination on burger.  The server insisted I try the tomato soup.  I told her I&#39;m not a fan of tomato soup but she brought me some to try anyways.  It was really good.  More of a fusion egg drop soup with tomato in it instead of traditional tomato soup.

Great service from the lady who opened the place. Potential franchise. I had a blue cheese burger with fried green beans and tea. For advertisement, the lady brought me a bowl of their tomato soup. The soup was very good. Not thick or overly spicy,,,,it was light with some noodles and Asian vegetables. Everything was very good. The burger had a slight sweet Asian taste to it, but very slight. It&#39;s not a huge patty but plenty big enough. They put a crispy wonton on top of the burger. The best ideas are often the most simplistic. Asian vegetables are used instead of the standard lettuce, tomato, etc. Very nice combination. I choose the fried green beans from an assortment of traditional and nontraditional side items. All of them sounded good and they will let you mix and combine side items as you desire. The fried green beans are a slender green bean, battered and fried and served with a sweet mayo sauce. Very crispy, but not a lot of green bean taste. Everything served fresh and hot and presented well. Oh, at the end of the meal you get a chocolate hard mint. Perfect. Total bill with tax, $12.12.

Update to review: Second visit as good as first! The potstickers are a mild chicken dumpling. Very crispy shell. Also had the sesame balls. The serving is plenty for two people. They taste kinda like a doughnut hole with Nutella inside. Very tasty for a not overly sweet dessert."

The space is small but comfortable, the chef cooks in the open kitchen in front of customers, and the server lady is really friendly. I ordered the hot red pepper bacon burger because I&#39;m always a sucker for spicy food and bacon, and it was BOMB! The quality of beef patty matched the ones from fancy restaurants, only less greasier for a more affordable price. And it was slightly spicy(I can definitely do more), combined with the flavors from grilled cabbages and bacon, making it a perfect meal that I&#39;ve never had before. They have some other creative entries that I didn&#39;t get a chance to try, but I definitely loved the fried green bean appetizer, a great substitute for fries. Overall, I like the idea of combining two cuisine cultures together, creating unique and delicious new food. Recommend it!"

Every one of them were the best. The soup here is incredible. I don&#39;t usually eat soup but this is different.  We came back Sunday for burgers. The sweet potato peanut butter burger is the bomb. Everything that they fry is perfect- crispy and not greasy. Have to try the sesame balls for dessert. This is my new favorite place.

So many five star ratings... we gave them a try.  DELICIOUS!  The owners of Real Thai are not kidding with their restaurant name.  They serve authentic, yummy food the way you want it...  select your style of food (noodles, stir fry, rice plate, curry, etc.) and what you want in it (noodles with broccoli and onions, or carrots and bean sprouts, or or or...), then what protein you want (beef, chicken, pork, tofu), then how hot (1-5).

After calling in an order for take-out, I arrived at the restaurant about 10 min after they said my food would be ready. After waiting to be greeted, I was told that I would have to wait because my food &#34;wasn&#39;t nearly ready&#34; with no apology or acknowledgement of an issue. 

Next, I was informed that they were &#34;out&#34; of the appetizer I had ordered. I had to pick something else and wait to have it prepared.

As I sat waiting, I watched a most disconcerting thing happen. The waitress delivered a dish to a table of two. Five minutes later, she delivered the other person&#39;s entree. Then, she went back to the kitchen and returned with another dish and attempted to deliver it to a second table. The people at the second table said, &#34;That&#39;s not what I ordered.&#34; So she took that dish to the first table and established it belonged there. She left that dish with first table and took away the entree that they had ALREADY BEGUN EATING. She disappeared into the kitchen for about 30 seconds and then came back out and delivered an entree to the SECOND table. It was clear that she brought food that had already been eaten to another table!! Disgusting.

When we finally did get our to go order, it was almost an hour after I had called in the order, not the 30 min we were told. I didn&#39;t get our original appetizer. Nothing was comped, I paid full price, and the waitress did not apologize. 

The food was fine except for the rice noodles being undercooked. But it was not even close to being good enough for me to give this place a second chance. Only go here if you&#39;re okay eating secondhand"

Real Thai is kinda out of the way, tucked into a small shopping center and I must&#39;ve driven by it a hundred times on my way to school before I realized it was even there. The outside is super unassuming and it has just about the most generic name for a Thai restaurant aside from &#34;Thai Food&#34;. That&#39;s not a bad thing, in fact I think that adds to the charm. 
Anyway, the food. Ah, the food. The food. At the restaurant. 
Yeah, it&#39;s not great. I&#39;ve always found it too greasy, and I&#39;ve tried to order something new. It&#39;s just every time it comes out slippery as a fish. I personally don&#39;t like this and it turns me off to the whole place, unfortunately."

My rule of thumb in the past was that either a Thai restaurant had excellent noodles and fried rice, or excellent curry, but never both. This place breaks my longstanding assumption-- and thank goodness for it! I had the best Panang curry I&#39;ve had in probably close to ten years at this establishment. The drunken noodles are among the best I&#39;ve had, just a little drizzle of soy sauce makes it perfect. We also love the Cashew dish, it is a unique and delicious savory dish for any cashew lover. Both the summer rolls and egg rolls are excellent; the summer rolls are a super tasty way to increase your vegetable consumption! We travel a good 25-30 minutes to reach this gem, and it&#39;s worth every minute of the drive. The service can sometimes be a little slow, as they are occasionally understaffed. Again, it is well worth the patience and wait. Don&#39;t overlook this place-- it&#39;s the best Thai I have had anywhere... so far."

Real Thai was a good option. I had yellow curry with tofu and he had red curry with chicken. Very solid, good Thai food.

First off the service should get 10 out of 5 stars - now mind you, I ordered carry out so I did not have a full sit down meal there, that just tells you how stellar the service is! The lady who helped me take my order greeted me with a huge smile, super friendly, and offered me a seat to relax while I waited along with fresh water and promptly refilling it. She was also great with updating me when it would be ready after about 10 minutes. She was super sweet and gave me better service in my 15 minute interaction with her than I have at most full sit down restaurant. She is a true gem and a fantastic face of this business. I will be honest, I did not like the food that much, but due to her kindness I will be back again to support this business. 

Now I mentioned I didn&#39;t like the food however that does not mean they have bad food. The food was hot fresh and okay. Not the best thai I&#39;ve ever had BUT I like really americanized thai food. I have a feeling this was actually really authentic delicious stuff but my puny uncultured palate didn&#39;t appreciate it like it was meant to be.

I left hungry, since they let my food go cold instead of letting me know my order had been up and then when I inquired about this I was met with a highly contentious attitude and no attempt at even a slim apology from the owner about the oversight.

Now that I&#39;m home I&#39;m sort of happy I didn&#39;t bring home the food. I felt like the environment wasn&#39;t as cleanly as I would have preferred. I wouldn&#39;t have probably noticed it as much had I not stopped in the men&#39;s room first, but it was somewhat gross to me.

Me and The Hubs were in the area over the weekend checking out a nearby gardening center and we were starving by the time we left.  This place had so many good reviews so we decided to stop by.  First of all, this restaurant in is an old and unfortunate-looking strip mall.  Don&#39;t let that deter you though.  And when you walk in, the décor is a bit spare. But don&#39;t let that deter you either.  We were greeted when we walked in and asked about seating preference.  We opted for a booth and perused the menu.  One strange thing we noted is that only about two thirds or so of the dining room is furnished with seating.  The other side of the room had tables against the wall and I think no carpet, so I&#39;m not sure what that side is used for, but no matter.

We decided on the Chicken Larb, Pad Thai with tofu, and Garlic &amp; Black Pepper Beef.  Everything was amazing! I noticed one reviewer said that she didn&#39;t like the food too much since she prefers sweeter, more Americanized Thai food.  I&#39;m glad she owned up to that.  Judging by what we had, thankfully this place does not serve the super sweet stuff.  Our food was all super flavorful and savory.  The larb had all the components that make it my favorite Thai dish with just enough heat from the chiles, just enough salt from the fish sauce and just enough sour from lime juice.  We ordered a level &#39;3&#39; on their spiciness scale and it was pretty spicy (not killer, but enough).  The other two dishes we ordered at a level &#39;2&#39; and they were just a little spicy.  I was surprised that the larb was served on mixed greens instead of the more traditional cabbage leaves, but it was still a great dish. I had almost stopped ordering Pad Thai because I hadn&#39;t had a decent version of it since we left SoCal ten years ago.  Too often it&#39;s dripping with a way too-sweet sauce.  Not here.  The Real Thai version was super tasty.  And if you like garlic (and we do) the Garlic and Black Pepper Beef is the way to go.  There wasn&#39;t a ton of garlic or anything, but just enough to give the dish a fabulous flavor.

In a nutshell. the food was great, service was friendly and the food came out pretty fast.  I only wish this place was closer to my house because it&#39;s a keeper.  If you live nearby and haven&#39;t checked it out, you&#39;re really missing something.

PS - Super clean bathroom!"

Moved to the Denver area nearly 3 years ago &amp; have had an extremely difficult time finding good, authentic thai food, until now! 
Food is amazing! It&#39;s been the only restaurant we&#39;ve found where they cook with fresh Thai chilies- a necessity for authentic Thai. 
The service is great! Extremely friendly, pleasant, &amp; accommodating staff. 
They&#39;re currently remodeling the interior of their restaurant for an even better atmosphere. 
This will be the only place we will ever go for Thai. 
Would highly recommend to anyone who wants true thai food."

I stopped in to order some take out. I got the Royal Pad Thai with chicken. I got a level 2 in terms of spiciness since it was a new place and every restaurant has a different definition of the spice scale. It had a bit of heat but I&#39;ll go up a number next time. It was delicious! I&#39;d consider it one of the best pad thai&#39;s I&#39;ve had. Considering I just moved here from out of state and I miss my thai place back home, this is definitely at the top of my list to come back to and try something else. 

While I waited, the hostess gave me a glass of water without even asking. Good service!"

I&#39;ve had the panang curry and the pad cashew nuts. Friends have had the fried rice, drunken noodles, and pad eggplant.  They have all been excellent -- well-cooked vegetables and great flavor. Decent service. 

From a food perspective, I would choose this over all thai in Denver except for Tommy&#39;s. On the other hand, Tommy&#39;s is loud -- with terrible parking -- so this is a better option if I want to have a conversation with dinner."

Sorry Real Thai, I cannot share the same sentiments with all other glowing reviews since these were what I observed and my personal thoughts about our evening.

I was pissed at myself I guess, coz wanting to try Thai for this time around and it was indeed EXTREMELY Underwhelming.

Yes, I cannot deny the establishment was kept clean, and perhaps it could be an isolated incident.  We were there on Thursday October 31st 2013.  Time was about 18:50hrs ish.

When we arrived there is another patron who were already having his Dinner away.

We seat ourselves at the Left Wing of this establishment at one of the booths.  Our lovely waitress, gave us the Menu.

From the Simple Menu, they have Appetizers, Soups, Fried Rice, Noodles, Stir Fry and Curry Entrees.

We opt to order to have the following items :

*  Chicken Satay - 4 sticks/pieces ($6.95)
*  Fried Calamari ($6.95)
*  Thai Chicken Wings ($6.95)

Our Main Entrees were :

*  Pad Volcano ($10.95)
*  Seafood Combination Soup (Tom Yum Malay) ($12.95)

Our beverages we opt for was Jasmine Tea in a Pot ($2.00).  We specifically REQUESTED our food to be THAI HOT.

Take note, the TOGO Menu does not reflect ALL The Items listed in the house menu.

Yes the food came out piping hot, especially the Fried Calamari and the Thai Chicken Wings.  Both the dipping sauce were the same.  Err where is the Authenicity??   Aka you pour Bottled Sweet Chili Sauce and served it as Dipping Sauce??  Err the Chicken Wings was marinated?  Marinated with What???  Sad Sad Case indeed. Unless you can proved me wrong.

The Chicken Satay was underwhelmed due to the fact it came out lukewarm, bland, and just flavorless.  The Chicken Satay was just MEH.  The Dipping Sauce was nothing stellar to begin with.  From my observation the Fried Calamari though its HUGE, it was those PRE-MADE aka from Restaurant Depot Packaging aka Freezer then you just fried them in the fryer, so it was nothing to say about....  Yes, it was Deep Fried Calamari, Overcooked in tempura batter.

Then for the Main Entrée.  Let me start with Hubs entrée.  I cannot deny, what I ate was UNRECOGNIZABLE.  Coz when Hubs specifically asked for Beef in his Main Entrée, to make matter worst, it tasted NOTHING like Beef OR Chicken.  It tasted like DRIED MEAT Fried in a batter and coated with sauce.  *DOUBLE SIGH*  

I asked Hubs to ask our server, but he declined.  I guess Hubs was indeed starving and anything he ate was &#34;A-Okay&#34;.  I think Hubs just wanted to eat, and it was a super long tiring week for us, let alone the DRIVE from the other side of town just to have a disappointing meal.

Its a Generous 2 stars for me personally coz its does NOT reflect Authenticity of Thai Cuisine, though our server is welcoming but the food is pretty BAD.
 
The Seafood Combination Soup (Tom Yum Talay) ($12.95), has the sweet, and sour notes BUT NOT SPICY enough for my liking.  The Soup came out lukewarm, though I cannot deny, I almost choke from the &#34;spice&#34; but NOT THE SPICY choke.  I guess when I try to sip the soup, it went down wrongly.

The Tom Yum Talay comes with huge chunks of Tomatoes, several mushrooms, bell peppers, green onions and Seafood of Imitation Crab Meat aka Fake Crab Meat aka Seafood Stick aka Krab aka Surimi, Shrimp, Mussels and Calamari. The seafood Real Thai put in the Hot Pot, especially the Calamari, are those &#34;frozen kind&#34; - ready made from Restaurant Depot...  Hence making the Calamari, very tough and VERY VERY Chewy...  *TRIPLE SIGH*

But to my surprise, Hub wanted to return and try other dishes coz he said, Real Thai offers some other dishes that other Thai establishment did not offer aka &#34;Variety&#34;...  Hmmm..  Oh well.. we shall see in 1 years time err maybe make it 2??..  Maybe we just ordered the wrong items from Real Thai that evening.  Left the establishment at 19:45hrs ish.

End Of Rant... *SAD FACE &amp; MAJOR SIGH INDEED*

You can pick levels 1-5 on how spicy you want it. Number 3 almost too hot for me and I love it spicy. Nicest waitress ever. Not sure if she is owner. Treats me super good and she always knows what I want when I walk in the door. I eat here about once a week and I&#39;ll keep on coming back.
real-thai-wheat-ridge,Stan D.,yRRtt7GW9KEp93Fepcwd6g,"Arvada, CO",0,1,0,439,32,vPSsm5Jqez_zT8vRuxbjrg,3.0,2014-01-04,"Because of the location, we probably never would have tried this place except for the Groupon we had.  It&#39;s hidden away in a small strip mall, and, without the Groupon, we probably never would have known it was there.  Nonetheless, we did try it, and I may have been too hungry to judge properly, but I liked the food.  On this visit, the food was not the problem as much as the service.  

When we walked in there, there were customers dining, but no employees were visible at all.  We could easily have stood there for 10 or 15 minutes if customers hadn&#39;t encouraged us to sit down.  As it was, there was no silverware on any of the tables, and we were never given any.  We were also never given any menus.  Fortunately, I happened to pick up a take out menu on the way in, and, as for the silverware, I was able to round some up along with chopsticks, and some napkins.  Even after taking our order, and bringing our appetizers, the waitress never thought to bring us silverware.  I&#39;m guessing either she was very inexperienced, or the place was incredibly short staffed.  We came around 2:00 p.m., and they close after lunch at 3:00 p.m. until they open for dinner starting at 5:00 p.m.  Their hours are 11:00 to 3:00 for lunch, and 5:00 to 9:00 for dinner.  

Other than the lack of attention, the waitress seemed to be very nice, and otherwise helpful.  As for the food I was served, for the most part, I liked it.  

With our Groupon, my wife and I were able to try the Thai Egg Roll which is three pieces for $4.95, and, except for the egg, vegetarian.  We also had the Pad Eggplant Delight, the Pad Ka Tiem, the Pad Thai Lunch, and the Pad Woon Sen.  

1)  Thai Egg Roll - They were pretty good served with a nice, mild sweet and sour sauce.  They were about the length of my middle finger, but double the width.  I liked that they neither too greasy, or too crisp.  Just about right for my tastes, except that they could have been warmer.  Mine were almost room temperature.  

2)  Pad Eggplant Delight - My wife likes Eggplant, so she ordered this.  It is supposed to come with chicken, but we don&#39;t eat meat, so the restaurant happily substituted tofu.  That may have affected the flavor of the dish.  I do not know.  I do not like eggplant served that way, but it tasted good.  It seemed to have the same garlic sauce as the Pad Ka Tiem, but I cannot say for certain.  The sauce was a little thinner than I am used to, but it was good, and tasty.  

3)  Pad Ka Tiem - This one was my favorite.  I liked that most of the dishes on the menu gave customers the option of substituting tofu for the meat.  I had mine with tofu.  I liked that they used the firm tofu instead of the soft, silken tofu.  I also liked the garlic sauce, but, as I said before, it was a bit thin.  I mixed mine in with my rice, and added some of the hot peppers from the table, and it was spicy enough to make me happy.  I like &#34;hot&#34; Thai food more than the sweet, &#34;peanut&#34; Thai food.  With the addition of the peppers, that made this dish good for my tastes.  Some restaurants won&#39;t add the hot peppers because American tastes in heat vary so greatly.  I like that they just allowed me to spice it up my way.  That way, everyone is happy.  I would come back for this dish. 

4) Thai Pad Lunch - This is the dish for people who like the sweet, peanut Thai.  The noodles were good, and I liked the bean sprouts on top, but I did not care for the sweetness of the dish.  My wife took most of this home with here. 

5) Pad Woon Sen - This was my second favorite, but the glass noodles make it difficult to eat politely.  Without much sauce, the noodles stick together, and you end up almost having to pick up the whole pile of noodles to get any at all.  I do not know if that is the way it is supposed to be, but it seemed to me to need more sauce.  The flavors were good, and the noodles were nice.  If you like noodles, this might be a dish for you. 

Overall, it may be due to the time of day we came, but everything seemed to be served lukewarm.  Is that authentic?  I don&#39;t know, but I think everything would have tasted better if it were served hotter. 

For the record, all lunches on the menu are $7.95, unless otherwise marked, and all dinners are $9.95, unless otherwise marked.  If you want brown rice, they have it, but it will cost you $3.00 per entree.  They have spicy peppers on the table, and there is Sriracha sauce, so you don&#39;t have to worry about the food being spicy enough.  

If you dine here, be sure to grab a take-out menu on your way in, and grab your own utensils from around the corner just inside the door.  Go ahead and sit down if there is no one at the desk, and hope that she comes out before too long.  Right now, this place has no liquor license, but they do have good tea, both hot and iced.  You can expect a decent meal at a decent price, and, despite the number of restaurants in the area, you won&#39;t find anything quite like this anywhere else in the area."

We had good service and the food was pretty good. Different preparations than I&#39;m used to, but still good. We tried a curry dish, a noodle dish, soup, and a roll appetizer. Would I go back? I&#39;m not sure. It just wasn&#39;t a 5-star meal for me. I dock 2 stars because: 

1) Value (appetizers): The entrees are fairly priced and similarly sized compared to other Thai places I have visited. However, I didn&#39;t feel that way about our appetizer. We ordered the summer roll, which is $7 on its own. If you want to add shrimp (we did), you pay $2 more. I expected that we&#39;d get freshly rolled shrimp summer rolls. Instead, we got several pieces of a roll on a plate that seemed pre-made and were bland. On top of each roll &#34;piece,&#34; a shrimp was just laying there. You had to remove the shrimp, dip the roll in sauce, and then just eat the shrimp alone. It was comical to pay $9 for it. The tom ga was prepared different than I&#39;ve had other places but was still okay. We ordered it medium and it had NO spice whatsoever. Bummer.

 2. Spice: I love spicy Thai food (really, any spicy food) and it&#39;s always a let down when you&#39;re not allowed to order what you want. Our soup was as mild as milk and  nowhere near &#34;medium.&#34; I asked for more heat on my entree (asked if they could do &#34;medium hot&#34; instead of &#34;hot,&#34; since it was my first visit) and wasn&#39;t allowed to do so. There was no budging on the matter. I was permitted to order medium heat only. As expected, the food came out &#34;mild.&#34; it was a frustrating experience.

The other yelpers seemed to really like this place, and I&#39;m bummed I can&#39;t agree with them. Perhaps my experience was an isolated incident, and hopefully it was."

We went in before they even had a sign up and was warmly greeted as we walked in.  The place has new restaurant smell but that is quickly masked by delicious steam Thai dishes. 

Everything we had was great and a little on the spicy side.  I like spice but I think their &#39;medium&#39; is &#39;hot&#39; anywhere else. IMHO. 
Garlic chicken is really good, the sauce is addictive.

The main course was a mix of Pad Thai, Pad Prig Pow, vegetable fried rice and Three Flavor Fish. The Pad Thai and Pad Prig Pow were delightful.

We came in on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving without a reservation. The only table available was the high table, which was fine except that we had an infant in a car set. We were trying to make it work, but space-wise it was a little awkward. After about 5 minutes, the staff came over to us and told us we could move to a different table which was far more accommodating for our situation.

Then the food came out and that was absolutely delicious. We ordered the pancetta, bread, and beets and all were fabulous. I could&#39;ve had the pancetta as a meal in itself.

For the main course, we ordered the steak, duck, halibut, and lamb. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the halibut - it didn&#39;t have much flavor and could have used  more of a sauce. The other three, however, were decadent. The duck melted in my mouth and the steak was so tender and flavorful.

The experience was great and I highly recommend giving the place a try."

We had outstanding from the moment we walked in. The service was phenomenal. They knew that we were attending the theater afterward so they made sure to bring everything out in a timely fashion. 

The &#34;amuse&#34; at the beginning of our meal was so tantalizing, we couldn&#39;t wait for the main course! The bread basket is also very much worth the $4. We could have filled up on that alone. We enjoyed all three of the different spreads that accompanied our bread.  Heavenly! The waitress recommended the house side salad prior to my meal. I&#39;m glad she did.  It was so fresh and delicious. For the main course, I ordered the sea scallops.  Everything on the plate complemented each other very well. And the presentation on the plate was a work of art. My friend ordered the Little Gem salad and the soup for her meal. She kept saying &#34;wow&#34; during her meal, as well. For dessert, we split the dark chocolate mousse.  It was divine!

As a very pleasant surprise after our meal, we received a discount because we were going to the theater. We were unaware of that perk (wow!). We also received two free drink coupons for the theater. As if everything else wasn&#39;t already beyond perfection!  What a lovely way to spend a Sunday evening.  We kept saying we need to go back and try other entrees.  We&#39;ll also be going back for brunch. 

My friend said to me at dinner that she is amazed to find such a gem in Golden. We are very fortunate to have such a high quality restaurant so close to home.  Wow! Wow! Wow!"

The interior is quite spacious with a rustic vibe very suitable for Golden. The food is fantastic and the service is gracious.

The lunch menu had a wide variety of choices including a nice mix of salads, sandwiches, and entrees. I had the daily fresh pasta which was a squash ravioli with duck confit. It was absolutely delicious with many complementary but intense flavors. The portion of duck meat was very generous (this was not mixed into the ravioli filling, but served on top of the raviolis), but I did wish for two or three more raviolis in the dish.

My friend was not in the mood for a heavy lunch, so the kitchen put together a very nice vegetarian plate for her with the olive oil mashed potatoes and a side salad. She thought this was wonderful, particularly the relish that came with the potatoes, and gobbled up every bit.

I tried the baked chocolate mousse for dessert. This was amazing--one of the best desserts I have ever had. The chocolate was light and fluffy, but with just a bit of a fudge consistency and flavor. The accompanying vanilla bean ice cream and passion fruit (I think) coulis blended perfectly with the chocolate.

Our waitress was extremely kind, helpful, and knowledgeable which made the meal a particular pleasure."

I remember it was one of those kinds of dishes that was so good you&#39;d like to lick the plate (tempted, but refrained).

This is a very small restaurant and I&#39;m sure a reservation would be a smart idea for dinner (we didn&#39;t have a problem at lunch time, although it was mid-week).

I had the bangers and mash, my dining partners had the kids french toast and the potato pancakes and even though each meal was perfectly cooked, strange choices left a sour note. The biggest of these complaints being the, (homemade?,) sausage. which were crumbly on the inside and rather mealy on the tongue. killing any sense of moisture and sadly allot of the taste.

I had the smoked salmon Benedict which I have a hard time not ordering when its on a menu. The hollandaise was lemon forward and not too heavy as it came be. The accompanying salad was seasoned perfectly. The plate of food was generous but not gigantic and I left feeling satisfied but not heavy.

The place was packed when we arrived which immediately made me realize it was going to be good! There are more options in Golden now but Abejas is a must try. Their were 4 of us - we had some of their amazing cocktails, a bottle of wine recommended by our waitress- which was spot on based on what we told her we liked.   And then the food! Oh my, the complex flavors and presentation kept you wanting more. Some of my favorites were the pancetta, octopus and beets to start. We chose the flank steak and halibut as our main dishes and I don&#39;t know which I liked more. To top off the evening we had the French press coffee with chocolate mousse. Amazing experience all around! Kudos to Brandon - taking extra care of our table made it extra special. We will be back!"

It exceeded my expectations   While I&#39;m a fan and lover of everything Golden and all about a good burger at a no-frill bar, one thing I&#39;ve always felt was missing from the town is an innovative restaurant with high quality, fresh, creative dishes, seasonal menus, and a cocktail menu that only a true mixologist could concoct.  Add in a cozy atmosphere and a phenomenal wait staff, and you&#39;ve got Abejas. It&#39;s exactly what Golden needed, so first off, THANK YOU for bringing this caliber of restaurant to town!

 Everything we tried on the menu was fantastic.  I was mesmerized by the menu itself and got lost in reading the descriptions of the dishes.   The appetizers were as delicious as they were creative and artistic, and the entrees were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We&#39;re talking emphasis to detail here- and feeling like special attention went into each plate.  We&#39;re also talking quality- nothing is being submerged in a deep fryer, or re-heated in a microwave.  It&#39;s hard to recommend anything specifically when everything you had was fantastic- so I&#39;d say order away and enjoy the experience!  We has the Garlic &amp; Saffron Soup and Pancetta (my favorite of everything I tried) to start, and the flank steak and pork as our entrees.  

It wasn&#39;t just the presentation and the food itself, but what really made the experience great was the fantastic level of service. The staff are professionals, who truly know their food and menus, and who you honestly felt enjoyed their jobs.  It came through in how the courses were presented. We were also lucky enough to meet one of the owners while there and learn a bit more about the opening of Abejas.  The guys who own the restaurant are culinary gurus and geniuses themselves.  It&#39;s obvious that they&#39;re passionate about the food and experience they&#39;re bringing to the town of golden.  Fantastic food, great atmosphere, awesome service, top-notch management and ownership- more than enough reasons to go back! ABEJAS is EXACTLY was Golden needed!"

I was an instant fan of the food and the atmosphere are two of my favorite things.  

I have booked a few client dinners here over the last several months, and they have been very accommodating when the party has been rather large in such a small space.  I also enjoy the seasonal menu changes, as this keeps things fresh for both myself and any clients my company might host here.  

The staff are great and extremely knowledgable and I will continue to be a patron."
abejas-golden,Ashley B.,5wQrUNttU_OWWNo9N3Gq6w,"Golden, CO",1,1,0,534,14,ookQopt2w4jY4EGny29YlQ,4.0,2015-09-04,"As we sat finishing our meal, I remarked to my husband, &#34;wow...I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re having a semi-fancy, bistro meal in Golden.&#34; How it took this long to get this style of restaurant in this (not that small) town, is amazing to me. It&#39;s about time. Abejas is a very small restaurant that fills up quickly; we got a reservation the same afternoon but I would recommend a reservation. The host, it is worth noting, seemed out of place; too young and not enough fine(r) dining experience. She was lackluster on the phone, and even more so in person, telling us we&#39;d &#34;have to wait 10 minutes&#34; for our reservation, without even issuing an apology. Thankfully the manager/owner checked in with us, but the host continued to be somewhat annoying throughout our meal, literally drumming along with her pen with the (out of place) overhead music as we tried to have a conversation. 

They still have some nuances of timing and service to work out; took a few minutes to be greeted and our server, although very sweet, needed to check on pairings and wine flavor profiles. Despite the owner offering us a drink and giving us a minute to decide, they never actually checked in with us again or at any point, despite walking by our table with empty drinks and looking at them several times. 

The food, thankfully, is quite good, if slightly overpriced. We tried the prawn and corn tortellini, which was by far the weakest dish we tried. The edges of the pasta were quite tough, the sauce was a little perplexing and we were not given a spoon, but strangest of all the filling of the tortellini was also outside the tortellini as accompaniment. This was not bad, but it was a bit unusual. The prawns were very well cooked but having almost-raw corn inside tortellini was a bit off-putting. This dish was $12, which seemed quite high for only 3 tortellini. Also, our appetizer came out within 5 minutes of ordering, which made us feel a bit rushed, and threw off the pacing of our wines and courses, as the food arrived before our wine, and the appetizer arrived before our amuse bouche. Our amuse was eggplant with garlic aioli, which was very good but a bit too plentiful, with toasted oats and black rice. We both enjoyed it but were confused about its placement in the flow of the meal. 

Our mains were the pork chop with greens, polenta, and sultana and peach chutney ($24). It was a very large bone-in portion, but without the bone and fat it was a fairly typical portion. It was a very, very well cooked and seasoned dish and my husband really enjoyed it. The tempernilo also went quite well with it. I ordered the mussels special, and was served the &#34;lunch&#34; portion according to our receipt, which was $14. I&#39;m glad it was only $14, because I received 22 mussels (but one was empty and one was closed), 1/4 cup of broth, and 3 pieces of bread. The mussels were good, not great, almost tepid, and strangely flavored with mint. Mint is not a flavor I anticipate in a typical white wine application for mussels; it grew on me as I ate but was unexpected. I was skeptical of the small amount of broth but it ended up being enough for the bread and I was satisfied overall, especially with a lower price point. After consulting in the back, our server also gave a good recommendation and I really enjoyed my wine. 

We chose not to partake in dessert; the options were not that interesting despite one or two intriguing ideas. Unfortunately, a very common dessert with one interesting component is just not enough to convince people, I don&#39;t think. Desserts are often such a weakness for restaurants in Denver- the dessert menu has to be very convincing for us to bother trying it. Two mains, an appetizer, and four drinks cost around $95, which my husband remarked felt just a bit too high. I would agree, but I would add that there is nothing else of this type in Golden, and honestly they could charge more and probably get away with it. The takeaway here is they make good food, with good flavors, with decent service that needs a bit more finesse. Having a restaurant like this within a 5 minute drive is refreshing, and I have no doubt we&#39;ll return."

We had the beets and the lamb entree. Excellent! We loved our server, too. She was very sweet and down to earth.

This is the best restaurant I have had the privilege of eating at in golden or Denver for that matter. They do small plates but for the four of us that started the meal then my cousins husband who joined us mid meal we all were surprised at the degree of quality and deliciousness this dinner was! Even my father who is 87 years old and not the most patient for being served enjoyed the European style of service. An exceptionally wonderful new restaurant for Denver! I can&#39;t wait to come back and try their other dishes as well as their brunch

Have had one hostess who seemed to be having a bad day and wasn&#39;t so friendly, but the waitress more than made up for that with tremendous service. 
The starters were all great with very unique flavors - not your standard fair. Wife had the soup, which I forget the name, and I am not a soup guy but it was fantastic. I&#39;ve had the lamb shank and scallops and both were very flavorful and well prepared.
Cocktail menu was creative and tasty.
It is somewhat pricey, but for 2 starters, 2 entrees and a drinks for two about ~$120 (no tip), probably reasonable given the quality and distinctive flavors."

I had the mushroom, squash scramble. It was very tasty, with a lot of mushrooms. It came with potatoes, greens, and toast. I especially liked the greens, they were simple and very delicious. My husband had the cheddar biscuits and gravy. His plate was licked clean. We also ordered fresh fruit, and it was fresh and delicious. The fruit was arranged beautifully, with a wide variety to nimble on. We will be back!!"

Abejas was the first restaurant in the Golden area that I&#39;ve found to embrace this concept. Maybe I&#39;m not looking hard enough, I am a college student eating dorm food most of the time, but my expectations were more than exceeded. 

I started with the baked pancetta and roasted beet and plum small plates. The baked pancetta was probably one of the best things I&#39;ve had in a while- not that college cafeteria food is ever good. The dish surpassed my expectations and revived my hope in food. The roasted beet and plum plate was super fresh and yummy. The plate contained a gorgeous goat cheese that I wish I could have every day. 

For the main plate, I ordered the seared sea scallops. The quality of the scallops on the plate blew me away. They were better than some of the scallops I&#39;ve had at the shore. Whoever supplies them is doing a stellar job. That being said, the flavored put on the plate complimented the quality of the protein. This is one of those places where you&#39;re not exactly sure what everything is on the plate, but you&#39;re more than happy eating it."

Nelson our waiter was great. He treated us well and we ended up with some amazing bread complimented with a pumpkin curry purée (better than butter) that any vegan would adore. I&#39;m not a vegan. We were also treated to some amazing heirloom tomatoes with watermelon, in-house burrata and a cute little phyllo dough stuffed goat cheese roll. The tomatoes were perfectly sweated with salt. You don&#39;t need to add anything to the dishes here. 

On to the food we ordered... I can&#39;t remember everything but I remember this...I&#39;ve never had such thick slabs of pancetta and the in-house duck pastrami with the roasted beets was fabu. Close your eyes and make noise fabulous. Oh I could go on and on. There were even naughty bits...maybe some red wine deglazed nuggets of wonderment. Not sure. 

For main courses we had lamb shank and duck breast. Duck breast with thick crispy fat sweaters. Forbidden black rice that made think...hmmm...provincial...nutty... Good enough to shove a fork of rice in my man&#39;s mouth without his assent. My husband&#39;s lamb shank was melt-in-your-mouth as well, but I was too busy hanging with my duck to put full attention to his plate. 

So after a couple of cocktails and freebies we were pretty full, but when Nelson presented the dessert menu he had me at Creme Fraiche Frosting. I can&#39;t explain the dessert other than it was carrot cake and something that got better with every bite, versus the taste buds&#39; propensity to dull itself into a dish. It had something to do with little bits of caramel, some sort of crunchy something and a yummy vanilla bean ice cream. It wasn&#39;t a super sweet dish but the ice cream perfectly complimented the Creme Fraiche. 

I could go on and on but I need to find some elastic waist pants so I can more comfortably bask in the glory that is my utmost gratitude to have a restaurant like this 2.5 blocks from home. 

Yay....."

It is possibly the best meal we have had in the fifteen or so restaurants we tried in Golden over the past few weeks.

We started with the corn and prawn tortellini small plate. The flavor was excellent,  but the protruding edges of the house-made tortellini were undercooked and crunchy. That was the only disappointment of the meal.

My companion chose the pork (butcher&#39;s choice). It was cooked to perfection, resting on house - made polenta, with sweet and sour dates. I had off - the - bone lamb with the most amazing carrots and sugar snap peas. The lamb was absolutely tender and roasted perfectly. The combination of flavors was exquisite. 

We shared a fig and honey semifreddo for dessert, just the right sweet touch to end our meal.

Livia did a great job taking care of us during our dinner. She was attentive and knowledgeable, and if she didn&#39;t know the answers to my many questions, she found out and let me know what the answer was.
We started out with the Bibb lettuce salad, Foie Gras surrounded in pig terrine, that came with walnut bread, and beet salad, that had 3 types of beets, And  this amazing house made duck pastrami. All were creatively presented, (entrees included), and had mouth watering  flavor combinations that you&#39;d normally would  find in Michelin star restaurants. (All that was missing was fancy plates and the $$$$$ decor) 
For our Entrées, we enjoyed the gnocchi&#39;s and Halibut. Gnocchi&#39;s are one of my husbands favorites, these were fresh, soft and were finished with a light seared crust, that gave them a  perfect texture. My halibut had fresh porcini  mushrooms from Oregon and crisp fingerling potatoes, Fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned.
For dessert, my husband had the ice cream trio, and I enjoyed the dark chocolate mousse that were a perfect ending to a most satisfying meal, that had me smiling the entire time.
Chef Nick came out to say hello, so we were able to tell him of what a fabulous job he did along with their staff. 
The Bee&#39;s owners,(Brandon and Barry)hit a home run when they hired Chef Nick! His artistry, talent, creativity  and passion, is unmistakable in every delightful dish. Looking forward to our next meal at Abejas."

I&#39;m visiting Golden for work and I was looking for a local restaurant with a good vibe for dinner on my own. After strolling past the touristy neon bars and pizza joints on the Main Street, I decided to stroll down a side street and back to my car in order to be lazy and grab food at the hotel lobby. That&#39;s when I walked past this cute place. The menu looked amazing so I decided to try it out. I was greeted with a smile and escorted to a tall table near the bar. The place had what I&#39;d describe as an industrial farmhouse feel to it. My waitress, Kelly was super friendly and attentive. I ordered a beer from a Colorado brewery. (No, not THAT brewery down the way.) I was treated to an amuse ( small taster) that was delicious! I then had the carrot almond soup that was served in a little pitcher and poured into a bowl in front of me. I felt so special! What a neat touch! I had the scallops for dinner and they were perfect. I saved just a little bit of room and had the fig semi freddo for dessert. Wow! A perfect amount of sweet. 
I would highly recommend this lovely local restaurant to anyone and hope I get the chance to go back soon."

I&#39;ve been there twice.  First time I had a salad and scallops.  The salad was gritty.  It had a texture like it was unwashed.  I don&#39;t know if it was by design or accident, but I didn&#39;t care for it.  The scallops were a punch in the face of salt.  My mother-in-law couldn&#39;t eat hers.  I was bound and determined to conquer it.  

The ambiance is beautiful and the service was great.  I&#39;m encouraged that they&#39;re raising the bar on dining in Golden and I think that my food experience may be growing pains.

However, at this price point it is probably the most expensive restaurant in Golden.  At that level I expect perfection.  I think that as it settles in, it will get there.   However, based on my n=2 experience and the cost/value, I look elsewhere first."

Every single thing we ate was fantastic. I had the Halibut and it was the most perfectly cooked piece of fish I&#39;ve ever had. It was so moist and tender it was like butter. On top of all the amazing food we received excellent service. Kelly was our server who brought us a complimentary small plate which was a wonderful Beet and Plum salad that was delicious. We requested to speak with the Chef (Nick) which we rarely do, who brought us a wonderful Aperitif before we ordered dessert. He originates from San Francisco and clearly is a very talented creative Chef. I should add that every plate we had was presented with different micro greens and little floral buds that made each dish beautiful. I am excite to have found this amazing little gem. Thank you so much for giving us a wonderful experience."

The server was knowledgable and engaging but the most telling attribute was how obviously proud and excited she was to be working there. And for good reason. The cocktails were unique and refreshing. I had the lamb shank and my wife ordered a pork loin which . My wife offered me a bite of the pork (incredible) and when I looked down to return the favor I realized I ate the entire Lamb dish without sharing. I just unconsciously devoured it.

The meat was tender and the skin was crispy. I frequently order duck at restaurants, and I can say this is my favorite since the fabled duck entree at Full Moon Grill in Boulder (now closed for many years). My husband had the lamb, which was also quite good. We will be coming back. My only (slight) criticism is that our server presented and went through the dessert choices while my husband was still eating his entree--that felt a bit rushed. She later stated she was not rushing us, so I think she caught on. Despite that, it was overall a fabulous meal!"

We came here based on a rave review from my boyfriend&#39;s sister, who enjoyed their brunch menu several days earlier. I was immediately impressed from the moment I opened the front door. The decor suggested that we were walking into a New American bistro. We were greeted right away by our fabulous server, Livia, who sat us in one of the booths. Right away, she explained the items on the menu, including the cocktails. Gin being my favorite, I opted for the Damson Gin Fizz, which was phenomenal. My boyfriend had the Howling Wolf beer and his sister had their house Pinot Noir. It&#39;s suggested that you select a few of the small plates to start because each entree is handcrafted individually. We choose the crispy kale salad and the salmon crudo. The salad was amazing and the lemon vinaigrette paired perfectly with the fresh pear and parmesan toppings. However, the star of the evening was definitely my entree! I chose the bone out lamb shank and O.M.G. I&#39;ve never tasted lamb so tender and succulent! It was accompanied with a wild mushroom and lentil side, topped with a sweet glaze. The rest of my party enjoyed the duck breast, flat iron steak, black cod and sea scallops . The duck was also a delight, with a flaky crispy shell that was definitely one for the books! Following dinner, we enjoyed local coffee that was presented in a table French press and the dark chocolate mousse. Overall, our meal was definitely a memorable one. What else can I say? Golden has been waiting for a restaurant of this caliber to emerge and I&#39;m so glad it did!"

Went to Abejas for an earlier-than-usual lunch at 11:30am; was seated immediately at a table for 4 (we had a party of three). I had the Tuna Melt Sandwich (it&#39;s good - it has Gruyere cheese and served on marble rye bread) for $11, which sounds a *little* expensive for a sandwich, but it comes with a side salad and was very delicious. Was informed later by the server that the tuna is cooked in the kitchen, then crumbled/mixed into tuna salad (none of the Star-Kist kind of action). Who thought you could have a pleasant, reasonably-priced lunch in the middle of Golden? Would recommend the restaurant&#39;s nice ambiance for dinner, which will probably be my next visit.

Skip the lines in Denver! You can drive here, eat one of the best brunches of your life, and get back to town before your name is even called at Snooze.

As a local Golden resident, I was excited a farm-to-table restaurant had come to town, and close to my house. With a place that has climbing rope (poorly strung, I might add) for decor: I was not expecting a side of snob with my food. The service notwithstanding, I was hoping the food would make up for it: wrong again. I ordered the bangers and mash, and it ranks as one of the smallest portions of food I have ever received at a restaurant (and I&#39;m a global traveler, including infamous small portions served in Europe). The person I was with ordered the omelet, and had at least 3x the amount of food I had, so at least that was satisfactory. Prices are high, portions are too small, and when I frequently walk by this place: I keep on walking and frequent other local establishments in Golden."

Parking was very easy, free on street parking right across from the restaurant. The wait staff was very helpful and clearly very passionate about their jobs. They were the highlight of the night for us. Our waitress was charming, knew the menu backwards and forwards, and was extremely patient with my girlfriends indecisiveness. The bartender Tao was especially helpful and made all my drinks to taste. She made a bourbon, cherry, chocolate cocktail that was absolutely exceptional...I hope to see on the menu during our next visit. The food was well priced and our portions were larger than expected and very satisfying. The great quality and preperation for the price point is another thing that will make us come back.

The ambiance is really great--loved how they decorated and the size of it. Overall, it was enjoyable but we weren&#39;t blown away. It&#39;s only been open for a hot minute and there were a few things that need to be tweaked.

--every dish we got was either luke warm or almost cold. the food and the plate. 
--one dish we got was the scallop dish which was really delicious but needed a lot more of the pesto sauce on it. it left you constantly feeling like each bite wasn&#39;t enough because the sauce was almost gone after one scallop. 
-Also got the tortellini. Something needs to be added to this dish---4 tortellini, the sauce was pretty tasty but we could tell the tortellini wasn&#39;t totally made to order. the tops of them were very dry and weren&#39;t sauced before they gave us the plate. they were almost hard. 
-carrot cake was DELISH
-personally, if someone has a special bread basket on your menu i think it should be a pretty damn good one. the spreads they had were actually great (juniper olive oil, cauliflower hummus and yummy butter) but the bread was absolutely non big deal (and again, cold). I think this is an easy area to fix.

We will go back and i wish it a TON of success but it definitely needs to help in a few areas. Like I said, SUPER awesome it&#39;s here in Golden!"

A few comments I hope management see&#39;s.  
Need Side Dishes to accompany Main Courses: 
(ex; Greens, Broch-Colli_etc.  Potato- Scalloped, Sweet, etc.- something!!!) 

Also Salad very good, but since produce is farm to table would appreciate a good mixed greens with assorted vegetables w/ creamy style dressing.

Need to offer Ice Cream."

That is not a complaint but advise because you should not rush a meal of this quality.  Take your time to think about what your are eating.  We had a very memorable meal here last night.  There are some really talented people in the kitchen whose creativity and attention to detail are a joy to experience.  We especially liked the contrasts of flavors and textures woven into every dish.  For example, the goat cheese in phyllo with the beet and plum salad is just one example of the best ingredients brilliantly presented.  The smoothest, creamiest cheese in ultra crisp pastry... Don&#39;t know how it was done.  A flower made of ultra thin slices of Tete De Moine formed into a trumpet lilly was amazing along side the gnocchi with crunchy walnuts in a nice brown butter.  A scant few chopped pistachios hiding beneath perfectly seared scallops was a nice surprise.  The wine list is diverse with fair markups and the service is attentive.  My only negative comment is the too small wooden tables are so rustic and uneven so you have to be careful about setting down your wine glass and the chairs are uncomfortable so make it a table of four and ask for a booth."

Duck Pastrami, Radicchio, Phyllo Wrapped Goat Cheese, Lavender - a new favorite - great balance
The only reason this rating is a 4 instead of a 5 is when it came down to the main course - 
Seared Sea Scallops
Saffron-Braised Fennel, Leeks, Grapefruit, Castelvetrano Olives
It was under cooked and kind of took the sails out the end of the meal -

Seems like we have been waiting forever for Golden to get a really nice dinner restaurant. But alas Abejas manages to fall short of the hype but not by much. Restaurant week had us bringing the inlaws out and early. The starters and mains were truly lovely! (Able to understand the hype). We ordered one of everything with double on the hamachi crudo. Our server let us know that the portions were large enough to share however this was definitely NOT the case. For entrees we skipped the duck confit as it is offered on the lunch menu and tried the bass, chicken with faro and the gnocchi. The food was well seasoned, perfectly cooked and tasty with an overall nice presentation. The &#34;sides&#34; were simply more of a garnish. Best example of this was the chicken dish which had only 2 table spoons of perfectly seasoned faro. Not that one needs a huge pile but the portion ratio to chicken breast just seemed off. Where Abejas falls woefully short is in the dessert realm. Both offerings were sadly sadly underwhelming and misrepresented. Even more disappointing our server was completely aware and did not bother to mention anything. The chocolate mousse was an overworked hard brick of chocolate more like a dense flourless cake. The cheese cake was more &#34;mousse&#34; like complete with soggy graham cracker crust. With two solid courses beforehand the expectation for the third was high. I&#39;d say from our restaurant week experience it was clear that Abejas was participating but with a level of disinterest. The impression was for &#34;30 bucks you got what you came for so don&#39;t complain&#34; which may be a close enough experience to come back and try again at a full price time. We will go back for another try but will not be ordering dessert."

This place was absolutely terrible- and expensive terrible. I ordered a crab salad.   What I got was a large salad of shredded cabbage, 4 half-inch cubes of baked squash,3 or 4 minuscule orange pieces, 5 or 6 pieces of mixed greens and less than a teaspoon of crab.  I had to search diligently to find the crab. I could detect no dressing at all.  There were no rolls, no crackers ,couldn&#39;t even add salt and pepper as there was none on the table, no condiments, nothing. My friends ordered the pasta of the day and their servings were not much more than a cup full.  Go around the corner to the Table Mountain Inn.  The food is exceptional, and a good value for the money. I will not ever return to Abejas to buy an $11.00 bowl of shredded cabbage.  This is not excellent cuisine, it is ridiculous."

No exaj, I think I have probably ordered here upwards of 20 times, and have to say that the food is consistent across all items of the menu that I have explored. 

Now lets talk turkey, ehum, or egg roll rather. 

PROs:
1. Consistent &amp; Quality - like I said, everything I have tried has been exceptional (recommendations below). Veggies are super fresh too, and steamed to perfection. 

2. Convenient - located right in he Mayflower shopping area with dry cleaners, liq store, grocery, etc. Sure makes it easy to knock out other errands when you pick up. 

3. Customer service - all the folks are super friendly and seem happy to be cooking/serving for you.

4. Easily the most important: CHILI OIL is standard with every order, which I love. 


CONs:
1. Watch your wallet - Chinese food is traditionally relatively affordable. If you can get out of here with spending under 30 bones for 2 - my hats off to you. 

2. They skimp on the white rice. If you order two entrees chances are you will only get one like box of rice, so be sure to clarify when you order so you get 2 whi ri. 

Recommedations:
1. BBQ Pork 
2. Seasame Tofu
3. Egg Rolls 
4. Chicken Shacha"

I really enjoyed their sesame chicken and crab wontons. I think my favorite dish from them is their chicken lo mein. The chicken is all white meat and is cooked perfectly. I have to always get an order of their crab wontons. You can get them baked or fried. I just go with the fried option. They taste great. Now the prices are a little higher than other places.

I&#39;m not an expert on Asian foods and I don&#39;t know how authentic the food at Little Dragon is.  However, I do like to get fresh food that is good for me.  The food at Little Dragon is always fresh and refreshing.  I don&#39;t feel overfilled after eating their food, and I feel like I had a decent, nutritious meal.

Menu options are typical for an Asian restaurant:  kung pao, garlic sauce, Mongolian sauce, etc, with a protein.  Thing is, at Little Dragon, the Asian menu staples just seem better.   And they have some pretty cool creations of their own.  Vegetarian Eel!  Peace Not War Won Ton!

Little Dragon uses fresh ingredients and they actually try to maintain the flavor of the food through the cooking process.  It works.  They use whole chunks of vegetables and big chunks of tofu including big carrot slices, whole broccoli florets and whole mushrooms.  The vegetables actually taste like vegetables.

The fried entrees are just cooked enough to be done but not so much so that the flavor is lost.  They don&#39;t kill the food by over frying it.  

And they don&#39;t use too much salt to flavor the food.  I&#39;ve had meals with meat and also vegetarian meals.  They are equally as good.

The staff are even considerate enough to put a piece of cardboard in the bottom of the bag on takeout orders.   That means your food travels home without tipping over.  (Who hasn&#39;t had a container of won-ton soup tip over in the bag on the way home?)

Little Dragon pays attention to the details and it shows in the quality of the food.

I agree with the aggregate rating.  The food is four-star food, but the attention to detail gives them an extra star."

*They put the sweet and sour sauce in separate container for the take out order - a veteran move by a restaurant that cares about a quality experience. 
*Kept the cashews out of another meat dish - same conclusion
*Very friendly engaging service and I love being able to see the kitchen, which looked clean and well run. They are also generous with requests, in my case extra chopsticks. There was plenty of soy sauce given. 
*Only negative result - the lo mein did not taste right to me. It may be a different kind of noodle than what I&#39;m used to.

Bottom line - I like this place. They seem interested in quality and I thought 2 of the 3 dishes were really good. The disparity of opinion may come down to what dish you had. It&#39;s worth it to try some dishes here and find what you like because the restaurant itself is a keeper!"

After reading a series a good reviews, I was willing to take a chance on take-out. 

Sadly my search for decent Chinese food in Denver continues. I am totally shocked by all of these positive reviews! Is it possible that most have never had really good Chinese so this is all they know to be...? 

I ordered Bbq pork fried rice, Wor Wonton soup, and Triple Delight Chow Fun so I got a variety of dishes. 

The soup was watered down and quite bland. The veggies were fresh and crisp, but this soup totally lacked flavor. 

The bbq pork fried rice was awful! The pork was dry, unseasoned, and totally flavorless. The only highlight was that it wasn&#39;t oily or greasy, but it also didn&#39;t have much taste. And that&#39;s plain sad. What&#39;s better than a yummy fried rice?!? This isn&#39;t  the yummy kind! 

The trend continued with the triple delight chow fun... The noodles were dry, mostly stuck together, and appeared undercooked. Again this dish was so incredibly bland all I could do is laugh or just drown it in soy sauce. I choose to laugh and just stop forcing myself to eat this horrible dish. 

I&#39;m not sure if I am missing something here, but Chinese food should be savory, salty, and flavorful. This food was just the opposite-- dry, bland, and totally lacking of any flavor! 

Sadly in this town of many great restaurants and cuisines, finding a truly good Chinese place is a challenging task."

We just moved into the neighborhood, and in the process of unpacking, we needed some easy dinners for a few nights.  Little Dragon is located in the strip mall in the parking lot of King Sooper&#39;s.  

We walked in on a weeknight and saw two patrons waiting for to-go orders.  The kitchen was hopping and those guys were working hard!  The man at the front who manned the cashier was incredibly friendly.  He said he&#39;d be right with us, gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, and even made a few recommendations.  One of the women waiting for her order recommended the Kung Pao Chicken, saying it is her go to meal as she lives nearby.  

We ordered the orange chicken, kung pao beef, and an order of crab wontons and went for a short walk.  We were told our order would be ready in 10-15 minutes...and it was!

The results?  The portions were absolutely huge--both my husband and I had leftovers for the next day at work.  The quality was delicious, for Chinese take out food.  It&#39;s not going to knock your socks off, but it&#39;s legit.  Greasy, yes.  But what would you expect?

It sounds like King Sooper&#39;s is their &#34;landlord&#34; and they are unsure about renewing their lease.

Little Dragon offered everything Sir Nicholas, Little Man E, and I could want from Chinese dinner.

At this point I believe they have too much business and don&#39;t f&#39;ing care about service
Or customers. This is the last time I am going to place an order here."

We especially like their sesame chicken and friend rice. We also have tried their drunken noodles and like them. They&#39;re slightly more expensive than other options in town, but we think the food is fresh and worth paying a little more for. 

One note as tonight was our first time ordering delivery, they do charge a delivery fee. We just happened to notice a $3 Delivery fee on the itemized receipt tonight.  It&#39;s not a big deal, but I made the assumption that the delivery was free as most similar restaurants are and wanted others to know this as well. Delivery and/or Carry Out are your only real options as they don&#39;t have seating at the restaurant."

&#34;Our&#34; Chinese restaurant closed about a year and a half ago, and we have been searching for a new place. We have found it! The kids got sweet and sour chicken, and loved it. My husband got beef and broccoli, and loved it. I got Kung Pao shrimp, and you guessed it, LOVED IT. The wonton and hot and sour soup were amazing, and my hubbie loved the Crab wontons as well.

For my experience with this Chinese take out and yes just a take out. Unfriendly staff food quality was poor and smelled like rotten urine as the staff assured me it was fine my guest wanted to puke and said it was the worse smell she had ever smelled. Priced to high and they also need a lesson on how to make GSO&#39;s Chicken. If you think this is awesome Chinese then you need to make it to the east coast. Will never go back. Save your money!"

My dad loved the chicken wings- the breading they use is really good.

We got singapore mei fun and lemongrass chicken. The SMF were litterally some of the best we&#39;ve had - no oily orange sauce, and lots of good stuff in it. The chicken was unique and well balanced.

Will definitely order again!"

Their cheese wantons come with house hot mustard, their entrees aren&#39;t overly greasy and have a lot of flavor, and they even offer fried rice as an option for your side of rice. 

Come out of my way to drive here all the time now since I live too far away and am impatient. 

Give them a try! I hope they find a great new location since they have to move out of the strip mall. They will bring lots of traffic wherever they land in Denver- especially since their takeout volume seems so high! Hopefully they stay close.

Oh as a bonus, this is a gay-owned restaurant. The owners are so friendly and courteous! They were handing out tea and cookies while everyone waited for their food on a busy Friday night."

I have probably ordered from everywhere that delivers at least once.  When I am not out on the town trying new restaurants, I still want to explore Denver&#39;s restaurant scene, and what better way to do that then on your couch in your underwear!  

Though I have not tried to call and bribe to see if these calls will deliver in caphill, ordering from here is a must when I am my friends house in mayfair. The staff is super friendly, they can tell you what you ordered last time, and they are happy to make suggestions on what you might like to try that is new! 

Their potstickers are delicious and come in a chicken version.  I like this soooo much better then pork/ I don&#39;t find it as sketchy as some of the undecipherable meat that comes in dumplings at other places.  It just feels safe here. 

Their salt and pepper shrimp is also a favorite of mine.  Something I would again, never order because I would expect it to show p soggy and tastless... but these golden crispy fried shrimp are something from chinese delivery dreams. 

I intend to explore the menu more, but if you have not tried this place out, you must explore.  YUMMMMMO!"

They charged us more than $1200 for a take out order that was less than $30. The worker immediately saw the mistake and voided the charge. No big deal. Kind of funny, and he was very apologetic. But when the charge was on the credit card account, discovered after returning home, we called to investigate further, and the owner was terribly rude. Really stupid move. Lost a couple of longtime customers.

And now, in response, Little Dragon owner calls her former customer &#34;delusional.&#34; Again, our problem wasn&#39;t with the original mistake. It was with the owner&#39;s attitude upon making sure the mistake was handled -- after all, the $1200 was showing up on our credit card.

I started at home with the spring rolls, meh. Average, they tasted pre made and didn&#39;t impress me at all. The won ton soup was large portion, good but it&#39;s not hard to mess up. Finally the chicken with broccoli was good. An extra $1 for brown rice (boo), but the dish over all was a large portion and tasty. Not overly greasy or anything you find at a hold in the wall.

After 2 visits, I have nothing but good things to say. The Mongolian Beef is delicious! And the best part? There are yukon gold potatoes in it! (I am a lover of all things potatoes and to have them mixed in - and wonderfully so - with the Mongolian Beef...well, BIG fan!) The veggie spring rolls and fried crab cheese wontons are at the top of my list for favorite appetizers and the chicken fried rice is also delicious! 

The store is very clean and the staff very friendly - offered me a cup of tea while I waited but really the food only took about 10 minutes.

Just some useful info: the restaurant does not open until 4 and its strictly a to-go/delivery place. We have done both carryout and delivery with good experiences for both. Pricing is about the norm for what I have seen - average meal with appetizer and 2 entrees will run you about $25. But there is plenty of food and we always have leftovers for lunch the next day."

Service over the phone was great. Patient, friendly and happy to answer any questions.

Delivery was super fast. The driver got lost, no surprise there. My sisters apartment complex is nutso.

It&#39;s fresh and delicious, I&#39;ve never been disappointed with any dish that I&#39;ve ordered.  My favorites are the kung pao beef and the Singapore noodles.  The portion sizes are hearty, and I often find myself drooling over Little Dragon leftovers a few days after my initial order.  

My craving turned into a full blown addiction after experiencing Little Dragon&#39;s incredible customer service.  They are polite on the phone, and have never once (despite an embarrassing amount of orders) messed up my order.  The delivery drivers are equally courteous, and usually arrive much sooner than the time quoted over the phone.  The owner, Mimi, is of the highest quality.  She is fiercely loyal to repeat customers, and frequently rewards my patronage with various free dishes.  

I&#39;ve tried several Chinese takeout places around Park Hill, and Little Dragon is far and above the best choice."

It&#39;s really small, with 2 tables for eating and mostly made for take out or delivery service.  The cashiers are friendly, nice and they make your food to order.  The menu is pretty large for a take out chinese place, with many different sauces to choose from.  I got the sesame chicken, which to my surprise was a very large portion!  It came with rice (fried or white) and spring rolls as well.  The chicken was pretty tasty with lots of sauce, tender.  The fried rice was also ok, nothing mixed in with the rice however.

Overall a decent place for a quick, large meal."

Been ordering delivery from Little Dragon since they have been open when I don&#39;t crave sushi.
The Good:
Chicken Wings are the best! You have to try them
Chinatown Style Barbecue Pork, great sauce  
The ingredients are a huge step above traditional Chinese places, the Chicken, Steak and Shrimp are way above what other places use.
Drunken Noodles: reminds me of when I was in China 
Mongolian: Anything is great love the potatoes as a traditional ingredient 
Cashew:  Chicken w/ honey glazed cashews yummy need a little more of them(hint) 
Salt &amp; Pepper: Chicken of Beef- can&#39;t find a fault 
The Gay guy who answers the phone and delivers (never let him go he&#39;s priceless) 

The bad:
Baked Crab Cheese wantons (not a fan) or any of them filling pockets are to small
Noticed they are using less of the meats in their offerings (hint)"

We went in on a Sunday afternoon.  Most of the restaurant tables were taken by large parties watching the games but we were seated in a booth as asked.  Our server was pretty prompt with our drink order and seemed pretty nice.  We were super surprised to find that this steakhouse reduced the menu and was mostly serving sandwiches and burgers.  They had $18 Sirloin and a $28 NY Strip.
My husband and I each ordered the sirloin which was served with a side and a salad.  We both ordered the Caesar, I had mashed potatoes and the hubs had a loaded baked potato. We also both ordered our steaks medium rare. 
Now maybe I&#39;m picky but when I&#39;m paying nearly $20 a meal I expect a certain amount of quality.  Once we placed our order we didn&#39;t see our server again until our food came out, which was brought out by someone else.  The steaks were visibly two very different sizes.  And they both had huge cuts right down the middle.  My husbands steak was rare while mine was borderline well.  The salad was served on the same plate and was drenched with dressing that caused the steak and potatoes to be drenched.  Before we could get one bite in our server refilled my husbands drink and was gone.  A time went by, and I had given up on trying to pick at the edible food on my plate, the waitress came back and took my plate never asking how the food was.  And some time later did the same to my husband.  She dropped our check and some other waitress ran our card and returned it.  I completely felt like our server felt guilty and was avoiding a confrontation.  We at no point had any intention of not paying because we didn&#39;t make it absolutely clear that we were unhappy to management.  However, we never even saw a manager.  And the one gal who could have been a manager was outside smoking with other servers on the patio nearly the entire time we were there. Overall, it was nothing special leaving me with zero desire to ever return."

It took over an hour to get our food and when we questioned the server about the wait time he got rude, defensive, and plain unprofessional. A friend actually had to ask him to stop being rude to us. When the food finally came out, everything was just BLAH. My soup seemed like it was sitting in the window for so long the top layer of the soup was just baked, after I peeled off that layer the soup was decent. My Brussels sprouts had a good flavor though. My fiance&#39;s &#34;medium&#34; burger was slopped together on a plate with no pink in the middle to be seen. A girlfriend&#39;s eggs Benedict has definitely seen better days... everything was just plopped on plates and slammed down to us. It was a horrible beginning to our day."

When the beer did arrive, the glass was chipped and glass chards we IN the beer! WTH, thank goodness I noticed before he took a drink. Food was good, the only reason I&#39;ve continued to come back. Then the bill comes. My $3 special martini was charged as $6. I asked about it cuz I pointed at the menu when I ordered it. She said the other lady, meaning waitress, told me there was an up charge for that. Well, she didn&#39;t so go ahead and argue with me cuz lady, I will never come back!

My friends bacon wrapped filet was very good. It came out medium and cut very easily. It needed a seasoning or a rub to enhance the taste.
My NY Strip was the big issue. First it was way over cooked. The worst part was that my steak smelled and tasted bad. Call it spoiled. It was really bad and we told our waitress that the kitchen might have issues if this steam and others off this cut.
The waitress disappeared and came back to tell us she credited our check. This was great but the fact the manager was nowhere to be seen shouts concern and implies that the manager knew about the state of that cut of steak.

But.... Over  the last 6-8 months they have really gone down hill. Food quality has been highly inconsistent and usually on the poor side.  
Other than the team behind the bar that have been there awhile the service is very spotty.  They have had 3-4 managers since the last good manager was there (Travis). Things ran smoothly then and food quality was quite good and consistent. 
I hope they get their &#34;groove&#34; back as I am going there less and less for anything more than a cold beer. 
It really does seem that the owners don&#39;t really care anymore, I mean the one of then front doors has been broken for 2 plus years?!?  The bar surface needs a good cleaning, a bit sticky... It&#39;s time for a bit of a refresh??

We lost power that night, right when I was about to start grilling a steak, so after the power not coming on for a half hour, decided to venture out and get some grub. I donate to CPR and they have a member card with different businesses offering BOGO and Dusty Boot was one of them. We got there and there was a few tables sat but nothing too crazy (except the one big table who was really, really loud--acoustics are not great in this place!) A girl greeted us and soon found out she was a server in training and would be shadowing with Michael. 

My fiancé ordered a steak, which the kitchen ended up over cooking his medium rare request, and Michael let us know and apologized. That made everything take a little longer and tables that came in after us left after us, so I was ready to get some food in my system. He loved his steak, chili and onion rings I ordered the BBQ Shrimp Tacos and they were a huge let down and really not like anything like described in the menu. The description made it sound like it would be really fresh packed with BBQ flavor. There was barely any shrimp, mostly tomatoes and cheese, neither which was mentioned in the description and there was no black beans which was listed on the menu. I love tomatoes and love cheese but just wanted something fresh and tasty and this wasn&#39;t it. The BBQ Crema sauce was pretty bland and I had to use some salt to flavor it up. I don&#39;t know if the menu has changed or if there was a miscommunication with the kitchen but the tacos weren&#39;t as described and honestly didn&#39;t taste good. Usually I would send something back but given the long day plus our puppy at home, really just wanted to eat and go home. 

Michael was really attentive, personable and an all-around awesome server. We really appreciated him and his service! But the food I ordered left a lot to be desired and not as described on the menu. If we didn&#39;t have a BOGO, I wouldn&#39;t com here, prices are jacked up for what you get. Don&#39;t order the BBQ Shrimp Tacos!"

Service can make or break a meal and in this case it helped tremendously because I would be hard-pressed to say the food will bring me back here.
I was surprised by how small &amp; cozy the inside of this place was. For some reason I thought it would be much bigger. We sat in the bar and, as I mentioned, got some of the best service from Mike. What can I say, when you know what you&#39;re doing, it shows. Unfortunately, the food just didn&#39;t win me over. Did I order wrong? Maybe. We ordered the wonton rellenos which were described as green chile &amp; cheese wrapped in wonton wrappers. No bait &amp; switch here. They were, in fact, wonton wrappers folded over green chiles and a bit of cheese. But they were so bland and flavorless I just couldn&#39;t figure out the purpose. I dobbed spoonfuls of sour cream on each bite to give it some flavor. I just don&#39;t get it because the idea is fantastic and these could really pop if there was some jalapeno or a different cheese inside. 
We also ordered a couple of salads. My friend ordered the cobb salad which looked just standard. I ordered the grilled steak Caesar salad which came with two quarters of romaine that had been lightly charred. A few parmesan crisps were a very nice touch. But. And. It came with a small handful of tiny bits of steak. I&#39;m not kidding. It was like small pieces of burnt ends of steak. Chewy, grissly. Just not appropriate for a 14 dollar salad. 
Like I said, I&#39;d go back to sit at the bar and have a couple of brewskies with Mike the bartender but for a nice dinner out, I think I&#39;ll probably make other selections for that."

They are comparable to outback steakhouse but priced like they are del Frisco. Service was awful on our visit. Ordered a pitcher of beer and server never delivered to our table. After 15 minutes of it sitting on the bar next to our server (who was in a debate with a manager over something) he walked into the kitchen and I just went up and grabbed it myself. Entrees were delivered by a food runner and we didnt have any silverware. Food was seasoned fairly well and decent quality,but overall not a great value for price especially with service gaps. We&#39;ve given this place a few tries since it is very close to our house, but always underwhelmed. We won&#39;t be back. It&#39;s a shame because I would love for a great steakhouse in the neighborhood."

What happened to this place? It used to be good.  I ordered a Cesar salad with shrimp and it looked like cat food.  I was hungry so I tried to eat it but just couldn&#39;t.  My son ordered a burger with jalapeño rings that he could&#39;ve cut his teeth on, they were so hard and rubbery.  He took them all out and kept trying to eat his burger but then the bacon was totally under done and way too chewy to be on a burger, so he took that out as well and tried another bite of his burger..then he just gave up. We told the overly fake and extremely slow waitress about it and she asked if we wanted something else.  Why would we want to order more bad food? Apparently she and the manager didn&#39;t like that because they only took $8 off our $45 bill.  The waitress was really smug about it too and I later regretted giving her the small tip that I did.  Also we noticed in the kitchen that a lot of the cooks had long beards and nothing to cover their hair. Gross."

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen it busy, but they do a lot of deals (e.g., Groupon, buy one get one, etc), so I always wind up here at least once a year.

The burgers are good (as are the sandwiches... though the bun is EXTREMELY buttery), the fries are tasty, and the service OK. I&#39;m racking my brain for something that really stands out about The Dusty Boot, but I can&#39;t think of anything. It&#39;s kind of quaint and saloon-y on the inside, but the rustic &#39;charm&#39; is lost when it&#39;s usually just you and a few other patrons at any given time. 

I guess the one thing that stands out in my mind is the price of drinks. $2.75 for a glass of Diet Coke? Wonder if it&#39;s laced with gold..."

We had a coupon for a BOGO dinner meal.  We figured we would order an appetizer as well.  We got the queso dip.  I suggest not ordering it.  It was NOT worth $9.  It was pretty much just warmed up old cheese.  It almost looked microwaved and was not a smooth creamy cheese, it was clumpy.  The chips were stale.  We were already off to a poor start.

I ordered a regular house margarita.  It came in a regular glass that was filled with mostly ice.  It was $8.  It was really bad.  It was probably the worst margarita I&#39;ve had in the Denver area out at a restaurant.... ever.   Yep that poor of quality.  

I did a build your own type burger.  It was fantastic.  It was the only thing that was good about the visit.  The fries that came with it were over seasoned.  I don&#39;t mind salty fries, but these were inedible.  

So, we get our bill.  Instead of taking the meal off for our BOGO, we got our queso taken off.  I asked for a manager.  It took him about 10 minutes to come.  I literally was getting up to leave when he finally arrived.  I explained the situation, told him I&#39;d already paid my bill, but left a poor tip.  I told him that our server was not poor, but whoever did our bill, my margarita, and my fries all did a shitty job.  I should have known that after reading the other Yelp replies on here that we&#39;d have a shitty experience as well.  I went into it hoping for the best.

The worst part was that I even had to talk to a manager.  I hate that.  I hate complaining, but I had to do it.  It was a terrible dining experience.  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING, period."

We went expecting steakhouse prices, but also expected steakhouse quality food and service. Nope. The food was a huge disappointment. We ordered prime rib tacos and a steak sandwich, both served with cold meat, as well as ingredients and portions that would be more appropriate at a Subway. Bland, cheap and served on huge plates that focused on the small entrees. I didn&#39;t realize the kids chicken was the cheap dinosaur fingers, but that was my fault. We totally understand when servers have a bad night... but the entire staff lacked training. Our girl forgot everything from silverware to parts of our order.

I was surprised when I walked in to find that it is actually pretty cheap looking inside and very casual. There seemed to be a lack of staff as the bartender appeared to also be playing hostess and waiter as well, not that this is a bad thing as he provided excellent service to myself and the couple of other patrons scattered throughout the restaurant and bar. Looking over the menu there was a large range of items to choose from and I resolved myself to return soon to try some other items. As it was I went with the prime rib. It was cooked to my liking and had good flavor, but nothing to be excited about. Dare I say, the quality was along the lines of Texas Roadhouse. Overall I was going to give the Dusty Boot 4 stars, until the bill came. It was shockingly more expensive than I had realized while ordering. Yes the menu items are all clearly priced and there were no shenanigans to speak of, I just should have paid closer attention to the running total while others in my party ordered. While the Dusty Boot is proud that they hand trim their steaks and cook everything to order, the quality was not up to the price point for the meal I had. I have seen mention of some deals like a BOGO night, which I would return for, but I do not believe I&#39;ll be back for a full price meal in the future."

There were 8 of us and with it being a Saturday night we did use Open Table to make our reservations.  They had the table ready for us were we arrived.
Service was not very good.  We had to ask several times for drinks or this or that and sometimes we got them, sometimes not.
Food was good.  We had several appetizers. The entire table had everything from a kids meal, prime rib, baked potato, to hamburgers.  There wasn&#39;t one complaint about the food.
And the dessert- funnel cake straws were FANTASTIC!!!

The service was TERRIBLE!  

We sat with empty glasses for long periods of time several times.  Our waitress would disappear for 15 minutes at a time.  It took 25 minutes from the time we ordered to the time the food came.  A burger came out medium rare when it was ordered medium well.  When it was sent back it was microwaved.  They even microwaved the lettuce.  When I complained about delays the waitress became surly.  Then when she refilled glasses she slammed the cups down on the table.  Talked with Travis, the manager, and he did reduce the cost by $5.00 for the inedible burger.  He apologized without offering any indication of a lesson learned or what they would do to correct the situation.  I&#39;ve been to this restaurant twice and both times the service was awful.

I sat at the bar and had the daily drink special of a $4 strong margarita, which was pretty good even though it was 75% ice.  The bartender was super nice and attentive, and I had my fish and chip entree in no time flat.  I imagine that was because the kitchen was set to shut down in 20 minutes and the cooks were looking to hit the road.  The food was Ok - the beer battered cod was over-fried but the fish itself was flaky and tasty.  

The interior has a dark feel to it, almost like an semi-intimate upper class restaurant.  There were only 15 or so people around the bar when I visited and there were only two open parking spots, so I imagine parking is a nightmare when it gets busy.  There are 5 TVs at the bar and probably more around the high-tops so it&#39;s a decent place to watch a game.

Dusty Boot is a step up from the inedible chain &#34;restaurants&#34; you find in abundance here in the &#39;burbs but the prices aren&#39;t that much more, everything was right around $10 for a normal entree.

No we close AT 9pm and so you must be old! Anyway we didn&#39;t expect that, but we were welcomed in and they tried...just didn&#39;t deliver. My husbands mashed potatoes were cold. Oh he&#39;s easily pleased. Um not to mention the ribeye was way to thin to sell at that price. It was like a half inch fatty, overly fatty cut. We love the marbling of a ribeye but this was like we were just throwing out money on that fat.  The burger seemed dry and realisitcally the only thing to brag about was the fries.

Despite the lengthy wait they charged us an extra 3 for another small loaf of bread. When I brought this to the waiters attention he was outright hostile and a complete jerk. Another time we went after waiting over 30 minutes for steaks the steak arrived nearly raw. It was supposed to be cooked Medium. We left the steak which was clearly raw and the waiter did not care one bit. They cater to regular bar patrons and ignore regulars who don&#39;t drink in my opinion.

We sat on the patio, which is the BEST patio in SE Aurora, and had our fair share of drinks! The jalapeno margarita and the cucumber margarita were THE BOMB! As well, on Wednesdays, they have BOGO burgers, this is a steal! 
Pretty good experience, however, if there is one bit of feedback I would give to them is speed up your drink services. We waited about minutes after we ordered a drink from the bar. That is pretty slow considering it really wasn&#39;t that busy at the restaurant.

For the first 4-6 months after coming here for the first time, rarely would a year go by when we didn&#39;t come here for BOGO burger Wednesday or just cause. Decent happy hour, BOGO burgers, good service, a great experience all the way around.

When the Groupon came out recently we realized we haven&#39;t been here for quite some time. Maybe 3 or 4 times in the last 6 months. And every time we go and decide not to come back, it&#39;s been service related. We almost always like the food, but when i sit there and have to wave down a server to get a refill, huge negative. My 11 year old was ordering off the adult menu and they gave him a kid size coke. WTF? 

Unfortunately, Dusty Boot is being taken out of the rotation, which is sad cause I truly enjoy their burgers."

Although I loved our server and hostess, the food didn&#39;t really seem unique to me. We got appetizers like their sliders, artichoke dip and the chile rellenos which came out cold. The place was extremely crowded and it was hard to hear the people speaking at my own table. Plus the sun blazing in made it hard to see. I asked one of the servers to close them but, I guess they forgot! And the Happy Hour menu was very confusing and different from what our server told us in person. I wasn&#39;t sure what to order.

We walk in and are blown away by the volume on the TV coming from the bar - Pats/Niners game.  We thought this was a steakhouse, not some sports bar!

Thought we may be able to escape the volume in the dining area - no way.  We are greeted by a large projection screen of the game with more volume getting pumped in.  It was obnoxious.  Looked around a other diners and no one was talking to each other because you couldn&#39;t even hear yourself think!!!

Lots of good options in SE Aurora - this isn&#39;t one of them.  They need to call it what it is - a tiny sports bar with standard bar fare.

I have some special dietary needs and the waitress was more than willing to listen closely to my special order as I instructed her how to modify what I was ordering.

It is a pretty nice combination of the best parts of a bar and a steakhouse. Our server was very good, as well. The portions are large and tasty - the food was delicious. 

Our prime rib and burger were a step or two undercooked from what we ordered, however. That seems to be a common issue at this restaurant. Hopefully the management reads these and can correct the kitchen&#39;s estimates of doneness. Because otherwise we had no complaints.

I would recommend trying this restaurant to my friends..."

We aren&#39;t looking for a fancy, schmancy date night joint, but we are looking for a place that allows our kiddo to join us and has decent food, a good atmosphere and good pricing.

I recommend people pay attention to their specials nights (see their website as they differ from location and they also change occasionally) as you get the best bang for your buck.  Buy one, get one on steaks, burgers and free kids meals make it a more affordable night out.

For food, we like their Happy Hour as they have 1 appetizer that makes an appearance that can&#39;t be found any other time:  Buffalo Chips - homemade potato chips topped with buffalo sauce, bacon, cheese and served with blue cheese or ranch.  We are also fans of the burgers and fries (my fav is the breakfast burger with cheese, bacon and a fried egg). 

We&#39;ve been to brunch twice on Sundays, and I&#39;ve had their carnitas pork hash which is to DIE for!  Hubby had a breakfast burrito which is massive, also with the carnitas inside, and green chile outside.  Kiddo loves the banana split waffle with a dulce sauce, fresh bananas and tons of whipped cream.

The wait staff and managers definitely aim to please.  They make mistakes from time to time, but do a great job trying to make it up to you and have you leave happy!  They have a BEAUTIFUL patio that overlooks the city (and new intersection construction).  For those who haven&#39;t been happy, it&#39;s probably because they were expecting a lot.  On the sign out from, it says Dusty Boot Steakhouse and Saloon.  For those familiar with the term Saloons, they are casual joints where you show up in your work boots.  (Dusty boots)  This isn&#39;t going to be an Elways and you aren&#39;t going to be picking peanuts out of the heals of your shoes like Texas Roadhouse.  This is a small, neighborhood steakhouse and bar that locals frequent and enjoy."

We previously had a bad experience at the Dusty Boot in Greenwood Village, and were given a gift card to try it again. So, we headed out to the one in Aurora. Here is what I thought...

FOOD: We started off with the Mac &#39;N Cheese wedges...they are awesome, but come on $8...really? I was shocked when I found out the price of this item. Next, I had a dinner salad--this was a joke. There were a couple pieces of lettuce on the plate, some tomatoes, onions and that&#39;s about it. Maybe it was the presentation of the salad that threw me off, it was on this GINORMOUS plate. My main course was the Smokey Burger. The BBQ sauce was great. Overall a good burger, but extremely messy - just to warn you.

SERVICE: We had an excellent waiter, he was friendly and efficient. However, the rest of the wait staff was just standing around, NOT helping him out. So, service was slow...but he was the ONLY waiter for the restaurant. That was the same problem at the other location. Obviously they have some staffing issues at this restaurant chain.

VENUE: It was kind of a weird setup, EXTREMELY loud and our table was dirty when we were seated. I was NOT impressed. The lighting killed my eyes because it would reflect off the menu and blind me. It was very strange.

Overall, the Mac &#39;N Cheese wedges are good, the burger was good...but not good enough to make me become a regular. We&#39;ve got about one more meal on our gift card and I will not be back. The one in Beaver Creek is much better, but the staffing issues in Denver will deter me from returning to these locations on my own."

The service was friendly prompt and very attentive. That was a pleasant plus. our waiter was not overbearing, but made sure we lacked nothing. 

The mimosas were priced right for the quality of the drink. $7 for a bottomless mimosa is a decent price. 

The burritos were generously portioned, but the meat was lacking in quantity, though the two or three peces of cubed steak I tasted were flavorful and pretty tender. I would have expected the guar and sour cream to be served with and not a la carte, for the price of the entree. The other thing we noticed was the burritos seemed to be finished in the microwave.

The menu was confusing. burritos, steaks, hummus, french fries, nachos.... It&#39;s a kitchen sink approach to food service that is unnecessary. Just be a great steakhouse, with complimentary sides, and don&#39;t go so overboard with every imaginable kid of food. 

We were there between the brunch and dinner service, and there were a fw people a the bar, and maybe two other tables. I would go back to see what service is like when they are more at capacity. I could tell this is a sort of neighborhood watering hole."

I would have given a full 5 stars but my burger was not cooked the way I asked it to be cooked.  I asked for it to be medium-well and it came to me medium.  A little too pink for me (although I was too hungry to send it back - besides, it was FREE).  My husband ordered his medium but it looked medium-rare to me (he didn&#39;t mind).  So just be mindful that they cook burgers on the rare side.  I will definitely go back on a Tuesday night, but next time I&#39;ll order it well done.

By the way, the french fries were awesome!  They were almost battered and fried...with ranch? Perfect!  The onion rings weren&#39;t bad either :)"

The ribs were darn good, well seasoned, meaty, and plentiful.  Right in line with 4 out of 5 stars.

Today, they had burgers on a BOGO special, so burgers it was.  My football buddy and I ordered the breakfast burger, which had eggs and bacon on it, along with regular burger toppings.  It was a 1/2 lb patty, juicy, well seasoned, on a ciabatta bun.  One of the best burgers I have had.  If you like Cricket burgers, you&#39;ll like these.  Fries were also a highpoint.

As for watching the game there, when we walked in, we were the ONLY people there (11am game) but soon afterward, the restaurant was full.  Not many watching the game, not like a regular sports bar, but a great place to watch the games.  Service was very attentive, we were well taken care of.  They have all the games on large enough screens (42&#34; or 50&#34;, not sure, didn&#39;t pay that much attention) and you are close by, so you will not miss any part of your game.

The also had drink specials for the games, we both had 2 drinks, and burgers/fries, and our bill came to just under $26, plus tip.  Great value, in my opinion."

Figured we would give this place a try.  My bf was smart and went on the safe side with some Pad Thai.  He said it was pretty good so no complaints there!  My problem was with the dishes I ordered.  Tom Kha Gai is one of my fave soups and I&#39;ve been feeling under the weather.  A little spicy warmth should do the trick, right?  Nope.  The soup arrived and it was much thicker than any Tom Kha I&#39;ve had before...that should have been a big red flag, but I was tired and tried it anyway.  I couldn&#39;t even eat half of it.  It was sweet, creamy, thick, and bland.  Typically Tom Kha has at least a LITTLE spice to it, lime juice, bay leaves...none of that stuff was in here!  I think they just used a bag of frozen vegetables, chicken, and boiled them in this white nondescript creamy soup.  I had also ordered the Panang curry (I love yellow curry!) thinking the soup might be a smaller portion.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t much better.  The same chicken and (what appeared to be) frozen vegetable medley was used in the entree with some cayenne/red pepper spice...but that was it!  I didn&#39;t get the typical curry taste...like it was bland and spicy at the same time, but lacked any other tastes.  So disappointed.  The one saving grace for me was the Vietnamese spring rolls.  So good!  The rice paper was light and crispy, and the flavors of the vegetables inside were nice.  I think maybe they do Vietnamese food better than Thai...so my recommendation would be to look for the Vietnamese menu items over any Thai options.

Update: I got terribly sick for two days after eating this food...may have been food poisoning/norovirus. Please beware. And if the owners read this, please send sick people home so they don&#39;t infect anyone else."

I was looking for a quick lunch, and with the holidays upon us, many places were closed.  I came across this place and stepped in to grab some grub.  The restaurant was empty, but the phone was ringing quite a bit for take out orders.  I decided to go with a basic beef and broccoli.  The steamed rice was fine, and there was quite a bit of it.  The eggroll was okay. The lunch portion of the b&amp;b was a touch skimpy.  The meat had that unpleasant gelatinous quality one sometimes encounters in Chinese food (perhaps a heavy hand with the cornstarch?).  It was not particularly flavorful.  The broccoli was overcooked and mushy.  It was not the worst Chinese I have ever had, but was definitely the most disappointing example of it I have had in recent months."

First of all, they seemed to have stolen the old Yang&#39;s menu (Tower &amp; Hampden).  We frequented Yangs and hoped this was actually the old owners opening a new place.  Not even friggin&#39; close.

The egg rolls had shredded cabbage.  Not even a carrot in there.  The menu says &#34;vegetables&#34; so maybe it was *two* cabbages, so the plural isn&#39;t a lie.  But it was terrible.  The vegetarian salad is just a shredded head of lettuce, a pinch of cabbage, and some chopped peanuts on top.  The Yangs one had crispy tofu on it (at the same price).  But this was a $6 half-head of iceberg lettuce.  Lame.   Finally, the Kung Pao used totally the wrong sauce.  We&#39;ve had this dish at probably 50+ restaurants, so we have a handle on the flavor.  They messed it up.

All in all, it was a huge disappointment, it&#39;s overpriced, and we&#39;ll never be back here.  For good Chinese food about five minutes away, go to Honeybee Asian Bistro"

I asked for something that was similar to chow mein, but they told me they didn&#39;t offer that, so they recommended the Hong Kong Noodles. I wanted beef and broccoli but they said it came with beef. I said okay and ordered it. I didn&#39;t check the food before I left which was a mistake on my part, but when I got home to finally eat... it was a huge disappointment. 

I am allergic to mushrooms and they didn&#39;t inform me there was mushrooms in it. They didn&#39;t even tell me there was vegetables. I received a brick of noodles. Hard crispy noodles. Of course, NOTHING like chow mein. 

I called to get my food exchanged for something iv&#39;e tried before and enjoyed last time i ate there. On their website it says FREE DELIVERIES, min. or 15$. So I asked if someone could just bring me food I enjoyed last time and take back what I received 10 minutes ago. 

The rude lady that took my order said no. Kept putting me on hold and upset she had to deal with an angry customer. She kept saying &#34;I think we can do that&#34;.. &#34;Maybe...&#34; so I said whatever I&#39;ll just drive ALL THE WAY BACK to get my refund. I got there and she shook her head at another employee. Had fake nails and couldn&#39;t even grab my card off the glass counter. I had to do it for her. Besides the fact, RUDE woman, she gave very very terrible customer service.

We got one of their flyers in the mail and decided to give it a try. I have to admit, it was pretty good. 

It&#39;s really an Asian Fusion type place. A lot of Chinese influences mixed with Thai.

On with the review.

Since they&#39;re too far to deliver to us, I decided to make it a carry out order. The guy on the phone was a little hard to understand, but he made sure to repeat my order, which was reassuring. I ordered the Volcano Beef with fried rice for myself, Thai Basil Chicken with fried rice for the wife, Golden Tofu, wonton soup and an extra order of crispy eggrolls and brown rice.


The food was excellent. And I didn&#39;t notice it until we were digging in, but they gave us a free bag of cream cheese wontons.

Good food, friendly people. I will be going back."

Granted I only ordered spring rolls (were ok, but not great) and pad thai, so can&#39;t comment on the rest of the menu. Pad Thai is a pretty easy dish, though, and it was oily, syrup-sweet, and poor quality. It was a huge portion, but just not good. I have had similar Thai dishes at places that are not Thai, so hoping their other dishes (not Thai) are good, but won&#39;t be finding out myself."

I&#39;ve ordered a few dishes from here (Chow Fun, Sesame Chicken, etc), and they were good.

However, this restaurant has the best Thai Hot and Sour soup (Tom Yum Goong (TYG)) that I have had in a long while.  Their soup surpasses in terms of flavor and substance the same TYG from:
Thai Garden
Thai Lotus
Wild Ginger
Thai Pepper II
Pearl of Siam

For $6.50:  6-8 shrimp, onions, pea pods, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, baby corn, peppers, and carrorts, but no button mushrooms. :(  Plenty of flavor even with rice added.

The Thai Spring Rolls were pretty good as well (better than Pho 95 next door), but not up to the size of Thai Garden."

I order in all of the time and so far they have had the best consistent food. They have fast delivery and the orange chicken rocks. The prices are fair and the portions are huge.  Keep it up thanks.

First off their dishes are Chinese and Vietnamese inspired not so much Thai. Second the food is okay at best. I was underwhelmed to say the least. The really sad thing is I don&#39;t even remember what I ordered because it was that unmemorable.  I am sure there are far better places to get take out, delivery and any variation of asian cuisine Thai Express claims to make. I just am not seeing what the whole hoopla is about this place...sorry."

I arrived 20 minutes later and there was a queue of people waiting in front of the cash register.  None of the workers looked at me for 5 minutes and then finally someone asked what I ordered, but then I never heard any status.  After waiting at the restaurant for 15 minutes, I gave up and went to Panda Express (which took another 15 minutes :(.  I&#39;ve never seen so much frenzy with nothing actually getting done as at Moon Thai.  The food may or may not be good, I guess I&#39;ll never know."
