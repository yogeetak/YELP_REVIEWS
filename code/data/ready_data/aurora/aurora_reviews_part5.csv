Up the street from my place and it had a good amount of high stared reviews. Yelp vouched for it so I&#39;m going to eat. Worth it for sure. Not sure how I slept on this place for so long. 

Free chips and salsa. Point. Salsa had good flavor and heat. I had a Sol beer and my partner water and a Dos Equis. Reasonably priced. Had a Bloody Mary later which tasted great but couldn&#39;t tell if it had alcohol. For 6.75 I would hope so. Good house made mix it seemed like. Spice and flavor wise. And it tasted like real tomatoes juice and not just mix. Wow! 

I had a bean tostada a la carte for 1.75 and the big burrito. No steak but extra peppers and veggies and it was loaded. My partner had cheese enchiladas and we both had food leftover for tomorrow. Very large portions and we were amazed by the rice and beans accompanying the plates. Hey actually tasted like beans and rice rather than brown mush and orange &#34;rice.&#34; 

Would certainly return and try more. We already decided this is our go to for real Mexican. And we want to bring any visiting friends or family next visit. 10/10"

Flashy digs or innovative fusions still come second to quality food, and a good deal never hurts. Guadalajara might be a ways out of downtown on the highway to Boulder, but the drive is worth the effort for a place that ticks off the boxes. 

How do I know it&#39;s good? Look at all the locals in there, sitting outside on the benches patiently waiting for a table to open. Smell the savory fragrances from sizzling skillets floating out the door. They seated my party of five and a half (with toddler) in good time despite it being dinner time, and the service came quickly to refill drinks, deliver baskets of tortilla chips, and update us on our orders. The latter, though welcome, wasn&#39;t necessary given they came back with burritos, tacos, and other delights in quick time.

Portions here are generous, bordering on big enough to split between two. Come hungry or eager to return home with a box of leftovers. Most entrees come with rice and beans atop the piles of meat-filled corn and flour tortillas. 

By the way, there&#39;s no question: go for the corn tortillas. Ours were fresh and flavourful all around, and they made a wonderful counterpoint to  the pico-sprinkled shrimp tacos. My tummy is grumbling just thinking about it, a cruel hardship given lunch won&#39;t serve me up anywhere nearly as satisfying or well prepared.

Other thoughtful touches elevate Guadalajara into great, low-key Mexican trestaurant territory. They bring out generous slices of lime to squeeze over the tacos, long slivers of fresh avocado atop rice, and extra tortillas as though anticipating their abundant fillings will no doubt be shared. They&#39;re right. We were trading and sharing bits of our dishes, and still had more than we could possibly eat. 

Prices are reasonable, $7-12 for the average entrees, and they have a full range of Southwestern favourites. The aforementioned shrimp tacos are magical, and the burritos got high marks from everyone at my table. 

PROTIP: Parking around here is tight. Avoid the front three spaces beside the restaurant because customers getting takeout box those cars in."

The chips and salsa are hands down the best part of the experience. The chips are thin and crispy with the perfect hit of salt. Salsa was nice and smooth, not chunky which I&#39;m not a fan of. 

My friend and I both ordered carnitas. The plate was an enormous amount of food. It was so big that I took half home to the hubs for his lunch the next day. The carnitas was good but I&#39;ve had more flavorful versions. The guac didn&#39;t taste totally fresh. When I put the green chili with the carnitas and salsa into a tortilla it was a tasty blend of flavors!"

There is always a wait not matter when you go but it&#39;s worth it. The chips and salsa are free, endless and amazing. We have been several times since finding it two months ago and everything has been phenomenal. The portions are YUGE. They frequently come out on what I think is supposed to be a platter. We&#39;ve had the carnitas, carne asada, cheese enchiladas, chili relleno (soft and crispy) and steak quesadillas. Everything is fantastic but my personal favorite is the quesadilla. The place is always clean and well cared for and the service is exceptional. One of my favorite spots in Denver for sure."

I wasn&#39;t rushed. They&#39;re open fairly late, which I appreciate. They have possibly the smallest bathroom known to man, but it was clean, and not difficult to use or get in or out of.

We stopped by with a somewhat large party (8 people) before heading over to Colorado Escape. We picked this place because it was one of the highest rated restuarents in the area, and I would have to say that the experience supported that fact.

There was a somewhat long wait for a table, but that ended up being okay because we had friends in this party who never seem to show up on time anywhere. The hostess was so nice while we waited. The restaurant was CROWDED - always a good sign!

Everyone ordered a bar drink, mostly margaritas, and everyone thought they were good. I decided to think outside the box and got a michelada instead, and I loved it! 

The food was exquisite. It came on HUGE plates, each one so full that food ran right up against the edges. I had a 3-taco combo plate, and they even let me pick my tacos a la carte style, even though the menu said 3 of the same kind of taco. This way I got to try the shrimp, chicken, and carne asada all at once!

The dining room&#39;s overcrowding was a bummer. People bumped into me all the time walking past our table, but that was only a minor annoyance. I have to deduct stars because the restaurant allows soliciting. There was a sketchy-looking dude bringing a small display of what appeared to be pirated DVDs around to the tables, selling them for cash. He didn&#39;t come visit us (maybe because we were white?), but I still didn&#39;t like to see him hassling the other patrons.

I would definitely come back because the food was so on point. However they really need to do something about expanding the dining room so it can seat everyone comfortably - not to mention that there isn&#39;t enough parking."

Small and very crowded place but we were still able to get a table easily. The menu was very diverse and offered a wide variety of your usual Mexican fare (tacos, rellanos, enchiladas, burritos) but it also has some unique specials that we were not familiar with but that appeared to be popular with the locals. Our first time we played it safe and went with our favorite gotos at Mexican Food places and I got the carne adovada and the wife got the carnitas. Both were amazing! They were right up there with our current favorite place, D&#39;Corazon in Lodo! And since D&#39;Corazon is closed for a month out of the year we now have a good alternative!

The staff was also awesome. Friendly, attentive, and helpful, they were the icing on an already delicious cake. 

Look forward to coming back!"

Yelp was right, this place is awesome!  Hubby devoured his carnitas and got a takeout order of something delicious he saw a guy at another table enjoying (not sure what it&#39;s called, but it&#39;s served in a big bowl and has shrimp in it.)  Later that evening he devoured his takeout all by himself - it was so good he forgot to save some for me (pout!)

What impressed me most about Guadalajara was the service.  Absolutely the best waitresses ever!  Even though it was packed, they served our meal promptly, refilled beverages spontaneously, and brought me a to-go container without being reminded.  I waitressed in college, and am consistently disappointed with waitstaff performance here in Colorado.  I can honestly say that Guadalajara scored an A+ for great service, and my hubby can&#39;t wait to go back and have everything on the menu."

Guadalajara Mexican Restaurant is a gem! This place blows all other Mexican places in Colorado. Be prepared to wait on a friday-saturday night, but it is worth it. Don&#39;t eat a whole day or even two before your trip. Because you will pig out and it will be worth it as well. My fiancé ordered Tampiqueno and I went for an octopus ceviche (not on the menu, but they gladly accommodated my request and did not overcharge us for the special order). We completely devoured both dishes. And all the corn chips. And all the margaritas.

It&#39;s very crowded and we had to wait in our car for about ten minutes which is a good sign for me. When we finally got in the waitress had a huge smile and it looked like a family restaurant, it was small but homey. I ordered a chicken fajitas which was about 13 dollars and I thought it was a little expensive but every bite was so fresh. When they brought the food and it was still sizzling on the plate. On top of all of that they still gave me a ton of small tortillas to keep stuffing my face. The fajitas were perfectly seasoned with salt/oregano and the chicken had an amazing burst of juice. I honestly can&#39;t wait to go back and try other things on the menu."

Roughly an extra 15 minute drive, but well worth it considering their exceptional food. The restaurant itself is fairly small, but quaint. The atmosphere was busy and upbeat. I am very happy we got seated right away because as we walked in, all I saw were people! A good thing though since a lot people means good food in my books! The staff was very attentive and friendly as well. Great service!

My girlfriend and I started our meal with the carne asada nachos. The appetizer alone could have been a meal on its own! Very generous serving of food! A lot of carne asada! Which I loved! topped with cheese, refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, onions tomatoes, etc. For our entrees, I ordered the Plato Arriero and the Carne Asada tacos. I didn&#39;t realize how big the plates were until we got them, so needless to say, there was a lot of food at our table for two! My Plato Arriero consisted of Chicken, steak carne adobada, beans and rice. The taco plate came with 3 tacos, corn or flour tortilla choice also with beans and rice. The meat was all seasoned perfectly and distinctly. I love when I order combination meat plates from restaurants and they do this correctly, not just seasoning the meats all with one type. The tacos had the carne asada meat, but chopped up to put in the tortillas and this was also very good! My girlfriend ordered the carne asada plate and everything on there was also cooked and season well.

What makes this place differ from the others, would have to be the quality of food and the great seasonings they cook with their meat. It seems that there is a standard at the other places I&#39;ve eaten and they seem to be met by my previous favorite place. Guadalajara just ups the ante and makes me like them even more! Highly recommended if you are in the area and want some great Mexican food!"

Hole in the wall, authentic Mexican food right in the hood!! This place is bomb!! I got the Guadalajara cam stones- bacon wrapped shrimp with beans n rice! Simply delicious. Other places are just so damn salty when you order bacon wrapped shrimp- this place was not. It was cooked to perfection. I got a side of chicken enchiladas and a bean tostada. I&#39;m so picky about beans- taste, color, texture. These beans were tasty and the tostada she&#39;ll it was on was thick n crunch. My hubby got the burrito, enchilada and chile relleno plate.

Not to mention, my dish was cheap!! My other guests ordered different burritos and tacos and nearly licked their plates clean! Yes, I am not exaggerating when I say the food is that good.  Also, I always find mexican restaurants have very chunky, overwhelming sour cream, but this place offers actual mexican sour cream- thinner and better consistency. I can not tell you how wonderful my enchiladas were- melty cheese, layers of shredded chicken, and salty sauce to add to the flavor. Definitely give this place a try!- you will not regret it!"

Never the less, I was wowed by the delicious food here, the shredded pork just melts in your mouth with flavor, and the green chile has just the right amount of heat to it.  The wait staff here are all very friendly and on top of things, and the Patron Margaritas on the rocks are delicious!!! We had a large party (10 people) and no problems being seated even though it is a tiny restaurant, will definitely be back !"

Every dish is overflowing with flavor. Each individual piece, the steak, the chili, the rice, the shell, every ingredient packs a punch. It&#39;s noticeably tasted in each bite. Not a bland bite to be found. The salsa (one of them at least) is my favorite is town."

The service was good and the drinks came quickly. Chips and salsa included, salsa was flavorful and not really hot. We all got enchilada plates and they we&#39;re just right. Light, meaty and good quality. A good tasting traditional plate. I would only change the rice to not have peas and carrots mixed in. Also liked that all the drinks came in full size glasses, big &#39;Rita glasses too. Yum!!

FYI neighborhood is a bit sketch but if the locals love it, you know its good."

I&#39;m kicking myself for not finding it sooner. Everything was delicious. We&#39;ve had the Guadalajara platter. The shrimp alone would have left me happy. The addition of beef and chicken was even better. Everything was seasoned well and the portions are big. The chorizo queso is warm, melty and taco greasy. As it should be. The place is small, but the friendliness of the staff make it feel cozy, not cramped. The bar and restaurant are in separate buildings. This allows the restaurant to be kid friendly. You can get the same great food in the bar,without worrying about little ears and eyes censoring your good time. My only criticism would be the rice. It was mushy, not fluffy and it was bland. However I&#39;m not there for the rice, so that gets a pass from me."

The tweens with me had kids meals and were quite satisfied with the portion size. I had the shrimp tacos. There was plenty of shrimp - no skimping here!  My husband had a different shrimp meal and said it was very good also. The retried beans were great - still had some beans in them and weren&#39;t at all pasty like the canned varieties. A great YELP find!

We&#39;ve been pretty disappointed so far. We found this place based off of the yelp reviews and it&#39;s been pretty darn good. The salsa is a deal breaker and the red salsa here is great. Spicy but not torture hot. The fajitas are also great! Ceviche is huge! The two of us couldn&#39;t finish half. Claudio was our server and so nice! He did a great job. Very small and casual place."

I think the star attraction is their seafood, or their molcajete.. that is ALL I would recommend since it looked normal.
We waited for an hour after the hostess said the wait would only be 20 minutes.
The chips were very stale, gross.  The salsa had a good heat to it but was watery.
When they brought out our entrees they were topped w processed cheese. It seemed the enchilada sauce was made from tomato soup/spaghettios base. The chili relleno was a small cream cheese/pepper chimichanga. I did not finish my meal or enjoy it. What was weirder was that my plate was as big as a large (18 inch) pizza pan. It was the weirdest looking thing to be served a small chopped up enchilada and a tiny chimichanga on a huge platter.  I slid my food to the edge of the plate closer to me. It was awkward. 
The guacamole was flavorless, no lime, salt, onion powder or garlic. 
Would not recommend."

This was my first time here but I&#39;ve heard good things. I didn&#39;t expect it to be so small and me and my friend had to wait a little over half an hour for a table, but it was so worth it. The free chips and salsa were a little spicy but yummy, we couldn&#39;t decide what we wanted to eat everything looked so good. We both ordered the tampiquena plate #37 and it was such a huge meal for $13!! And service is excellent, they have strong team work here so you kinda see everyone stopping off at your table.

I grew up in L.A with really authentic Mexican restaurants and still haven&#39;t been a fan. My husband on the other hand loves it. We moved to CO and the first thing he looked for is a good Mexican restaurant. Its been months and he was starting to think that he wouldn&#39;t find one... And then we came here.

This tasted authentic to me and it was actually very good. I would definitely come back. It&#39;s always a good sign when the horchata tastes good and their horchata tasted amazing. 

The food came out fairly fast and it looked great but tasted even better. The price to me was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get. I was very impressed with the service as well. I foresee a lot more burrito eating in my future :)"

Our second visit was right at lunchtime on a Sunday.  Packed with families enjoying themselves in the small setting.  Our waiter Claudio was friendly , professional and a pleasure to share our mealtime with.  Our food came in a fair amount of time with minor modifications which caused no issues to them.  I had the best warm chicken taco salad made simply and delicious without the overload of beans at other places designed to keep prices down. A side of green chili for the dressing and plenty of guacamole and sour cream in a crispy shell. $6.95 !!!  Hubby had a combo plate loaded for same price and was pleased with each item .

The place is in a sketchy area and the outside of the restaurant is nothing to brag about but when you walk in, it&#39;s decorated really nice with some great finishes.    There was a line out the door of people waiting to get seated so that was a good sign.  I ordered a smothered burrito and it was good but it didn&#39;t blow me away.  Growing up with homemade mexican food however has me very picky about my beans and chili.

First time I tried this soup that I couldn&#39;t spell. It has cactus leaves, beef, shrimp, etc. Very interesting flavor, although a tad too sour for me. It was a good adventure as I finished it all.
Second time I order this grill platter. There was so much meat in it, that three adults in my party couldn&#39;t finish it. Quail is the most tasteful. 
Since they don&#39;t take reservation, timing could be a little tricky. First time I had to wait 30 minutes to get a seat, second time the restaurant was half empty, even though we went about the same time of the evening / day of the week."

Her response to me was that they never know hot hot their peppers are going to be so no they don&#39;t have any less hot. Seriously?

I went on Cinco de Mayo and was excited that there was no wait, the restaurant was nearly empty.  We were seated quickly and our drink order was taken by the hostess.  It then took quite some time for our assigned server to come by.  He was apathetic and bland, never refilled our chips and salsa, forgot part of our order (it never did arrive), and spent more time refilling his own drink than doing anything else. The interior is very small and there is not much going on as far as decor or ambiance. They didn&#39;t even have music playing as far as I can remember.

The food was served hot and well seasoned. The beans were delicious but the rice was bland and dry.  My margarita was okay, but nothing special. Overall really, pretty &#34;meh&#34;. I will try other places before I consider returning here."

Some of my preferred dishes here are the French onion soup, fried cheese appetizer , and green chile burger.

We arrived when the restaurant opened and were the only ones there. After placing our order, we waited nearly half an hour for the food to come out. I&#39;m sorry but it should not take that long to make a grilled cheese sandwich, soup and a chicken bowl. 

On to the food, the sandwich and soup were edible but not great. The chicken in my chicken bowl was so dry and tough that I only able to choke down one bite.  All the other ingredients in there were just randomly put together and had no flavor. Even the bowls at chipotle are 10x better. I mentioned to the server that the chicken was tough and she apologized but didn&#39;t bother to take it off the check. I left feeling hungry and cheated. Will not be going back there again."

They are very attentive, staff are welcoming and the ambiance is really nice. Shelly at the bar is just fantastic compared to a lot of bartenders we meet.

We have been in a few times now as I live fairly local and usually sit in the bar area. Lots of locals come by and gives it a very friendly atmosphere for you to sit and relax.
The happy hour food menu and drinks are a great deal too!

We usually time our visits for when live music/band is playing which they have a couple of times a week and the place can get packed out.

All in all a really good restaurant/bar and they are constantly improving."

We were literally the only two people in the restaurant. This was a bad sign, because the restaurant next door was PACKED. But we were in the mood for something other than pizza... 

So the meals started off bad. We ordered the Brussel sprouts appetizer. For $6 bucks it was the smallest ramekin of Brussel sprouts ever! More like a small side. It was lightly roasted with no char and doused in vinegar and mixed with unevenly cut Granny Smith apple matchsticks. But before I could even taste the dish, I unraveled the napkin to reveal the most disgusting pair of utensils . There was still a chunk of whatever on my fork and the knife looked dirty as well. 

The rest of the meal was uneventful... Well there was the Mac and cheese, which was more like cream and shells. 

Like someone mentioned before, the owners have little to no restaurant experience. There was an older couple at the restaurant whom I assumed were the owners. They were extremely aloof and didn&#39;t even bother to look at us when we mentioned the utensils were dirty. 

Overall, the food was subpar and definitely not worth the price we paid. Maybe on a live music night, it&#39;s worth it , but save your money for the pizza place next door otherwise."

I didn&#39;t choose the location of our meet up, so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I think I was expecting it to be more swanky because I was thinking of something like a Vegas hot spot. This place reminded me of something that belongs in a strip mall, which is basically where it&#39;s located in DTC. There are condos/apartments above the restaurant and other shops/restaurants down the way.

The happy hour seems pretty good with some great prices on drinks and food. I happened to order from the regular menu, but got the happy hour red wine to accompany my food. The wine was decent, but took a long time to get to me. The reuben was average, and quite salty. I suppose that&#39;s normal for a reuben, and I like salty food, but this seemed a little over the top.

In the end, I felt like the left hand didn&#39;t know what the right hand was doing while I was there. The waiters seemed to be overwhelmed with the number of people in the restaurant and regularly had to check on prices and menu options with the management. 

I&#39;d probably go back here, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice. It&#39;s a bit out of the way, and I wasn&#39;t that impressed with the food."

I&#39;ve lived in the area for about a year and a half and I&#39;m really happy to see that there is a new place that offers a wide variety of food and a great happy hour! I have tried most of the food items and have enjoyed it all. I only have one gripe, and that&#39;s the desert... I ordered it to go once and could only have one bite. I see the servers bring out the desert tray often and it seems to change up quite a bit, I may give it another try but probably will just stick to drinks :) I love the green chili - and I found out that it is gluten free, for all you gluten free freaks. $4 drinks and small bites for happy hour. They have a special for taco Tuesday also, a margarita (or a beer) and 2 tacos for $9.95. The tacos are good! I have only ordered the beef, but it&#39;s tender and juicy and has a nice flavor, especially with the Siracha. 

Other things I love and why:
Lobster sliders - need I explain? 
Shisito Peppers - these are new to the menu and definitely have a great flavor.
Pesto Turkey Sandwich - My favorite for lunch. 

Anyway, I haven&#39;t been dissatisfied with any of the food I have tried here. The servers are fun and friendly. The atmosphere is lively and there&#39;s t.vs to watch sports! :)"

Darien and his staff went out of their way to make the party memorable for my wife and the 70+ friends that were in attendance.  Our friends still talk about how great the venue, food and service were.

I was enticed in by a coupon for a free burger, otherwise it may have been awhile before I knew this place was here even though it&#39;s pretty close to home. 

Since the burger was free, I decided to try one of those, as did my husband. They were good burgers, and I enjoyed the crispy onions on mine, but it wasn&#39;t the best burger I&#39;ve ever had. In fact, some of the local fast-casual burger joints nearby are pretty competitive on the burger front. My husband&#39;s chili burger came covered in chili (fork eating only), and unfortunately it was on the cold side- my husband isn&#39;t a complainer and said he was too hungry to wait for them to fix it. The sweet potato fries were nothing special, pretty sure there&#39;s a brand I can buy in the freezer section at the grocery store I like just as well.

The rest of the lunch menu is mostly salads and sandwiches. I would be interested in giving them a try again, and hopefully find something that knocks my socks off. Service was pretty good, no complaints there. And I like the modern decor- it&#39;s very bright and open in there. I&#39;ll be back."

The interior looks like a wine bar in terms of the upscale decor, but with flat screen televisions everywhere. Make up your mind - are you a wine bar/romantic type place or a place where people go to watch the big game? You can&#39;t be both. While we sat at the bar (my boyfriend was eating - I wasn&#39;t hungry enough to pay $15 for an entree and thus was just having a drink) a commercial for some kind of foot scraping pedicure device came on the television - really gross and unappealing while eating, you know? 

The menu has no small plates - want to come in here for a beer and a snack? Well, that&#39;s not going to happen unless you want soup, a side salad, or chili - those are pretty much the only plates under $10. I know this is a relatively well-to-do area (I live in the complex) but what if you don&#39;t want a full entree? As a woman who doesn&#39;t eat massive portions I felt like the menu didn&#39;t have many options for me. Additionally, the menu was very haphazard - burgers, random entrees that didn&#39;t really seem to make sense together - it&#39;s almost like someone scribbled down a bunch of the popular entrees while watching a Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives show and made a menu out of them, and brought the prices up to around $15 minimum ($25 for the &#39;fancy&#39; entrees).

My boyfriend ordered a buffalo sausage which came with onions and peppers on a pretzel roll (not homemade/fresh) and a side of Sysco frozen fries - for about $13 (there&#39;s no menu online so I cannot confirm its exact cost). While the food was fine, it was not a $13 meal - it looked like something that came from Buffalo Wild Wings. He said it tasted fine, nothing to write home about. Except later that night after it being the only thing he&#39;d eaten that afternoon/evening he came down with a serious case of, uh, intestinal distress. 

The bartender who served us was nice - but part way through eating a lonely manager (the place was deserted on a Friday night) wandered over and asked if our meal was okay - the weird thing about it was that he looked like he was going to cry - he had the saddest most somber expression - it made us super uncomfortable. We likely won&#39;t be back, but since this seems to be a fledgling business - here&#39;s my tips to try and actually keep this place open:

-Decide if you&#39;re going to be a romantic, sit-down spot or a place where you go and have drinks and watch a game or enjoy some conversation with your friends. The restaurant lacks an identity and it makes it weird. Are you an upscale burger bar or a place that serves $25 entree plates? The menu is not cohesive and it doesn&#39;t look like it was written by a chef. Pick a core food type or style to focus on.

- Add some smaller plates to your menu or some appetizers that aren&#39;t $10. I&#39;m not willing to shell out tons of money for stuff that came out of a frozen bag from Sysco. I was told a side of fries was $8 - you&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Add some fresh, seasonal small plates to your menu and you&#39;ll see revenue from people adding them to their orders. Also, the menu literally reads like an expensive sports bar menu with the back page of date night type high price dinners - pick one. Eddie Merlot&#39;s is about to open in the same parking lot, so I would say err on the side of nice sports/burger bar and go in that direction - since they&#39;re definitely going to be the &#39;date spot&#39; joint and a nice sports bar would do well here since the only other option is Marco&#39;s.

Unfortunately, given the menu, the strange ambiance, and the food quality - we won&#39;t be returning, and if this place manages to stay in business for longer than a year I&#39;ll eat my hat. Bonne chance!

Edited to Add (1/20/16): Someone on Yelp with one review (not for this location) and no other information on their Yelp page contacted me today to tell me to eat my hat as this place is still in business. I&#39;m assuming this person was with the restaurant (who else would spend the time to send such a message?) which is pretty petty and sad on their part. There&#39;s no accounting for taste - and I guess if you&#39;re a suburbanite with an unrefined palate, a penchant for frozen pre-made Sysco food, and plenty of disposable income, then this place fits the bill."

We had the pesto turkey sandwich with house chili, and the green chili grilled cheese with fries. The food was good, and the ingredients were very fresh (which is what bumped the review up to four stars). 

The service was ok. It was a little slow, and the waitress didn&#39;t know much about the menu when we asked about items. She was great on refilling drinks without asking. 

Will definitely come back and try brunch - the menu looks amazing!"

However, I was with a large party for work.  The place is pretty nice in general and in a great area however overall I feel the ratings are about right.  The menu is where I had most of the issues.  Simply put it is all over the place and lacks focus.  You go to certain places to have certain things, this place has a little of everything and nothing that you said I MUST have that.  

The food was good, but on the pricey side considering what you you were getting.  The staff was friendly and they had good beers.  It seemed like they are trying a bit to hard by adding that one extra thing to make the dish or drink a bit off.  Sure, lets add jalapeño and orange to tequlia.

All and all, the place was nice and if someone said lets go back, I would be ok with it.  Good happy hour."

The last few experiences have been so bad I&#39;m done with it and sharing so others don&#39;t waste their money at this place. 

The pot stickers come from a freezer and apparently they do not get orders often as they were horribly freezer burned, flavorless and not even dog food grad. 

The biscuits and gravy is just greasy and flavorless. Just plain repulsive. Do not order. 

The manager has no clue what he is doing. It is clear that he has never run a restaurant. Not only is he weird and creepy, he doesn&#39;t even know enough about his own restaurant to help out his limping staff."

It certainly wasn&#39;t bad, but we both walked out saying, &#34;meh.&#34; The cocktails were good, and happy hour is a good deal. But I honestly couldn&#39;t taste or sense the vodka in mine. We had pork sliders and candied Brussels sprouts for a starter, and the pork sliders were good, but the Brussels sprouts were not in the least bit candied or seasoned. They were still tasty, being roasted, but weren&#39;t as advertised. 

For entrees, we both ordered burgers, but the menu was a little misleading. Under burgers, the &#34;Gorgonzola burger&#34; listed &#34;blue cheese&#34; as one of the ingredients - is it Gorgonzola or bleu cheese? That was my husband&#39;s burger, and it was good. I ordered the portobello burger, thinking it was a beef burger with mushrooms (the menu describes all burgers as having beef patties, and placed it amongst the other burgers with no vegetarian indication), but was disappointed to find it was a vegetarian burger. It was just mediocre, but the fries were good. The food seems to have changed since photos were posted. We chose not to have dessert. 

Our service was fine - our server was new, but nice. The atmosphere was also fine in terms of the decor and the TVs, but there was a loud family with kids running around next to us (clearly no fault of the restaurant&#39;s). To sum up, we probably won&#39;t go back, but it wasn&#39;t bad."

I tried the Drop it Like it&#39;s Hot cocktail and was pleasantly surprised, especially since I&#39;m not a fan of jalapeno. I was particularly please with how generous they are with the toppings - tons of strawberries in my drink, burger was loaded with mushrooms, etc. Although I&#39;m a little unsure of the music....was a strange selection for the atmosphere.

Our sever seemed overwhelmed. We waited for our food for about an hour. I asked our server if the food was ready to come out soon. She said yep two minuets. Everyone around us even tables who were seated after us had their food. After ten minutes I flagged down the manger and he was very helpful. He offered us free entree cards for each of us and took $50.00 off the tab. I asked for French fries to hold us over until our food came. He brought them over immediately. The manger really did his best and was very nice. Thank you. 

We ended up getting our food shortly after we asked the manager. My black bean burger was cold and it was served it a metal bowl..... Which was unappetizing. At this point we were just happy to have food. The tatter tots were very good. Everyone else&#39;s food was hot and they enjoyed their meal.

The burger itself is not the overly-smoky fake tasting stuff you often find (I appreciate this since I am a vegetarian mostly because I dislike meat, and not a vegetarian looking to replace the taste of meat). The custom/make-your-own burger is definitely the way to go (it&#39;s the type where you get a mini pencil to check off as many of the toppings you&#39;d like on a pad of paper). I&#39;ve been here a few times and tried many combinations of toppings, but I highly suggest the tomato jam, the fried mozzarella, and the pineapple. Burgers come with a choice of fries, sweet potato fries, etc. which are all delicious. The house margarita is super strong but delicious, there&#39;s a limit of 2, and I can certainly see why. Definitely a fun place in one of my favorite areas in the neighborhood."

Our waiters name was Austin and he did a great job at presenting the menu to us and making sure our drinks were full.

It was late night happy hour so we started with some fried pickles, fries, and wings. I didn&#39;t like how they thin-shaved pickles for their fried pickles; the slices are so thin that they just absorb oil and not have much of any pickle to them. My family enjoyed the wings, but kept finding attached feathers, which was weird and unappetizing for us vegetarians. The fries were good and the bad daddys sauce that comes with them is AMAZING - put it on everything. 

I created my own veggie burger per another Yelpers exact recommendations : with tomato jam and fried mozzarella, adding jalapeños. It was really good, but the mozzarella was tasteless and for the added expense and calories, I would deduct it from my burger next time. I got tots for my side and they were crisp and delicious.

My brother enjoyed his burger that he ordered off the menu. It had pesto and egg on it.

My boyfriend also enjoyed his plain cheeseburger with mustard.

My mom ordered a create your own salad small size and an order of sweet potato fries, both of which were delicious!

Although the restaurant seemed very understaffed and there was longer of a wait to be greeted and receive drinks and get an order taken than there should have been, I appreciate a server that remains calm under pressure and works hard, and Austin did that.

Besides bbq, Bad Daddy&#39;s is the main thing I missed when I moved from Charlotte. Their burgers are spectacular and if thats not your thing, they have tons of other options. Luckily this location is close to work, located in Landmark in the old Ali Baba&#39;s location and it&#39;s on fire! I stopped here with a colleague for lunch the other day and we were in and out in less than an hour. My go to when I go to Bad Daddy&#39;s is the Sam I Am, burger with pesto, cheese and a fried egg but I didn&#39;t want to have that all over my face so I went with something more refined, the French. Now that I&#39;ve had that, the Sam I Am has serious competition. The Frenchie is a turkey burger with granny smith apples, brie, bacon and garlic mayo. It&#39;s what dreams are made of and I wish I could live in a world where I could eat that everyday but also still fit into my pants. Sigh, such is life. 

Fun fact--the Mama Ricotta Burger and Cantina Burger are named after restaurants in Charlotte. Anytime I see that it gives me a sense of nostalgia. Bad Daddy&#39;s also has a killer happy hour during the regular happy hour time and later on at night, check it out!

I&#39;m stoked to see Bad Daddy&#39;s popping up in the Denver Metro area--long live their burgers!"

Since moving to greenwood village, the takeout service has been less than mediocre. I called to let Shaun, the manager, know that every time we order from there, something is wrong on the order. Instead of offering an apology and reassurance that it wouldn&#39;t happen again, he said that it was a mistake and ppl make mistakes and he can&#39;t change the other times that it happened and that its just apart of life. I was appalled at his lack of concern and said we would not be returning to this location.

It was yummy! I always test burgers by the traditional or standard burger they offer. Sometimes when they load all that crap on you can&#39;t truly tell if it&#39;s decent. I&#39;m not a fan of ketchup so substituted for the big daddy sauce. This sauce made the burger! It&#39;s a mayo base with bbq and chipotle. Great flavor. I had tater tots and smothered with green chili. Loved it all. Hubs had the bad ass burger. I don&#39;t recommend this at all. It&#39;s huge and has buttermilk fried bacon. Just looking at his burger was a heart attack waiting to happen. I took a bite and it was greasy. His fries were good and crisp...So the 4 star rating is only based on my meal not his.

First I got a Bloody Mary and yummy. Anything with bacon taste good. It was spicy and really filled the spot. 

Food. 
Started with the green Chile cheese fries. Tasty and lots of cheese, would have preferred more green chilies but it still had a little kick and would get again.  I got the tuna burger. It was sushi grade ground tuna and cooked rare. First I would have preferred it to be a tuna steak, more meaty. The slaw that came with it was tasty and had a great ginger flavor. I ended up not eating the bun as it was too much. 
Hubby. He had the bacon burger and it is big but tasty and Juicy. 

We sat at the bar and the service was good. 

Be warned that when the door opens you do get a nice breeds so remember a sweater. Or have an extra drink.

They just opened up but seem to be running pretty smoothly.  As usual we sat at the bar.  They have some of their own creations for burgers but we opted to create our own.  They make it efficient to do so, you fill out the slip on your table marking off whatever toppings, sauces, etc you would like and it&#39;s taken back to the kitchen.  The burgers were pretty good, for a side we each got tater tots which everyone we spoke to that worked there raved about.  Their tap list is huge with only one handle not being a Colorado beer which I appreciate quite a bit.  And although we didn&#39;t indulge, they have alcoholic milkshakes too!

They serve local brews on tap such as Odell&#39;s.  They have happy hour from 3-6pm.  We tried the Pittsburg burger which was cooked perfectly at medium and was still juicy...the burger is topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and shoestring fries.  All the burgers come with a side which we hose tater tots and hand cut french fries.  Both burgers also came with a little dipping sauce that tasted like honey mustard and bbq...sweet but with a little zing.  We also got the chefs special for December which was the magic mushroom burger (truffle aioli, arugula, four types of sautéed mushrooms).  They did a great job with cooking and presentation and service.  The only thing was the fries were a little over salted. I would definitely go back."

I appreciate their clever burger creations (italian burger with mozzarella &amp; pesto, western with bbq &amp; onion straws, patty-melt-style, etc.) but nothing really spoke to me so I made a custom burger with mushrooms and swiss.  Apparently they have a burger of the month and December features a mushroom burger with four different varieties of mushrooms, including yummy morels - so I will have to go back. 

The Bad A$$ burger that my husband had was overrated.  The buttermilk fried bacon was impractical (burger was 6 inches tall) and not too tasty.  The burger did not taste seasoned (simple salt &amp; pepper) and the bacon was over-fried and near the burned side.  Side choices also left much to be desired.  Would love to see some more alluring sides because after having the average sweet potato fries and the average homemade potato chips, not much else interests me.  Maybe the slaw?

Favs were the homemade chili - great proportion of meat to tomatoes to beans.  Well done!  And HATS OFF TO THE MARGARITA.  A good Marg is the key to my heart, so this will keep me coming back for sure.  How can you beat a $6 margarita with a limit of 2 - you know they are strong, but more importantly, tasty!

Server was knowledgeable, pleasant, and friendly, but over-attentive.  If I wanted to chat with my server 90% of my meal, I would eat at the bar.  :)"

The burger business is competitive and they need to up their game if they want to stay in business in this tech center location.

I cannot turn down such a request, so we stopped in to check this place out. The atmosphere is awesome. I like the look and feel of the place.  The staff were attentive and eager to assist at anytime during your visit. At one point I saw about 8 staff members in just the small area we were in checking on people, monitoring other staff members to make sure everything was up to par and running food/drinks. Great wait staff! We perused the menu and I settled with building my own burger.  On each table they have a pad of paper with all of the options and you can just check your life away on what toppings you want to make your burger yours. I went with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, american cheese, ketchup and garlic mayo. I heart garlic and when I saw that as an option, I had to check the box. Brian got the Oktoberfest Bratwurst burger. Holy cow! That thing was massive! And messy! Mine was messy as well, which of course is a good thing when it comes to a burger.

The first person didn&#39;t know. The second person said oh no just come on in you never have to wait on a Saturday night. It&#39;s a restaurant in landmark. Of course there&#39;s a wait on a Saturday night. 
Needless to say we showed up at 6 and were told it would be 15-25 minutes for our large group. There&#39;s not a lot of room to wait and as people swarmed in behind us, it became incredibly tight for everyone to wait and the hostess to get people to their table.  When our buzzer finally went off, they only had us down for a group of 3. We had to wait an additional time for a booth that they squeezed us into (uncomfortably) and with a chair at the end. 
The staff was friendly and the food was good. First impression was rough, but I won&#39;t stay away forever. The bad ass margarita was delicious and the chipotle ranch is excellent."

First off, great happy hour specials - house margarita was beyond delish and only $5. Also, as other reviewers mention, the fried pickles are amazing! Probably best we&#39;ve ever had. Hubby and I shared the Big Ass Burger which is 10 oz and ridiculous if anyone ate that on their own. It was so yummy. Daughter got the Western BBQ and other Daughter got the sliders. We also tried the happy hour wings and they were just as good as everything else. Seriously, we couldn&#39;t stop talking about this place as our now go-to burger place.

We also ordered the truffle fries (a bit salty, but tasty), and a Wrangler burger and the Bad Ass burger. I probably won&#39;t order the Bad Ass burger again, because the fried bacon just tasted like fried stuff, not bacon or seasoned breading. But the burger was delicious without it.

Our server was good - a bit of delay in getting my beer to the table, but that was due to her being under age and couldn&#39;t serve it. The homemade potato chips and fried pickles were fantastic. We all loved our burgers - we ordered sliders, the Ricotta burger (that was good but too much cheese for my liking) and the Patty Melt (not inexpensive, but very good quality). And to finish it, they let us split the Elvis shake amongst the four of us - which was all each of us needed (and it was so delish I likely would have devoured the entire thing on my own!).

The service was great -- we had two waiters assigned to our table, and they were a perfect mix of helpful and hilarious.  Their food recommendations were spot-on as well:  our burgers were fantastic (and enormous), the fried pickles were great, and their house sauce would make a piece of cardboard taste delicious.

On our way out, everyone we walked past (hostess, servers, manager, etc.) was very friendly and wished us a good night.  Not something you see very often, and it was very nice.

They have a guy sitting in the middle of the coffee shop-a place people come to talk or get work done-loudly playing guitar and singing incredibly off key. I honestly can&#39;t believe they would let someone busk IN the coffee shop, it&#39;s incredibly unprofessional and just downright unpleasant. I profoundly regret that I decided I could try and get work done in spite of it-I should have just turned around and walked out the door."

I love that it&#39;s family owned. I love how cozy comfy the seating arrangements are.  I love how personable they are to everyone that comes in. They even more nicely educated me  (compared to that other coffee chain previously mentioned) on what it is I always seek to get out of my cappuccinos. I like mine &#34;dry&#34;... I mean foam peaks so high you can stick a spoon in there and eat it like dessert. That&#39;s precisely how I get mine every time I go in there, with velvety caramel laced throughout the foam. They never fail! They&#39;re foam is fancier and taste better than even the stuff I&#39;ve gotten in the fancy coffee shops of Portland! I tried some of my daughter&#39;s Horchata that the barista was so nice to recommend for her since she is 15yrs old and horribly indecisive. YUM! I just went in there today and the young gal smiled at me and said, &#34;The usual?&#34;. Oh snap! It&#39;s clearly official; and funny thing is, I go there maybe once every other week if that. But when you are paying attention to your customers like that, even the infrequent ones like myself - you clearly give a hoot. Thus, you get my loyal return business! Love this place! 

Ooh forgot: The veggie breakfast burritos in the FOIL wrap? There is another one they offer in a white paper wrap, but I don&#39;t like as much. However the one they sell in the foil wrapping?! WOW!!! Award winning and understandably so. YOU MUST TRY!!!

When I told the manager (Angela) that I hadn&#39;t been in because I didn&#39;t want to chance getting something I didn&#39;t like since I&#39;m not a fan of soy, she offered me an almond milk latte, no strings.  If I didn&#39;t like it, she&#39;d make me something else.  This kind of thoughtful service and willingness to help customers find the perfect drink is why I am a customer for life.

Yes you are surrounded by strip malls and such and yes you are not a Starbucks and yes you have local kaladi beans. Your Ccoffee drinks are pretty good and I&#39;d much rather be here then Starbucks.  The owners are very friendly and I respect that they are a local business surrounded by an area of corporate food domination.  None of the pastries or food are made in house but they are also local and come from several local bakeries.  The latin style drinks do add variety and some unique flavor to the drink menu. There is plenty of seating and a bit of an older more conservative crowd here. There are plenty of electric outlets and its quiet which makes a good  space to get work done. Every Saturday they have live music too. I&#39;d go here again for coffee because it&#39;s close to where I live.  The burritos you have in your case boast around 50 ingredients about half of which sound like a chemical experiment.  I wish it had a better food selection so I could give it another star or 2!  Still a good place in a land of strip malls.

I ordered the pizza with egg and pistachio. I figured if they offer something that strange, it must be because it&#39;s really good. It wasn&#39;t though. The flavors weren&#39;t balanced, and it was too rich with no herbs or spices. The kale salad wasn&#39;t that great either. I heard this place was good, so maybe it&#39;s just what I ordered.

I cannot really call this authentic since the menu features many dishes that will never be found in Italy...the chicken Parmigiana being just one...

But the food was very delicious. 

We ordered a tray of cold cuts from the appetizers section, which coincidentally was discounted because we landed there during happy hour, SCORE! ;-) The prosciutto was not really prosciutto di Parma as on the menu, but it was pretty ok. The tapenade selection was very tasty and authentic to what one could expect to get in Italy. The cheese we were served with the tray was supposed to be Crescenza, but honestly it had nothing to do with the gooey-deliciousness from Italy. It was a soft cheese, but sort of grainy. They also had put olive oil and pepper on it...which I have never seen done in my country. So I am not sure. It could very well be some regional specialty that I am not aware of...but it is definitely not what nation-wide we refer as Crescenza. That deliciousness have yet to be found in the new continent...at least by me.

We also ordered the fig, prosciutto and arugula pizza. It was a very good pizza. This would also not be very traditional pizza in Italy, but one could very well find it in a fancy pizzeria. So I felt that it was more authentic than the cold cuts platter in a way. 

Overall very good food, very attentive servers (maybe even a bit too much) and good deals to be had if one shows up mid afternoon for lunch. So I give this a 4 star review. I hope to be back :)"

On my first visit I dined alone and had a breakfast sandwich and a good strong latte that was sometime last year.

Since then, I went back in the past month with my mom and it was during one of these snowstorms in April. We came in on a Sunday around 1 pm. We stopped in and were seated at a 4-top table in the middle of the restaurant. Our server was immediately attentive and took our drink orders. I had a bellini and my mother had iced tea.

Then we hashed out the brunch menu and I ended up with the baked French toast with a side of scrambled eggs and bacon and my mom had Nonna&#39;s casserole. The French toast was exquisite. It was so good, but man the bread fills me up so quick. My mom really enjoyed the casserole, although she did wish for more sausage in the casserole.

We also ordered an appetizer of the lemon donuts to be served prior to the rest of our food coming out. Well, somehow our donuts never made it out to the table. We reminded our server of the donuts and she brought them out later and comped the donuts, which I thought was very nice. We thoroughly enjoyed the donuts too. After two visits, I say North Italia gets five stars!"

The hostesses welcomed us and immediately sat us at a small table. The waiter showed up within minutes with friendly greetings and asked us few questions. He was attentive and able to answer our questions regarding the menu. I asked him which pasta he recommended and we ask for two of them: Short Ribs Radiatori and Burrata Tortelloni. Both were delicious! The ribs pasta seemed a bit light while the latter was a bit heavy in a good way. Best part is: the food was made from scratch, definitely worth our money. We plan to come back here again soon."

I have since recovered from my north &#34;sickness of 2005&#34; and decided to give them another try. Our new friends had raved about how delicious their previous meal here was and wanted to try their dinner options. 

We meet around 7pm on a Tuesday night and the restaurant is packed. We opt to wait on the patio for a few drinks while our table was ready (drinks were a bit weak, although tasty, but with a $10 price tag). They ended up seating us in the back of the restaurant in front of a big window. The atmosphere was perfect. It was not too loud for conversation which is a big plus in my book. 

We started off with the arancini (risotto balls) and they were great, we enjoyed the zucca chips as well, but there isn&#39;t much to them so I wouldn&#39;t order them as my only appetizer. My honey and I split the spinach tortellini, which was made in house, it was excellent. Friends enjoyed the lasagna and spaghetti, no one had a bad thing to say about their meals. 

Last but not least the service was impeccable. Would absolutely return."

I love the wine size options- glass, glass and a half, or full bottle. We ordered drinks and ordered a couple of small plates prior to our meal- 
Zucca chips- YES. Light, little zucchini chips with really nice flavor. 
Crisp calamari- Great flavor, perfectly fried. 
Black Mediterranean Mussels- If you like mussels, GET THIS. The flavor was unreal. I grabbed one knowing they&#39;d be passed around the table, but when they came back to my side after I tried the first one, I took 5 more. YUM. 
Truffle Garlic Bread- Pull apart cheesy, garlic bread in a piping hot cask iron pan. If you&#39;re into garlic bread, this will be your jam. 

For dinner, I got a simple salad and the squid ink mafaldine. My friends, although everyone loved their food, I would say I had the best meal on the table. 
The salad was a really great house salad- the toasted pine nuts and the gorgonzola vinaigrette were just so good. But the real winner was my pasta. This dish definitely has a targeted audience- it&#39;s full of calamari and shrimp with squid ink in the actual pasta. And it is SPICY. The server ensured I knew it was a spicy dish before I ordered, but it was definitely spicier than I expected. Not for the faint of heart, but REALLY, really good. Also, am I the only one who has never tried mafaldine pasta before? Their pasta is made fresh in house daily and the mafaldine was so, so good. Thick, long, crimpy noodles. I just loved it. 

Great atmosphere. Very nice service. Would come back anytime I&#39;m in the area and would recommend. Wish I would have grabbed some photos, but didn&#39;t want to be &#34;that guy&#34; on the work trip."

How awesome is that? It&#39;s very difficult to find a restaurant that can boasts of such offer.

You can choose to sit outside or inside. No worries if you decide to sit outside. The service is top notch. Fast, attentive and genuine.

We ordered a few small plates: Braised Meatballs, Calamari, Truffle Garlic Bread and Caesar salad. 

The Braise Meatballs came with Grilled Bread and Red Sauce. It was one of the best six pieces of meatballs I&#39;ve had. The sauce sealed the deal. There&#39;s nothing added to it to make it taste less than what it should be. Just red sauce that&#39;s well seasoned. The Calamari was perfectly crunchy and was mixed in with fresh arugula lightly dressed in lemon vinaigrette. It&#39;s an awesome juxtaposition of fried and healthy. Combined together end result was an explosive great, healthy, guilt free dish. The Truffle Garlic bread came in a medium size skillet. All brown and crunchy with an obvious amount of garlic stuck to the entwined truffle infused bread. The Caesar salad that we shared was lightly moist with dressing and rained on with a good amount of fine mozzarella goodness.

Everything was great. I can&#39;t pick a favorite. They do carry pizza as well and to that note we decided to do dinner here sometime soon. 

In this area if you feel like some Ottimo Cibo drop by! I am a big fan!"

It has a vast assortment of cheese, jams, prosciutto, nuts, toasted bread and veges. This was a large board recommended for 3-4 people. We had two people so it was a bit too much.

The salad was a healthy size and very tasty as well, recommended for 3 people to share.

Lastly, each of the entrees were very well crafted as well. The Mediterranean fish was very light and fresh. The pasta was all handmade and flavorful.

A rustic-modern Italian place that uses fresh ingredients and makes all pastas and sauces in house daily is always a win in my book.

Felt a little rushed hence only 4 stars and not 5- our server was nice enough but some of the food was coming out a little too fast. We had the cheese tortellini and the NY strip and just shared everything. The strip was good and cooked to temp, I didn&#39;t really like the potatoes that came with the dish, they were pretty boring potatoes- just standard baby reds.

Overall good place, will definitely make it back."

I have been here for dinner once, and lunch/happy hour on multiple occasions. Their meatballs are so so good, and so is any dish that comes with their lemon parmesan potatoes!

The bottle and board for $20 is a deal. They do not skimp on anything, the cheese plates are very robust and the pizzas are huge. Its all bar seating so try and get in well before 6 to make sure you can take advantage of the happy hour selection.

If you miss happy hour the food is still delicious, a little more pricey than an average dinner but its worth the money. I&#39;d recommend making a reservation as its full almost every night.

I was going to have pasta until I heard the white (garlic) special pizza.  Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, salumi, and greens.  I love Gorgonzola on pizza so I switched to that. Family had cheese pizza&#39;s.  All was good.  The wine list is improved from what I remember.  They have &#34;Orange&#34; wines.   Including the father of Orange wines, Gravners.  (Though they say Amber, not Orange). Impressive and uncommon.  I hope they continue to build the Italian wine list.  If I could do 3.5 stars I would do that. I&#39;m just not at 4 yet.

My friend had the scallops and they were divine. A bit on the salty side for my taste but really good. And LARGE.

I went here with some coworkers when we had big-wigs in town and holy moley have I been missing out! I had the slow cooked short rib with a glass of Prosecco and wowwww. So delicious. The short rib was so tender that you could eat it with a spoon. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the polenta has the perfect consistency--not too solid but not too creamy either. 

Our table shared the Bombolini and Salted Caramel Budino for dessert, and even thought I was stuffed beyond believe, the few bites I had of each were outstanding.

Aside from their delicious food, the restaurant is located in Cherry Creek North which is great for walking around since they are full of shops &amp; other restaurants. The restaurant is very big and open. The interior is beautiful &amp; authentic, with red brick walls and wood paneling, rustic furniture, and soft lighting. 

Service was great. Dan took care of us and was extremely friendly and gave us great recommendations from the menu. We also got a bottle of wine at 1/2 off since we came in on a Sunday, whoo! My friend and I shared:

- Complimentary Bread Service: The bread was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Served with sun dried tomato spread, which was pretty tasty! 
- Arahcini: Mushroom risotto and scamorza cheese, rolled into a ball and lightly fried. The combination of cheese &amp; risotto inside made it so creamy and rich! The dish is also served with tomato sauce which tasted great and added more flavor. Highly recommend this appetizer!
- Slow Cooked Short Rib: The roasted vegetables and creamy white polenta tasted better than the short rib in my opinion. The short rib tasted dry and lacked in flavor. I think it could have used a glaze to moisten the meat and complete the dish.
- Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs: Absolutely loved this dish. The portion was pretty big so you could definitely share it with someone. The meatballs were moist and seasoned very well. The spaghetti noodles were thick and perfectly cooked. And the tomato sugo tasted so fresh. The basil and pecorino cheese were excellent added ingredients.
- Olive Oil Cake: I know it sounds weird, but their olive oil cake was so good! Very simple cake, but so moist and sweet and addicting!!! You have to try olive oil cake if you&#39;ve never had it!"

Friendly staff, typical clean trendy décor of Cherry Creek. 

On this cold date I had a latte to fight off the cold which was good and the small plate of Chefs Platter as an entrée which it was surprising for me to order since I didn&#39;t know what to get since there were many items I wanted to try and this was not a warm option. It made me think of something that I would actually eat at a café in Italy...very simple, yet great flavors especially when mixed together....While I was trying to stay away from the bread I did mix together a couple of delights with the crusty grilled bread.  The prosciutto went very well with the homemade mozzarella, marinated peppers, delightful fresh parmesan, and fruit spread.  I followed bites up with the roasted almonds and bites of olives.  This simple platter was a dish I was eating slowly and savoring every bite....just like you would do in a café in Europe with no rush.  

My husband got the omelet of the day which looked delicious as well with bacon, avocado and cheese.  It came with crusty bread with shredded parmesan and breakfast potatoes.  I would have been stabbed with a fork if I took anything else, but I did have a bite of the potatoes which were flavored nicely that I wouldn&#39;t have wanted any ketchup on them.

A nice unexpected stop for the day.  I will have to come back to try some of their items as looking at a couple of the other dishes going by they looked really good."

Date of Visit: 8/6/15

Checked out North with some friends for Happy Hour, and was very impressed. The space is much larger than I expected, and is done in &#34;farmhouse chic&#34; (raw materials, metal work, funky lighting), which is a favorite style of mine. That said, the food and service were just as great.

We ordered a few of the HH items, including the Chef&#39;s Board (meats, cheeses, &#34;other goodies&#34;), a few pizzas (Margherita, daily special - Fig/Chicken - pizza). The pizza was fresh and bright, with a light, airy crust that I would put against almost any I&#39;ve had in the area. The only demerit would be their drink list, which could use a bit more adventurism in the beer department. Other than that, North Italia really hit the mark."

This place is amazing.  Their food is just so tasty.  You really cannot go wrong, except to get stuffed on the appetizers (guilty).

Their meatballs and zucchini chips are a must.  
They make all their pasta in house. I had the squid-ink pasta and was mesmerized.

Finally Sunday night to try it out and noticed they have all day happy hour on their website so we walked in at 7pm. We had our dog so we wanted a patio spot and the hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait. There were tons of patio tables open. We waited the full 20 minutes and were seated at a table that was open the entire time. We ordered off the happy hour menu (had to ask for it, knowing we saw it on their website as HH all day Sunday but no one offered it to us) and ordered. One hour later we received the $5 bruschetta (one piece of toast that my boyfriend and I consumed in 2 minutes) and a $8 margarita pizza that was 90% bread with barely any sauce
Or cheese. I get that the dinner crowd that is spending more Money is your Sunday evening focus but don&#39;t offer happy hour and treat those coming in for it any less than anyone else. Your waitress was awesome but the food was awful considering the time we waited and definitely not worth the $35 we spent.

They call themselves and Italian restaurant but they are more like just a pizza restaurant.
Best dish we had : a salad.
The lasagna was average and the shrimp pasta was tasteless.
Also, how you ruin a restaurant reputation? Letting a waiter stand over a service station (where you have glasses and silverware) with her street shoes - see picture.

I am not picky on this things, but considering reputation, food quality, price and location this is a two stars at best."

Was invited back by the GM and me and my friend had received some generosities. Most of the restaurants could have done nothing so I was pleasantly surprised. 
They also carry the Pinot Noir from Melville winery in Santa Barbara just like true foods. Pricey yet worth every penny. Had to admit I have been addicted to the nutty front note of this red when I usually go for the white.

We both got the scrambled eggs. It was quite flavorful and you can&#39;t go wrong with asparagus, zucchini, mushroom and spinach. I also had the tomato based seafood soup with a slight spice to it and it was delightful."

My guest ordered the Atlantic salmon and said it was cooked perfectly. We both were so impressed with this place and agreed we were definitely coming back! We even took some zucca chips home!"
north-italia-denver,Melissa I.,YfaY3DZF5rDBe2FB9FM0oA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,34,55,Ya2xubjM73WKfLn3gHgeDQ,3.0,2015-02-21,"I&#39;m starting with dessert first, because that was the highlight of my meal. The salted caramel budino was incredible, INCREDIBLE! I would come back just for it (and I probably will!). 

The asparagus, prosciutto and creamy cheese bruschetta was the best my husband has ever had! I started with the beet salad, and it was okay. I may have rated it better than &#34;okay&#34;, except I had to compare it to my husband&#39;s bruschetta, which was just phenomenal. 

I am a big fan of homemade pasta, and I feel like that is a rare find. However, I was underwhelmed with the bolognese. The best way we could describe it was being &#34;light in flavor&#34;, and not in a good way. I know that authentic Italian is different than what we&#39;re used to in America, but I thought that had to do more with a light dressing of sauce, but not lacking in flavor. I&#39;m traveling to Italy in April, so I may have to come and revise my review after that trip. ;o)

Hubs was pleased with the wine menu. He selected a Malbec (the pricier one; I&#39;m not seeing their wine menu online). As I&#39;m finding is common in Denver, the beer menu was IPA-heavy. I lucked out that the seasonal rotation from Fat Tire was their Portage, so at least I had one dark beer to choose from aside from Guinness. 

I&#39;d come back. I think I&#39;ll try their pizzas next time. I&#39;d love to give another one of their homemade pastas a chance, but I&#39;m afraid it might be a waste of money again. I&#39;ll see what strikes my fancy at the time. One thing for sure is that I&#39;ll be saving some room for the budino!"

We needed a table for 13, and they were cheerfully accommodating. We had three kids with us and the kids menu is great. They also didn&#39;t blink at ordering kids food ahead. 

Everyone ordered different entrees and raved about them. I had spaghetti and meatballs. Just perfect. The chicken was divine (I tasted husbands food).  The appetizers were also unique and tasty. 

Great wine choices. 
Desserts included the donuts (oh.my.god.) and the gelato.  We will be regulars."

The location and vibe are both good. The waitstaff are much more friendly than the greeters.

I said at the bar and was taking care of by a very nice man. The food is all right it&#39;s nouveau Italian American cuisine. It could be priced more competitively though. 

My one recommendation is to order the iced tea."

I had dinner with a colleague this evening and can I saw WoW?! We started out with the mussels, which were divine. The garlic and butter sauce was delicious. My main course was the scallops, which were seasoned and seared to perfection. They were jumbo scallops sitting on a bed of sweet corn risotto, which was the highlight of my night. Olive oil cake to finish the dinner with perfectly ripened orange and strawberry topped with mascarpone. The service was top notch.

A few miles away from downtown Denver via car, motorcycle or light rail. It&#39;s in the lovely shopping area of the town within Denver-- Glendale. 

A fancy, yet casual atmosphere with indoor outdoor, bar-top or community seating wherever I please? My boyfriend will probably get his standard, Bolognese. 

If they don&#39;t have that, can he get the meatballs and spaghetti? In fact, make that two! One for our friend who likes simple sometimes but isn&#39;t biased towards your entire menu!

What&#39;s that you say? Your chickens were running antibiotic, hormone and cage free!? A free range chicken Strozzapreti sounds perfect for me! 

The pasta is made in-house, daily and fresh; smothered in pine nuts, mushrooms, spinach, and Parmesan?! My mouth is getting watery-- oh please, oh please, don&#39;t make me wait too long!?

I had my service dog with me, and the hostess said service dogs are fine. After being seated, a server approached the table and told me that dogs aren&#39;t allowed. I informed him that the hostess said it was ok, and he literally rolled his eyes and said &#34;I guess,&#34; and then went through the specials unenthusiastically. Never in my life have I walked away from a restaurant before even eating, but the attitude from the server was completely unacceptable."

To be fair, I only tried a limited part of the menu. The zucca chips didn&#39;t do it for me, and I love zucchini. The bruschetta, like prior reviewers noted, was totally meh, on the most plain white non-crusty white French bread -- totally underwhelming. The free bread pre-meal was far better, and I don&#39;t know why they wouldn&#39;t use the same for the bruschetta. The happy hour wines: had a glass of red, completely average at best. Tried a splash of the white and the sangria, could not bring myself to order a glass of either one. But the waitress was incredibly pleasant and well deserving of the 30% tip. I&#39;ve been to restaurants where they pour a really nice happy hour wine, and you know what? I have a few glasses and gladly spend more money. The first thing North can do to improve is to upgrade the HH wines, even if that means charging a couple extra bucks per glass. Everyone knows you&#39;re supposed to loosen up with the good booze first, then disinhibition kicks in, then $$$ is spent. At North, neither the food nor the beverage impressed me. I cut my losses and will be having a full dinner elsewhere."

Very often, Cherry Creek lives up to its stereotype of being an expensive, pretentious neighborhood that&#39;s overloaded with art galleries and women in overpriced Lululemon gear (I have never paid that much for a pair of yoga pants in my life). However, I&#39;ve recently discovered that there&#39;s also a lot of great food to be had in Cherry Creek -- and great in a foodie way, not in a &#34;I just paid $50 for this steak, so it must be good&#34; kind of way. One of the places I definitely recommend visiting is North Italia, which is a more modern, upbeat version of your traditional Italian restaurant (but still with delicious, made-from-scratch Italian food). And it&#39;s surprisingly not expensive!

THE ATMOSPHERE &amp; PEOPLE
Maybe I&#39;ve judged Cherry Creek too much, but I was pleasantly surprised by how &#34;cool&#34; it was in here. Apparently, North gets pretty packed on a daily basis. It has a fun, upbeat buzz that makes it a really great place to come with friends or on a date (and oh man, the stories I could tell you about the couple that was on a 1st date at the bar next to me!). And the staff is young and friendly and great to chat with (if you&#39;re sitting at the bar). I really couldn&#39;t find anything to even complain about (which is pretty rare for me).

FOOD &amp; DRINKS
There&#39;s some great Italian wines here (duh), but I would also highly recommend trying the Julietta cocktail (even though it&#39;s $10). I&#39;m a sucker for cocktails with herb- or spice-infused liquor. And this is a vanilla- and ginger-infused Smirnoff with St. Germain, lime, and prosecco. It may look a little girly, but guy or girl, you should give it a try.

If you knew me, you&#39;d know how hard it was for me not to get the beef short ribs ($25) or the prosciutto-wrapped pork tenderloin ($22). Especially for those prices. But the &#34;Bolognese&#34; is the house specialty, so I felt like on my first visit here, I had to give it a try. And oh man am I glad I did. For just $16, you get a bowl of made-from-scratch pasta smothered in an amazing meat sauce, and topped with grana padano cheese. It definitely tastes like it&#39;s made-from-scratch and is bursting with great Italian flavors, and even though it&#39;s not your traditional Spaghetti Bolognese because it&#39;s made with a flat pasta, I actually like this better. A flat pasta just holds meat much better than a slippery round noodle (and it&#39;s important to get all that meat!) ;)

HAPPY HOUR
If your concern is more about the price, North also has a great Happy Hour (3-6pm Mon-Fri and all day Sunday). You can get $4 glasses of wine or sangria, $16 bottles/pitchers, $3-$4 snacks, $8 pizzas, a $10 board of meat/cheese, or a $20 bottle+pizza or bottle+board. That&#39;s really pretty hard to beat as far as happy hours go. And in Cherry Creek!"

Home made pasta and sauces were simply outstanding and a staff that bent backwards to attend to our daughters veggie needs. Staff is very personal - taking time to engage and know about you and your dining needs.  Portions are too much to eat.  We ordered a pizza of the day - salami and arugula drizzled with balsamic, wife ordered strozaperetti- chicken, cream sauce and fresh pasta, simply superb. Deserts were equally excellent - highly recommend the salted caramel and marscapone.  

Maya was a superb waitress - my highest compliments!

Cons: Drinks were slightly watered down. We got the molto fresco, which was a nice cocktail but didn&#39;t feel like it lived up to the name of being the most popular drink at North. The other drinks we got were mediocre, with the exception of the merlot, which was pretty smooth."

We shared the Chef&#39;s Board appetizer ($15).  It had assorted cheeses, meats, marcona almonds, green olives, sweet peppers, apricot spread with slices of bread presented on a wooden cutting board.  It was plenty of food for lunch.

We then shared a Tiramisu.  It came in a clear glass dish with chocolate crispy balls on top which gave it some texture.  It wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but my husband really liked it.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s had a tiramisu he hasn&#39;t liked.

Recently, after having some serioussss food envy over their pizzas (I&#39;m gluten-free and sadly can&#39;t partake) I tried their roasted vegetable salad and added a piece of salmon on top... SO good.

YES, this establishment can be pricey or fancy to some.  YES, sometimes the PARKING outside can be some what &#34;NIGHTMARE-ISH&#34;...  But NORTH has shine thru in my books.

I have been to NORTH sometime back ago, and DEFINITELY that Short Rib Hash was indeed calling my name.  I made a reservation for our Meetup group.  That recent visit was on Sunday January 26th 2014.  Time for the Brunch with the group was for 11:00hrs.  By the time, I arrived at this establishment about 10:45hrs ish, our table was ready for our group.

Our main server his name is Phil.  His service was indeed outstanding, and impeccable.  Everyone has water and Phil makes sure all our water is filled without us asking him.  Thankfully, we managed to have SEPARATE CHECKS for everyone at the Table.  Definitely GOOD in my books.  SCORE!

I was a little apprehensive to recommend this establishment to my friends, coz alot of my Meetup friends have been to ITALY itself, and they may have big expectations about what NORTH can offer.  Thankfully, Everyone like the order of their food.

From the Simple Extensive Menu For Brunch, I opt to have the following items :

*  Crisp Calamari ($11)
*  Short Rib Hash ($12)

The food came out at a timely manner.  From what I could recall, my friends ordered these following items :

*  Grilled Artichokes ($12)
*  Pig Pizza ($15)
*  Short Rib Hash ($12)
*  Egg Scramble ($10)
*  Frittata ($9)

My friends also order a couple Brunch Cocktails, Coffee, and Jump Start as their beverages. 

As for me, this establishment can get 5 stars but that morning, the Short Rib Hash was a little too salty for my liking.  The Crisp Calamari, though came out hot, did not really came out Crispy coz it was embedded with the philes of Arugula.  The Crisp Calamari also comes with 2 Slices of Charred Lemons.  YES, you can have your Vegetables and Seafood, as protein for this appetizer.  It would be nice, if my Calamari comes just with Calamari, and perhaps the Arugula on the side.  With the Arugula, the Calamari were a little too soggy for my liking.

All in all, until now I don&#39;t know why I am in &#34;love&#34; with the Short Rib Hash.  Maybe the Chef, put &#34;CRACK&#34; in the Short Rib Hash.  Indeed it was so tender, MELT in the mouth moments... when you break the Egg Yolk, it oozes out, that requires the Crusty Bread and dipped the Oozing Goodness, that comes along with this Dish...

Ooohh next time if I were to return for BRUNCH again, I&#39;ll come back DEFINITELY have to make full use of the Happy Hour (SUNDAY ALL DAY), coz they also offer Yucca Chips and Pizza for reasonable pricing.  DOUBLE SCORE!

At the end of the Brunch, 2 of my friends opt to have Desserts which was Nutella Chocolate Truffle Tart, that consists of Nutella Cream Mousse, and Marcona Almond Crunch.  It looks decadent, NOT too sweet, yet I bet you, it was indeed DEFINITELY Devine!

By the time, I was about to leave this establishment at about 12:30hrs ish, many more Patrons enjoying their Brunch/Lunch hour and this establishment filled up easily.

Party of 9 and included the kids tonight - everyone loved it, which was a huge consideration in choosing a restaurant. We tried a ton of items, and I suggest that you should definitely try these: 

+ Grilled artichoke - divine!
+ Calamari - flash fried, not heavy at all, and mixed with arugula - yum!!   
+ Chef board - the chutney and cheese are fabulous along with the crowd-pleasing selection of meats
+ Simple salad - the BEST &#39;house&#39; salad of any restaurant! 
+ Scallops - over celery root risotto...three people ordered these and the vote was unanimous, &#34;THUMBS UP!&#34;
+ Short ribs - whether in Denver or Tucson or Scottsdale, these are the BOMB! 
+ Beet salad - not your typical beet salad, and the lemon creme fraiche is a delightful addition to the layers of flavors!!

The kids loved the house made spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parmesan.   

This restaurant stepped up after a misunderstanding about whether they could honor my reservation on a night when they also had a buyout (where a private party books the entire restaurant). Appreciate very much that they remedied the situation, and look forward to coming back!"

Don&#39;t get me wrong but its unheard of to find a place where they seem to enjoy their careers.

That being said. North has great Italian. The cheese board is an ever changing bunch of goodness that is best consumed with a carafe of excellent Sangria.

Pig pizza is an excellent sharer

Any pasta is good, they make them there. For instance spaghetti and meatballs boring right? Wrong, they just execute it perfectly. I love meat sauce and was bummed the menu didn&#39;t have meatballs with meat sauce. My most helpful server suggested that option and said the kitchen would be happy to comply --- NICE!

My wife had the butternut squash ravioli. Its part of the summer menu so I am not sure you can get it. Its pretty fantastic almost bordering on dessert with a sweet brown butter sauce that maybe best for people other than me who meet frequently with their cardiologist. It is so rich and silky that it might be best shared.

Zucca chips. If Frito Lay had these first we would all be eating zucchini instead of corn.

This place has an excellent vibe and it is truly enhanced by the staff&#39;s attitude. I would bet it is a happy hour favorite of the Cherry Creek crowd.

North is a Fox concept restaurant... I am not that Fox but I have considered implying I am Ala Chevy Chase in National Lampoons vacation to see what happens :)"

We made an impromptu lunch visit and my husband I both loved the atmosphere right off the bat.  When we saw a plate of pizza pass by we were instantly sold.  And then neither of us ended up ordering pizza, go figure!

Our waiter was really enthusiastic and we appreciated his energy.  Plus he brought out fresh bread and sundried tomato butter within minutes of being there so yes, yes please.  Husband got the meatball sandwich and while he ended up making a mess eating it, it looked mouthwateringly good.  I sampled the potatoes that came on the side and WHOA, those things are good.

As for me, I saw the Seasonal Salad had kale, Brussels sprouts and goat cheese and say no more, I want that.  It was just as good, fresh and goat-cheesy as I&#39;d hoped it would be.  I had this idea in my head that North was expensive and maybe it is for dinner but our bill was all of $23 and I can&#39;t argue with that.  I&#39;m so glad we got to try North.  I can add it to my list of Cherry Creek favorites!"

Great modern Italian dining with a casual yet refined atmosphere. The ambiance is very cool with dim lighting and the space is fairly large. We started with the Zucca chips- so good, literally melt in your mouth. I had the spinach cheese tortellini for my main course. Sooo delicious and very filling. My two friends had the bolognese and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our server was a nice girl.. although, she tried to sell us a bottle of wine that was &#34;just $80&#34; while the regular wine menu contained bottles priced at $55 and less. Far too obviously advantageous for our liking and only reason I did not give 5 stars. Will eat here again."

- How is the food?  (Quite good, though some items were over complicated a bit)
- Is it priced appropriately?  (Well, a little high, but it is a suburb of California now)

-------------------------------------------

House bread - good

Artichoke appetizer - tasty. Nicely spiced.

Chicken Salad Sandwich - this is literally chicken salad (the creamy mayo-style like potato or pasta salad) on bread. Gross.

Spicy Shrimp - pathetic. Liz H. was right on the money -- there were only four or five nickel, if not dime, sized pieces of shrimp. The rest was pasta. For $20, that&#39;s ridiculous.

Grilled Chicken Sandwich - the chicken breast was completely undercooked and pink inside.
* To be fair, the waitress tried to make up for this by comping dessert, but that doesn&#39;t fix potential salmonella.

Espresso - less than 0.5fl oz of espresso for $3.50... I know this size by eye because of my nail polish addiction. This is coffee, though. That is obscene pricing.

Tiramisu - bland. Cute presentation but very bland, vanilla pudding taste.


Nice decor inside, a couple tables outside, but the food left so much to be desired. The prices were awful on top of that."

One of our staff members coordinated with their manager (who was awesome!) to ensure premium service, efficiency, quality food and eliminate food allergen issues since we have a ton on our staff. 

I am a happy vegan and decided after everyones elaborate reviews I would join, especially since they were willing to accommodate me and my diet choices. 

I was able to pick at some of their appetizers, which were good, but nothing memorable. However, when our main course came, I was brought a fish. A mackerel to be exact and was told that this dish was vegan and was what they had arranged for me. Thanks, but NO! In its place they brought me some grilled veggies that were drowning in oil, then they charged us for both plates. 

Being in the food industry and agreeing to accommodate a vegan diet, I would hope that they would know what vegan is."

I dined here for the first time last week to celebrate a friend&#39;s new job. We made a reservation and were seated immediately. To start off, we had the Fonduta and Calamari - both were just divine! I was especially impressed with the Calamari in that it was tossed with arugula and lemon vinaigrette which I&#39;ve never had before but found it just an amazing dish - and the calamri was still very crispy :)

Between the four of us, we covered a lot of ground on the menu. The dishes we enjoyed were the Rosemary Chicken, Chicken Parmesan, Prosciutto Wrapped Pork Tenderloin, and the Seared Diver Scallops. If we could have licked our plates we would have! Everything was so delicious! The pork literally melted in your mouth, my friend raved about the sweet corn risotto which accompanied her scallops, the chicken dish was not only beautifully served but moist and the perfect sized portion for one person, and my chicken parmesan was perfect - distinguished by the rigatoni noodles served with grana padano cream - which absolutely made the dish! (The chicken parm dish is quite large so if you are looking for lighter/smaller portions any of the others I mentioned here would be a better way to go).

Well, no meal is complete without dessert! The menu sounded so good we could not decide on only one so we had the Nutella Trifle, the Tiramisu, and the Salted Caramel Budino. My personal fav - the salted caramel (oh.my.god. SOOO delicious)! I am not a huge Tiramisu person but enjoyed the few bites I had. The Nutella Trifle was definitely the runner up here to the Salted Caramel and was just the perfect mix of banana and nutella. The server did say his favorite were the Bomboini (Italian donuts) so those will be on my to-do next time around.

To note, one of our group is a VERY finicky eater and almost always finds something wrong no matter where we go (and we routinely visit fine dining establshiments) and I am not kidding, at the end of the meal she said it was the best meal she has ever had. I almost fell over (of course, the wine I had could have also played a small factor there but you get the idea).

Our service was wonderful, the restaurant is beautiful and we cannot wait to go back!

FYI - they do offer valet parking for $7."

Neither of us were big fans of the tofu soup, but everything else was a winner. 

Attentive service. Frequent water fill ups, and our waitress eventually left us with our own carafe once she noticed how much we were drinking (hubs had come from a run).

few pointer if you are newbie looking to visit

#1: try!  not the same as BCD chains at other big cities but when it comes to silken tofu in Colorado, you cannot beat it.  I am beginning to see more of non Koreans visiting this place.

#2:  if you cant not eat spicy food, let them know.  im sure they can prepare without so much spice.  for me, they are not spicy but I did see few times of others complaining being too spicy.

#3:  eggs: most of the time, they will not offer the eggs. if you like to add one raw egg cracked into the pot (in the kitchen or on the table), please request.  I forget about it too.

#4:  they do offer other non silken tofu dishes and prepared nicely.  its bit pricier compare to the silken tofu but you will get what you paid for.  

lastly, if you need something, must ask.  this is very different that most restaurants (non Korean).  don&#39;t just sit and wait :)   .. be pushy (ha ha) and ask for more water, more side dishes (I don&#39;t this they will give you extra of small fish but if you did get extra, let me know!) and finally, check.  sometimes I had to get up and go to the cashier to pay."

Did not disappoint for a first impression. Staff was friendly and interior had great decor with plenty of seating. We came as a group and all ordered the ramen noodle with oyster and clams. It came with a complimentary  small fried fish. The order included purple rice and sides consist of kimchi, fish cakes, pickled radish, and spicy squid. The order came out fast and even though there were plenty of flavors in the ramen noodle, it was not the best or even made my list to be considered good ramen. It felt as if they just opened a package of ramen noodle and put it in their bowl to serve. You&#39;ll just get one piece of oyster and some clams. I&#39;ve heard that the 1962 Tofu is a must try therefore will surely come back again for it. 
Tip: sides are unlimited. The fried fish is okay. Try the filet instead. Be aware the bbq dishes are good but are a bit pricey."

Currently, I&#39;d have to say that Korean food is my favorite. Having said that, I&#39;ve become in love with Tofu House (for the most part). 

Although a lot of other reviews cite having had bad service, I don&#39;t think my service has ever been that terrible. Usually, I&#39;ve had pretty prompt seating. But, they do lack in filling your drink. But, their food totally makes up for that. If there&#39;s a button at your table (like at many Korean restaurants), press the button and it should help get their attention. Like some other Asian restaurants, sometimes it&#39;s better to walk to the register if you&#39;re ready to leave. They&#39;ll be happy to run your payment through.    

I haven&#39;t tried any other dish than their combination tofu soup. But, this has been my go-to dish. The soup is very hearty and stays warm in the clay pot. The silken tofu is definitely one of the best parts of this dish. For the most part, the protein in the dish is pretty decent. But, I don&#39;t really like the squid/octopus they put in the soup. I can tell it&#39;s been frozen. It just lacks flavor and has a weird chew to it. As a whole, the tofu soup is really good in my opinion.

I also really liked the purple rice in the clay pot. The rice stays warm and even becomes a little crunchy (from the pot). I&#39;m also a really big fan of the fried fish that comes with your meal. On different occasions, I&#39;ve had two different types of fish with my meal. The first time was a fillet and the second time was a whole one with bones. On the whole one, some of the bones were edible (at least I ate them-getting my calcium in). I would like to see more variety in my side dishes, but it&#39;s not a deal breaker for me. Tofu House usually comes with 4-5 side dishes that rotate on different days."

I pick the fillet as suggested -- the owner mentioned the whole fish may smell more fishy. My first time eating purple rice, didn&#39;t have strong flavour as I anticipated. There were 4 side dishes: fish cake, kimchi, beansprout and japchae (fried glass noodle).

I assume the staffs are all in one family. They are a bit slow in service and fail to refill my drink *spicy food alert. But I came after lunch hour, so the experience wasn&#39;t that bad.

As a fan of K-food, I will come again to Tofu House for the seafood tofu soup. If you are not a fan of spicy, just stick with the BBQ dishes which can be pricey."

My friend and I sat for over 10 minutes before we realized they didn&#39;t even come take our orders. They are very inattentive and after bringing our food, never bothered to come refill our waters, teas or side dishes until we flagged them down. It wasn&#39;t even a full house so I don&#39;t understand how they can be so busy. 

I ordered the sea food tofu soup with spam. It comes with purple rice which was delicious with the soup. The side dishes were pretty standard like fish cake, kimchi, pickles but I think they could use more variety. Example being seoul bbq which gives 14 side dishes. I was pretty happy with the food just not the service. They should step up their service since there might be competition in the future and that will be the distinguishing factor of whether people come here or not."

They give you complimentary hot tea and they have little side dishes that come with your meal too for the whole table to share.

I came by Tofu House with my husband this past Sunday around 7 pm. When we walked in, no one acknowledged us. We were waiting for about 6-7 minutes before this one lady acknowledged us. She told us that we can sit at this back table when it is cleaned. Eventually the table got cleaned and we finally sat down 10 minutes later.

After we sat, no one brought us menus. I just told my husband that we just have to patience since there seem to only be 2 servers and one person cleaning tables. Eventually my husband got up and grabbed menus for us. I had a bad feeling and should have walked out when my husband suggested but decided to stay since he was pretty hungry. 

Anyways, after we waited another 5-6 minutes to order, we got:

Wok Vege Ddukbaeki, $11.95 prior to tax- This dish came with a complementary soup that the server said was a miso soup. But it didn&#39;t take like miso but was just okay. The dish itself was good, but wished it was served in a stone pot so that the rice would be crunchy. The portion size is plenty for 2 people (I took home leftovers). 

Mixed Tofu Dinner, $10.00 prior to tax- This dish came with a yellow fish, which my husband liked. But it was pretty standard in taste to other Korean restaurants that we had dined at. This dish itself was okay, again very standard in taste. Nothing remarkable and portion size is good for 2 people. It was nice that you have the choice of choosing white or purple rice with this entree. My husband opted for purple rice, which was cooked well. 

The banchan we got was weak, wished there were a few more choices. But I did like the noodles and tofu. 
------------------
(Total= $ 24.84 after tax, prior to tip)

Service was extremely lacking. The two female employees on the floor apologized a few times saying &#39;sorry, sorry&#39; but that didn&#39;t get them to be more attentive. In general, I didn&#39;t think they were attentive to other restaurant patrons at all except one table. However, I believe this one table is either friends or family members of one of the servers, thus the better service. 

No one refilled our waters. We had to get an employee&#39;s attention (but most of the time they were hiding in the kitchen). There were some tables that needed cleaning and dishes clearing. The girl who was supposed to clean the tables only came out once in a while. 

When we were ready to leave, we just walked up to the register and waited until an employee came out so that we could pay and go. 

The food was just average. I find it surprising that the overall review of this business (at the time of this review and when I looked it up on my Yelp app) is 4.5 stars (of 38 reviews). I have definitely had MUCH BETTER back at home in Los Angeles. A place like this may be okay for the standards of this area, but it is a major fail in my book and would not ever come back.

Oh and expect to smell like the restaurant upon leaving. If you have long hair, tied it back. But why would you still want to come here after reading this review?"

The food is always delicious, especially the Hot Tofu Soups! My favorite is between the Spam Tofu or Noodle Tofu. The customer service has always been amazing and they have always taken good care of us. Most tables seat 4 or more and this place is great for both friends and family! Another great thing is that the owners are always so nice and friendly which makes the experience even better!"

I would recommend ordering a combo and agree on a meat with a friend. The soup is spicy,  it not too intense. I had the stir fried pork belly and it was to die for. I will be back again to try more delicious food. The Kimchi and other sides that come out with the food are also quite delicious!"

I got the white tofu mushroom soup, which was actually pretty good (considering they were restricted to very few ingredients to make it vegetarian friendly). I just added some radish kimchi to make it spicier.

Every tofu soup comes with rice and rice porridge (which they leave covered during your meal in a stone bowl). 

Slow service? It&#39;s okay if you have to wave down your servers. Sometimes that&#39;s the only way you&#39;ll get up and out of there within a limited timeframe. Tell them what you want (multiple times because they might forget) and they&#39;ll get it for you."

I was a little hesitant to go after viewing the menu.  While I enjoy Korean food, the menu can be a bit intimidating because it is not very descriptive.  I followed the direction of my brother and am certainly glad I did.  I ordered the spicy soup with pork dumplings.  The broth is packed with flavor and while it has a good kick, it is not too spicy.  Each soup is made from the same base so they all contain seafood, which I am not a fan of, but this did not bother me.  The oysters and clams were easy to divvy up to my less picky family members and did not leave a fishy aftertaste in the broth.  The food came quickly and was exceptional. 

The prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food you get.  Each meal comes with a variety of unlimited sides to share with the table.  The soups are quite large and come out boiling hot.  They are served with rice and a nice portion of fried fish.  The entrees looked delicious as well.  We shared a couple of meats and they were quite flavorful.  The servers were polite and helpful.   They frequently visited the table to refill drinks and check in on us.  Tofu House is nicely decorated and has room for regular Korean food or tables for Korean BBQ.  Great food, great service, great experience."

I frequent many tofu houses in the bay area and I would say this place is on par with them. I loved this place because it is clean, spacious and the tofu soup is very yummy. I enjoyed the wooden lids that came with the stone soup bowl and the fried fish that came on the side. You get black rice here (or some would call it purple-Heukmi chapssal) which is not only visually appealing but is supposed to be really good for you (like a brown rice). I had the tofu soup combo with spicy pork. I&#39;d recommend getting the combo dish if you enjoy more meat (the tofu dish itself doesn&#39;t come with much if you order a meat 1). The banchan (side dishes) that come with the tofu soup are great and are, of course, refillable with no extra charge. They play a bunch of K-pop music videos on the TVs inside to keep you entertained. I&#39;m looking forward to coming back and trying more dishes."

I&#39;ve tried kimchi a couple times and have never liked it, and while I think the quality of the food I tried at Tofu House was good, I just didn&#39;t care for it.

That being said, the real issue here was the service.  From what I could tell, I was the only non-Korean and English speaker there, and there was a significant language barrier with my server.  That&#39;s not a deal breaker for me, but serving me spicy food and not refilling my water kinda is.  Especially when I have to wave someone down to get said refill.  And when I say &#34;wave someone down&#34;, I mean someone in the kitchen since the servers didn&#39;t spend much time in the dining area.

I ordered the house tofu soup combo with marinated beef strips.  I was happily surprise by all the bonus side dishes that came with the meal, though there was no explanation as to what I was being served.  I loved the silky texture of the soft Tofu but the broth was too strongly spiced - not too hot, just too much seasoning.  The beef had the same issue - the flavor was just too much for me.

After my meal I waited for my check for about ten minutes but the servers were nowhere to be seen, so I went up to the cash register and had the lady there bring out my bill.  

Overall, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back to Tofu Hut.  While part of that is that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got the taste buds for Korean food, the bigger issue here was that the service needs some serious stepping up."

I love Korean food and have eaten it in LA, NYC and every where in between and this place was great!  My husband, 1 year old and I were in the area and decided to give it a try. We ordered the beef combo meal for 2 as well as the veggie dish. We loved the purple rice and so did baby!  They even brought out a dish and spoon especially for her (extra points for being so awesome to baby!)  The soup was spicy and delicious not overpowering on the palate.

I&#39;ve been missing BCD since I left LA and I got super excited that there&#39;s finally something like it here in Colorado. The restaurant is super clean and when we went, they were playing some Korean singing TV shows which was entertaining to say the least. The service was great - prompt and friendly. And the food!!! I ordered the spam soondooboo and my friend ordered this special bean soondooboo. The soup comes with a hot stone bowl that has purple rice in it (let it get crispy!) and a fried fish filet (I believe it&#39;s catfish but I could be wrong). They also give you a small assortment of side dishes.

The tofu was super silky and delicious - dare I say better quality than anything I&#39;ve had in LA. The only disappointment was that it didn&#39;t come with a raw egg. Traditionally, soondooboo alwayssss has a raw egg. Maybe next time I&#39;ll ask for one.

I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

I recommend getting the combo that comes with the 1962 soup and a choice of any of the 4 other dishes you can get such as the spare ribs or bulgogi. I got the soup with the spare ribs and that was a perfect meal. It also came with other side dishes like kimchi, fish cakes, fish, etc. I also loved their purple rice; healthy and good. I would definitely come here often. The soup was spicy but so good so I just couldn&#39;t stop eating it."

I do t get to eat this often because where I live doesn&#39;t have any Korean restaurants. The galbee and side dishes were good so was the soup. It would&#39;ve been better too if service was more attentive. I probably won&#39;t be coming back. I miss California original tofu house it&#39;s so good!!

Just like any Korean restaurant, the entrees come with a number of delicious sides, including fried fish filet, kimchi, and pickled radish. The dishes you have to try are the traditional soft tofu soups, which all come in a spicy red broth. The broth stays the same but the ingredients in the soup change with each dish, giving you a bit of variety without losing that traditional flavor. 

The table bbq is also great. These are a bit pricey but offer more flavors and textures throughout the meal. If you are going out for date night, or go with a friend, and you&#39;re hungry--I recommend getting the combinations for 2--which includes a meat and a soup for two to share. 

It can be a bit difficult to flag down the servers when it&#39;s busy, but overall I&#39;ve always had my expectations for exceeded. If you love spicy or Korean food, Tofu House is a go-to spot!"

It&#39;s 18.7 miles from my house to the Tofu House - that&#39;s 37.4 miles round trip (yes, I am a mathematical wizard). I will avoid the trek on a week night during rush hour, but will happily make it again and again any other time. There are lots of Korean restaurants in this part of Denver, and Tofu House is one of the best. It&#39;s bright and pleasant and very casual and unassuming both inside and out. Other Yelpers have reported that the service can be kind of spotty - ours was gracious and pleasant, and acceptable overall, but faded somewhat toward the end of our meal. We were there on a Saturday night and as the restaurant got busier, our servers tended to get preoccupied with other tables and lose touch with us. We were winding down with our meal so it wasn&#39;t a huge deal, but it was the one relative downside to an otherwise wonderful experience. 

The food at Tofu House is terrific. Some tables are set up for Korean BBQ and others for regular dining. &#34;Korean soup&#34; to me - &#34;Soft Tofu Stew&#34; to the proprietors appears to be a specialty of the house. We had the Seafood Tofu Stew - oyster, clam, mussel, shrimp and squid in a spicy, peppery broth. It is served with rice in a hot stone pot, a piece of fried fish, and of course, Banchan - kimchi, cucumbers, rice noodles and bamboo, the night we went. All for $9.99. For an additional $5.00 - $8.00, it comes as a &#34;1962 Combo Set&#34; with your choice of a large plate of marinated sliced beef, short ribs or spicy pork. So here&#39;s what you do for two - order one Soft Tofu Stew and one 1962 Combo Set, and share the plate of protein - there&#39;s definitely plenty for two. Other menu options include Korean BBQ, Hot Pot Stews and some traditional dishes like Bulgogi. We also had the Bulgogi, and it too was delicious. 

But, you ask, is it authentic Korean? I answer in three ways: 1) beats the heck out of me; 2) everyone at our table thought everything was delicious; and 3) almost everyone else in the restaurant appeared more capable of discerning its authenticity than me, and by all outward appearances, they seemed pretty happy."

The staff was attentive and courteous, though. We ordered the 1962 tofu soup and the kimchi soup, both extra spicy. The soups came out with all but a few pieces of seafood and a few chunks of tofu. The ironic thing was that there was a huge poster plastered on the wall facing me, displaying the 1962 tofu soup with green onions, tofu, seafood, egg etc. When our soup came out, it wasn&#39;t even bubbling anymore, the soup was missing the egg and it just looked like a big bowl of red hot paste (tasted like so). The side dishes are sad compared to the ones in Atlanta--I think there&#39;s only 4 plates of similar-tasting pickled vegetables. There&#39;s fried fish offered at a lot of tofu houses, so that aspect didn&#39;t even make this place. Plus, this fried fish had a really pungent smell, which either meant that the fish wasn&#39;t fresh or the oil was dirty. 

The cherry on top was the fact that when we left, my husband and I both had massive diarrhea for the night that continued into the next day (my apologies for the gross image). That has never, ever happened at any tofu house we&#39;ve ever dined at. If this place is the best of Aurora/Denver, then Atlantans beware. Make your own at home."

The bugolgi was nothing spectacular-you could find the same thing at ten other kbbq spots. What really made this place shine was the tofu soup. I love eating spicy food, and the soup really satisfied that. Overall, great soup but mediocre kbbq and service."

One of the most flavorful meals I&#39;ve had in Denver.  Unpretentious, no frills, delicious food.  I went with the pork and kimchi stew (extra hot of course).  

It arrived boiling hot, and it was exactly what I hoped for when ordering it.  Accompanied by 4 banchan sides, it was a great meal start to finish.

The service was exceptional, warm, and welcoming.  I was made to feel at home, and the food took me back to Chicago where I would try to experience Korea town as often as possible.

But what I do know is that as soon as I started eating I had a warm glow of delicious that washed over me not entirely from the spices. 

The hubs and I dine with an international food group and we&#39;ve had some really awesome meals together. This was among my favorite. 

There aren&#39;t really appetizers per say but the sides come out pretty quickly after being ordered. Apparently different sides are made according to the family or restaurant. We got cold glass noodles with a sesame oil (my favorite), kimchi, spicy calamari, pickled radish and fish cake. Fish cake has never really struck a chord with me but this one was decent. 

The hubs and I did the two person combo of the original 1962 soft tofu soup and mixed grill of calamari and pork. We also got fried fish and sticky rice. The waitress grabbed my husband&#39;s food and started putting it together. Fried fish topped with the mixed grill, rice and then some soup. I love it when that happens!

The soup was incredible. The tofu melted in your mouth and the broth was the absolute perfect amount of heat. I couldn&#39;t get over how good this was. When it is negative 10 degrees outside I know exactly where I&#39;m heading. 

The mixed grill was good but a lot more onions than protein which was a bummer because the protein was really good. 

No dessert either but we were stuffed. I appreciate a menu that is basic and straight forward. The waitress was really sweet and our tab was $25 before tip."

Prior to Saturday November 8th 2014, I came to this restaurant and talk to the Chef and Owner, Steven Woo and their staffs with regards bringing a BIG Group, through our Meetup.  When I arrived on that actual Saturday, everything is being set up on the LEFT WING of this establishment.  I came in early as usual at 17:00hrs.

From there, my friends came at 17:30hrs for Dinner and order away...  Our Staffs answered some questions with regards to the Menu and even show how to mix all the food stuffs when the Main Entrée arrived...

From the simple small banchan that everyone shared, though everyone have their own Sesame Glass Noodle, I think the big favorites are the TOFU Stew or TOFU Soup itself.  Some order with Pork Belly, majority opt with PORK, some just with Tofu and Mushroom.  Heard from a couple of my friends, the Tofu are so SILKY, MELT IN THE MOUTH MOMENTS OH MY!

From what I could recall these are what my friends ordered that evening :

*  COMBO Menu, Pork and Squid
*  COMBO Menu, Beef Short Ribs with Seafood Tofu
*  COMBO Menu, Beef Short Ribs, PORK Belly and Tofu Stew
*  Pork and Squid BBQ Plate
*  Tofu Stew
*  Pork Filled Dumplings and Tofu

Since the weather was a little too hot for me, once again...  I opt to have their BBQ Plate.  This time around I opt to have the Squid Jikhwa ($16.99), aka Squid and Mixed Vege BBQ Plate, in which I ask for EXTRA EXTRA SPICY but boy am I a little disappointed coz this Dish is NOT AS SPICY as I was hoping for.  *SIGH*  Another disappointment was it was filled with MORE SLICES OF ONIONS, aka OVERLOADED WITH ONIONS...

YES, your Main Entrée comes with a bowl of Rice and Cabbage Miso Soup.  YES, they can offer more of the same Banchan if you finished yours etc...

From my other observations, for those who opt for the COMBO Menu, unfortunately, the Main Entrée comes with Fried Fillet instead of the Fried Whole Small Fish.  *SIGH*  Hmmm, I wonder and ponder why the differences..  Maybe due to the Supply and Demand??  Maybe the Norm Palate, aka the Americans, cannot consume or eat WHOLE SMALL FISH??

Its more like 3 stars for the Squid BBQ PLATE...  But for this visit, they have 4 stars in my books, coz, for one, all my friends are happy with what they order and had that evening.  As long as my friends are happy, I am happy for them.  The service can be a hit or miss due to the fact, many other patrons are there when we are there.. so it takes awhile for your main entrée to be ready.  Hence, do have extra patience if they are swamped during PEAK HOURS.

I would definitely return when its BITTERLY COLD Outside to order that SEAFOOD STEW as my next mission!  Thank you Tofu House... Thank you.. See you soon!

We wish Sogongdong Tofu House well in their Business Undertakings.  Since their opening in June 2014, I hope they can do well especially in Aurora&#39;s KOREATOWN, many more years to come!

This place seems rather unassuming, but buried in a strip mall, lies one of Denver&#39;s most promising additions to the restaurant scene this year.   This place is about as authentic as it gets.  Vegan/vegetarians only have three options, but really worth it.  The menu is difficult to decipher, as little is in English, and you will feel skeptical at first, but stick with it.  The food is simply fantastic.  No bones about it, served in a traditional Korean manner with multiple small plates and then entrees in blazing hot pots, this is not one to miss.  I wish I could spell what I had, but it was fantastic.  Don&#39;t skip this place if you are nearby."

I also enjoy the tofu soup and the purple rice that they serve it with, Perfect lunch or dinner."

I&#39;m a huge fan of soup and Korean food - as far as I know this is the only Tofu House in Aurora, CO. The soup selection is vast with decent prices! They serve your soup and it comes with rice in the hot stone bowl with about 5 side dishes. I&#39;m used to getting more side dishes, but with the affordable price of the soup and everything it all kind of balances out.

The ambiance is casual, clean. I would revisit."

Had some difficulty locating it.  This business is on the west side of Havana and Iliff, and actually faces Iliff (it took us a while to find it), we were expecting it to face Havana.  It was really busy for being new.

Decor: clean, contemporary, hip, spacious

Service:  good, however only 2 servers... think they need to hire more help.  I&#39;m was worried that servers were annoyed with us because we aren&#39;t Korean and don&#39;t know how to order right, but they helped us and were very friendly.

Food:  very good, between 7 people we did an A (1 person)combo (kalbi and soup), a C combo (for 2 people) (fish, pork, squid and soup), and a D combo (for 2 people) (fish, spicy pork, soup).  We had plenty to eat with good variety.  Our total was $67... not bad for Korean food around here.  

The soup that comes in the combo is small and is basic (just tofu), however the broth is really good.  If you want more &#34;stuff&#34; in your broth like seafood, you probably have to order it separately.  For the soup I would say 5 star, kalbi was a 4 star, a little too fatty for my tasty, but the flavor was good, I was disappointed with the bulgogi... a little dry, overcooked - 3 star.  The rice for the A combo is in the clay pot (which I love!).  The spicy pork is pretty good - 4 star.  

Drink menu - sodas only at this time and not listed on the menu... I think they may be waiting for licensing for alcoholic drinks.

Overall a very good experience.  I will definitely return."

Tofu Soup is delicious. Seolleongtang is delicious. Prices are reasonable, considering it&#39;s pretty much the only place you can get good tofu soup here in town. Yes, you can get tofu soup at Korean restaurants, and Korean BBQ joints, but this place is pretty authentically delicious. 

As I always say, the best places to get authentic ethnic food are the places where you need to fumble through that ethnicity&#39;s language to get the good stuff (or hope to God they have picture menus and point!!)

Then the owner comes out and apologized and gave us 50% off the bill. Was so mad at the poor service that I did not leave a tip. Felt bad about it now but this incident left a bad impression and I don&#39;t think I will be coming back. Waitress said thank you and  glared at me on the way out according to my brother.

1. Restaurants with under 100 4 star  reviews are just as good as restaurants with over 100 reviews.
2. Racism may have played a factor in one of the negative  reviews.

I hate to say it but it was really the second reason that made me want to eat here lol. Needless  to say, I proved both points two my friends. The food here is incredible I ordered mushroom tofu soup at the suggestion  of the veteran server and I ate like a king. 

My little $9 meal came with almost more food than I can eat. I am a 6&#39;9&#34;man with the heart of a fat kid so filling  me to my limit is no small feat. Each tofu soup meal comes with a pot of soup (notice I didn&#39;t  say cup), a pot of rice, a bowl of noodles, a serving plate of pickled/spiced veggies, a serving plate of homemade kimichi, and would I wager is 4 Oz of fried fish (You may get more fish depending on how it is cut) You couldn&#39;t get a more balanced meal than this one. Beyond being balance and filling I can attest that everything is cooked to perfection. The fish was lightly fried so you got a flaky crust and the tender, juicy awesomeness of the fish.

 I recommend going to Tofu house on a rainy day or any day that you feel that you need your spirits lifted. That is what this food will do for you."

Upon entering the restaurant I was a little concerned because there were only two other diners there. I never like to see a restaurant, especially a new independent restaurant nearly empty. Fortunately, many other tables filled in, so hopefully this place will have every opportunity to really earn a spot in Denver&#39;s crowded culinary world. 

While I&#39;ve never traveled in Korea, and am far from an expert on such things, I am a big fan of Korean cuisine. I&#39;ve been to a number of Korean restaurants in town, and had a lot of homemade Korean meals, and this might just be my new favourite Korean restaurant. Everything about my meal tonight was as it should be. When one walks into Tofu House the ambiance immediately presents itself. Behind the bar there is a large tv (tonight playing some kind of K-Pop version of a singing/dancing/talent show). The walls, at least on half of the restaurant, are lined with row after row of Chinese writing (I&#39;m guessing this was left over from a previous establishment, but even with the culture mixing it well sets the mood for a delicious Korean meal). The room is very clean, modern, and the Korean advertisements on the wall add a bit of fun. 

Tofu House specializes in a spicy soup filled with delicious soft tofu and a variety of other possibilities depending on your order. However, for the less adventurous or more carnivorous there are a variety of Korean BBQ options as well. I had been waiting to try Tofu House until a particularly cold night because it seemed like the ideal time for a spicy Korean soup. Boy was I right. The soup warmed me up from the inside out. And, of course, before the soup came out we were treated to a selection of delicious banchan (which are basically small plate type apps). I&#39;m a kimchi fiend, and this is among the best I&#39;ve had in a restaurant (which, sadly, are all infinitely better than any kind of jarred kimchi I&#39;ve ever come across, but also never quite match up to the homemade varieties that I&#39;ve been treated to). The banchan were pretty standard, but all quite tasty. 

Everything about dinner tonight was as good as I could have hoped for. I&#39;m not even joking when I say that, given the opportunity, I would gladly go back to Tofu House tomorrow."

We were the first ones here so the place was empty. Brought my 5 year old kid with me so I had to order something for his taste as well. 

We went wit combo B. The 1962 soon dubu and spicy pork belly. Banchan was limited but came out immediately. It was good. 
Their kimchi is pretty darn good!!! Prob one of the best in Denver. 
Soon dubu was tasty. Not as thick and greasy as seoul bbq and full of flavor. The spicy pork belly had just enough spice and sweetness that my kid could tolerate. 

The rice came in a stone pot so you could add your tea too as well. 
Overall, meal was great. Will def be coming back."

We got banchan or side dishes, &#34;purple rice,&#34; and fried fish which we could have with bones or without bones. I tried some of the bulgogi/BBQ and it was good. The only thing I would dock points for is that in comparison to other Korean restaurants in my experience, Tofu house doesn&#39;t offer nearly as much side dishes. But regardless the portions are pretty fulfilling, so can&#39;t complain too much when I&#39;m rolling around from being so full."

We also had an order of the crispy garlic tofu and an entree of a BBQ item which I can&#39;t remember the name of. Wow.. everything was so delicious! The tofu soup had a touch of heat and the tofu was like silk in the savory broth. The crispy garlic tofu was lightly fried with a crisp outer crust and the tofu inside was soft and buttery. The rice pot had perfect sticky rice which also came with a crispy catfish and side of mung beans in a vinegary sauce. Everything was perfectly prepared and well seasoned. I haven&#39;t been this stuffed in quite some time.. I couldn&#39;t stop eating. One item of note, there was a bit of a language barrier.

I was really excited to try it after craving it from my trip in LA (yum). However, ALL of the tofu soup dishes have seafood in them (specifically clam). I would think that there would be at least one dish with maybe just meat? They did have one vegetarian tofu soup which is only tofu and mushrooms (different types of mushrooms). It&#39;s also the only one on the menu that isn&#39;t spicy if you&#39;re not looking for spicy. I asked for it to be spicy though and they said that they could not do that which really surprised me and made me wonder how they make the dish if you can&#39;t make it spicy? I would imagine making this dish spicy would be a relatively easy change? That&#39;s the one thing that really knocked this place down a bit.

The soup was really good. It came with a good amount of rice and tofu and the tofu was quite delicious. The dish also comes with fried fish and some side dishes of course. They also give you barley tea at the beginning. You can ask for it hot or cold. I would recommend cold if you&#39;re getting the soup just because if you have hot soup, you&#39;ll probably want some cool water to cool your self. Both are delicious though. We also ordered the dumplings and the fried tofu. The fried tofu was interesting. It had a nice fried shell with some pretty good seasoning on it and the inside was quite soft, the same as in the soup. The fried dumplings were good too though I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s not really their specialty. 

Service was okay. They weren&#39;t super attentive but I really didn&#39;t mind at all. They came when you asked or when you seemed like you needed something and they were quite nice. 

The place was nice, spacious, and clean. They had a few tables that were set up for KBBQ but most of the tables I saw were just normal."

I went the week that it opened and I don&#39;t ever think I&#39;ll be going back. 


Pros: 
-.....fast service? But there were only 2 other tables there so... 
-they gave us a sample of another dish because it was opening week for free. 


Cons: 
-Tofu soup was tasteless, not spicy, and smelled odd...almost like raw fish from the fish market. I know this is a weird explanation.. -_- 
-The soup came out a little warm. Tofu soup should be sizzling hot when it comes out, that&#39;s a part of the experience, but this soup was warm. 
-No egg to drop into the soup. I understand that sogongdong doesn&#39;t provide eggs for their soups, but if they don&#39;t provide the egg to make their soups more flavorful, the soup itself should have been good...but NOPE. 
-Service...was eh....I felt bad for one of the girl workers who was constantly being talked down to by the older waitress. I understand you need to train her, but can you do it away from the customers, please?

Needless to say...I was disappointed."

I can understand some of the slow start; Korean food is a bit intimidating, with fiery red soybean paste and chiles spicing nearly everything, it can be overpowering to the American palate.  And Korean restaurants have Korean menus and servers that are not the most welcoming to english speakers.  Add on top of that the fact that Korean restaurants require a drive to Aurora, and you&#39;re really asking alot of the Denver dining public.    So a place like Tofu House requires a little courage and adventurousness to walk through its doors.   But for those who do they are richly rewarded.  Tofu House has the most delicious dobu jigae (tofu stew) in town.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the soybean paste that they use or the recipe that they get from the home office (Tofu house is a branch-franchise of a well-known Seoul-based restaurant) but the stew base is has a bright, savory taste that cuts through the redhot spiciness.  The soft tofu floats in the iron bowls like little white pillows on a roiling red sea.     You know almost immediately why Tofu House is so famous for their dobu jigae.    If you have any question about how to order the tobu jigae, it&#39;s pretty easy. They are all listed on the second page of the menu, and you just choose what kind of meat or seafood you want added.  Pork and seafood is pretty standard, but vegetarian and beef are also offered.  They serve it with a traditional heated stone bowl of rice, which I  love because you get crispy bits of rice to scrape from the sides of the bowl.    For the less adventurous, one can order the grilled meats as most Korean restaurants offer, but be aware that Tofu House does not have table top grills so they cook it in the back.  

Service is very nice; I think the branch is locally owned so you get some personal attention from someone who has a stake in the venture.  I have not been there when it was busy, so I can&#39;t speak to some people&#39;s experience about being understaffed.  They are friendly, speak english well and are happy to answer questions you may have about the menu.   Tofu House is a step above the usual Korean restaurant experience, and we should be glad to have a branch here in Denver."

The Banshans were very fresh and I especially liked the Kimchi and sesame Zuchini.  The seafood Tofu arrived boiling hot, which is how it should be.

Yes, that is what the Tofu House specializes in.  Simply put this is Korea&#39;s hot and spicy tofu stew.  Instead of wrapping your head around what this would be like, what is important is that this is comfort food much like a bowl of chili for the southwest  or maybe like a bowl of curry from India.  But Sundubu Jjigae is totally its own thing.  Soft tofu and hot red pepper mixed with a cacophony of vegetables and meats or fish of your choosing served piping hot in a stone bowl.  I can almost visualize a Korean winter while eating it.  Surprisingly, I did not see a lot vegan options for a place that is called the Tofu house.  
Like all Korean restaurants in Aurora, your just going to have to get past the language barrier and the awkwardness that comes with the differing expectations of customer service and go for the adventure.  Tofu house is very elegantly decorated and has a zen feel to the clean yet simple design.  I&#39;m sure there are other places to get Sundubu but this place really captures a great experience as well."

Everything tasted delicious.  And it was a silly amount of food for the price we paid.  Like, so much food.  I&#39;d steer clear of the eel next time, but I think that&#39;s just a person preference (texture).  Nothing they&#39;re doing wrong.  The atmosphere is great, too.  It looks recently remodeled.  Great wood work and nice eating area.  It cracks me up that they have to use wheeled carts to transport the huge amounts of boiling hot food to each table."

Panzano = Great service, comfy and intimate restaurant serving delicious Italian food.
Our server was super awesome, great details on dishes and recommendations for wine as well.  The smoked trout app was delicious.  
We ordered both &#39;specials&#39; that night.  I got the braised lamb pasta, absolutely delicious.  The pasta is made from farro flour so it has a great bite to it.  Perfect with the lamb! 
My GF got the steak special, cooked perfectly with delicious cauliflower and potatoes.  
You can see that the quality and perfection of each dish as it comes out.

Only reason why it&#39;s 4 instead of 5 stars, is that they were up selling fresh shaved truffles on any meal if you want. One at $7 and one at $12. We asked for the truffle addition to ours and what a let down!! There was absolutely NO FLAVOR AT ALL!! 
The waiter tried to tell us that he and the chef believe because of our meals being &#34;strong in flavor&#34; that&#39;s why we couldn&#39;t taste them. We have been on truffle tastings before. Black and white truffles both. We know what they should taste like. We actually took the shaving off our plate to try it alone just to make sure, and again ZERO flavor. Tasted dried out and like it lost its umph days ago. Such a let down for a great upsale! Better luck next time!"

First of all, this happy hour is 7 days a week! You can come on Saturdays and Sundays. I came on a Saturday at 5:40 pm, perfect time for dinner and they let me order drinks right up until 5:59 pm to get the happy hour pricing. 

They have a vast range of food or drinks depending on your price range. Small plate offerings that are either $5, $6, or $7. The drinks range anywhere from $4 to $12 carafes of wine!

I got the Pastiche- so dense that a small plate of it was filling enough- I couldn&#39;t eat anything else! It came with hearty spicy meatballs and cheese tortellini all baked in a ragu sauce that had hints of cinnamon in every bite. It was a delight to eat and incredibly flavorful. 

I washed it down with a blackberry gin cocktail- boy they make them strong!

In the heart of downtown, you can&#39;t go wrong with this place. Would be perfect to go to before a late night show at the DCPA."

I think it is one of the best food happy hours in Denver. You get small servings of some of their incredible food at cheaper prices (the plates are either $5, $6, $7, or $8 and there are many to choose from in each category). Some of my favs are the calamari fritti, pastiche (meatballs and cheese tortellini baked with ragú and spiced custard, and a savory thyme crust), and the cavolini di bruxelles (fried brussels sprouts, apple cider reduction, pistachios, rosemary salt, sliced green apple). Each is $6 and are delicious! The crepe is also amazing when they have it. 

They also have delicious $6 cocktails. You can sit inside or sit out on the patio. I&#39;ve never had to wait to get a seat for happy hour.

The happy hour is daily 2:30pm until 6:00pm. It is nice to be able to go on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon."

My fiance IS italian, I think you know where he stands. So, as a rule, we don&#39;t eat these items anywhere but the tri-state area. You know, places that can actually make these types of foods, and properly. 

We were meeting up with my fiance&#39;s cousin and his wife for dinner and they suggested Panzano. A quick search told me it was italian, so I was skeptical. However, since my fiance&#39;s cousin is also italian and originally from the tri-state area, I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d steer us wrong... and they didn&#39;t!

As our flight had been delayed, we were a little late to dinner, but my fiance&#39;s cousin and his wife were enjoying cocktails at the bar. We were seated and our server came over. Our server was not only super knowledgeable about the menu, but also super on top of his game when it came to food restrictions. A quick mention and he was able to direct us to certain dishes, or have the dishes amended. When he brought out the fresh baked bread, he mentioned that the sauce had anchovies, so additionally he brought out oil and vinegar as well (butter would have been nice too, but whatever). 

My fiance&#39;s cousin&#39;s wife (I know, that&#39;s a mouthful) and I shared the appetizer of the mushroom cremes. SO good. That sauce!!! My fiance and his cousin shared the calamari. For dinner, my fiance had the Carbonara. Not sure what, his cousin&#39;s wife had the beef, his cousin had the scallops and I had a special. Mushroom ravioli. Fresh housemade  pasta. Amazing.

Like my last review, this is just about happy hour, though I&#39;ve been here for one or two less-than-memorable dinners. They have completely changed their HH cocktail list, and I hate it! You might like it, but it no longer has anything I find worth drinking on it- on principal of not liking anything on their HH menu, I ordered club soda...what?!?! And the prices have gone up a bit.

The HH food is about the same but I really came here for their specialty cocktails on HH, but probably no more. I am so sad. 

So, if you&#39;re coming here based on previous HH reviews, I encourage you to preview their menu to ensure it&#39;ll have something to your liking before you come."

3 stars for the dish I got- Salmon entree with white beans. The salmon was nicely pan fried on one side but it was very well done and the server told me it would be cooked medium.  Also, the beans had a hard texture like it was undercooked.  I would not get this next time.
5 stars for the Brussels sprouts appetizer! Was so yummy. 
In addition, my gf got the eggplant parm type of dish and really enjoyed it.  Also, heard the Cesar salad was yummy. 

I wouldn&#39;t necessarily come back to this restaurant if I were in the neighborhood again unless I was craving the Brussels sprouts!"

Honestly, I came here twice during restaurant week and will definitely be back for happy hour just because of those Brussels sprouts. 

When I first came here during restaurant week, one of my girlfriends suggested the Brussels sprouts (cavolini Di Bruxelles) as an appetizer because I was leaning towards their calamari. I am so glad I listened to her because those Brussels sprouts did not disappoint! They were soaked in olive oil and very crispy with pistachios and slices of Apple crisps. I thought it&#39;d be too much but I finished the whole entire plate. Seriously I have dreams about those Brussels sprouts!

Ok ok, moving on from the Brussels sprouts. For my second course, I got the tomato soup (o di giorno). I&#39;m not a huge fan of tomato soup because it&#39;s usually too tomato-y like ketchup; however, this soup was perfectly portioned and flavored. It had smoked mozzarella along with tomato and basil oil. 

My third course meal, I had tried three different entrees since I came here with my girlfriends the first time and my fiancée the second time. I had their pastiche, vitello osso bucco, and pollo al Marsala. All three courses did not disappoint and were absolutely appetizing! The pastiche was my favorite, it is meatballs and cheese tortellini baked with ragu and cinnamon custard. The cinnamon gave the tortellini a nice sweet taste but not too overpowering. The vitello osso bucco is veal with Gorgonzola and lemon gremolata. This was my least favorite but the veal fell right off the bone and was very tender. The pollo al Marsala is chicken with Marsala wine, truffle mushroom, risotto and fried prosciutto. The fried prosciutto I thought didn&#39;t go with the chicken but overall the chicken was seasoned perfectly. 

The last course was the dessert and I tried all three options of tiramisu, nocciola torta, and budino di caramello. Oh my goodness, I loved every single spoonful. The tiramisu was my favorite! I&#39;m not a big fan of tiramisu but this was an authentic slice that the rum wasn&#39;t too overpowering and each bite just melted in my mouth. The budino di caramello is butterscotch pudding that I loved dipping the Rosemary pine nut cookie in it. Lastly, the nocciola torta is chocolate hazelnut tarts with frangelico cranberries and these were little bites hazelnutty goodness. 

My mouth is just drooling over this recap of panzano. If you are in the market for real authentic Italian cuisine, panzano is a must! I cannot wait to be back for more especially their Brussels sprouts lol!"

(See HH menu I posted)  Seriously can&#39;t be beat for the money.  

My husband and I tried 4 dishes...gnocchi with pesto, brussel sprouts with apple, pasta with veal ragu, and the pastiche.  All were incredible.

I was flying solo and in desire of a good dinner close to my hotel.  I sat at the bar for my dinner, and the bartender who waited on me was fabulous. When my food took a little longer than he anticipated he gave me a little addition to my &#34;glass&#34; of wine. Though i was in no hurry, so it didn&#39;t bother me. He checked in often, but not too often. And then when i ordered dessert and asked for his opinion on a dessert wine, he poured me a taste of two to help me make my decision. 

Aside from the fabulous service, the food was great! I had the gnocchi, which was perfect. Often gnocchi is served with a heavy sauce that ends up weighing me down. Instead the ragu that was served with it, along with the tomatoes was the perfect balance of flavors. I had the chocolate almond cake which was amazing, paired with a nice amaro. I&#39;m not from Denver, but if i lived here, with the great combination of service, atmosphere and food, I&#39;d definitely come back!"

I came around 5:40 to get a drink before our 6 p.m. reservation and was disappointed to learn that they ended happy hour at 5 instead of 6 during restaurant week. The bar was packed and I had to wait around 15 minutes just to order a glass of Rose. Still, it was really busy at the time so I can&#39;t fault them too much.

Dinner was a 4-course meal of perfectly sized portions. The bread basket and tapenade that came first were delicious and boasted a selection of 4 different breads. I would have happily ate the whole basket on another day, but limited myself since I knew there was a lot of food to come.

I started with the Cavolini di Bruxelles, and I think that was the highlight of the meal. You have never experienced the glory of brussels sprouts until you have tried these. Crispy, flaky, tossed with pistachios, and finished with fresh green apple slices, I could happily eat this every day of my life. The Zuppa di Giorno followed, which was a tomato and smoked mozzarella soup topped with basil oil. So good. 

The Vitello Osso Bucco came next, and while it was good, it paled in comparison to the other courses. The polenta was more grainy than I like and wasn&#39;t very flavorful. My dining companions all ordered the Pastiche, however, and that dish received rave reviews.

For dessert, we all ordered something different so we could try them all. I had the Nocciola Torte which was my favorite. It wasn&#39;t overly sweet, was plated beautifully, and was light enough for me to get through even though I was stuffed to the max. The Tiramisu was excellent and the Budino di Caramello was very decadent. 

This has been my favorite Denver Restaurant Week menu thus far and will definitely be returning for happy hour in the near future!"

We enjoyed amazing drinks, outstanding appetizers, and amazing entrees.  I ordered a Ginger Cherry Lime Aid, the group ordered the Beet Salad and Fried Calamari Appetizers, and I got the Lasagna al Forno as my entrée.  

The drink was VERY Gingery, but refreshing.  The Beets with Goat Cheese were delicious!  The fried Calamari seemed fresher than most I&#39;ve had even right on the coast!  Even the fresh baked Bread and Olive Tepanad they brought to the table were a delight.  

But, the highlight for me was the Lasagna.  Now, I love Lasagna... and they asked if I wanted meat sauce but reccomended I try it without.  I&#39;m so glad I did as this was easily the most delicious lasagna I&#39;ve had on my entire life!  The sauce was bright and fresh, the pasta was tender and cooked to perfection.

We were staying at the Hotel Monaco (terrible experience there unfortunately), and definitely weren&#39;t trying to go far for dinner...when I looked up the reviews for Panzano I was sold immediately (not to mention it was restaurant week!!).

From the moment we sat down we knew it was going to be a great experience. I&#39;m a strong believer that the server sets the tone for the meal and good service beats out good food any day of the week. Our server was amazing. He literally was so knowledgeable, so friendly, and we basically wanted to be friends with him!

Service was efficient and the food was incredible. Standouts were the mushroom crepes (super rich), brussels sprouts, and pasta ragu.

Most of the girls had the Eggs Benedict and they all LOVED it.  Someone ordered a side of sauted spinach that was really good also.  I had the Pastiche.  OMG it was sooo good.  It had a tiny sweetness to it.  I couldn&#39;t stop eating it and neither could the girls that tried &#34;a bite&#34;.

So it&#39;s the perfect name for Elise Wiggins&#39;s wonderfully creative and authentic Italian restaurant housed downtown within the Hotel Monaco. I used to think that the place was a little too chi-chi for me, aimed mainly at business lunches. But how wrong I was. They&#39;ve got a great brunch, one of the best Happy Hours in Denver, and the dinner menu is brilliant in both scope and depth.

My favorite place to sit is at the Chef&#39;s Counter where you can see them working hard to prepare some of the finest food in town. Had their Melanzane Fritte today and the brightness of the rustic tomato sauce worked perfectly with the fresh basil leaves, goat cheese and garnish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar reduction. And that eggplant . . . It was perfectly fried and light as a feather.

Finished with one of the absolutely most delicious Budinos I&#39;ve ever tasted. So if you&#39;re a fan of butterscotch, just think of mixing it with homemade salted caramel and topping it off with whipped cream, a buttery pine nut cookie and a raspberry. What a way to blow your diet. But oh so worth it.

Bottom Line:  Stop in for a great happy hour feast and terrific cocktails.  You won&#39;t be sorry!"

You look on your Yelp app to find somewhere to grab a bite, and find an Italian restaurant called Panzano, across the street from your Airbnb. This is it, you put your coat, scarf, and gloves on and run outside making sure to avoid any black ice patches, and make your way over, having absolutely no expectations.

I was MIND BLOWN. I don&#39;t even prefer Italian food, but to this day, I think about Panzano sometimes. This is a MUST TRY. Every single thing I&#39;ve had here was delicious. In the 1 week I was in Denver, we went a total of 3 times. Then, we went back to Denver 6 months later, AND WE HAD TO COME BACK (and our waiter remembered us and what we ordered on our first night!!). Great HAPPY HOUR deals too! Every day 2:30-6pm.

I DREAM OF PASTICHE. GET IT. YOU WON&#39;T REGRET IT. My bf got it the first time, and I couldn&#39;t stop stealing his. There are other delicious items on the menu, but when we come, we each get our own Pastiche.. &#39;cuz there&#39;s no way I&#39;m sharing mine. This is something I would never gravitate towards on a menu. I don&#39;t like tortellini, I don&#39;t like meatballs, and I surely don&#39;t like &#34;spiced custard&#34; in the description of my entree. The &#34;spiced custard&#34; is only the smallest hint of sweetness which gives the dish a cinnamon-y and even heartier taste (like Thanksgiving).

Other tasty menu items:

PASTICHE PASTICHE PASTICHE (a pot of tasty tortellini in a tomato-ey sauce and meatballs)
MELANZANE FRITTE (fried eggplant)
CAVOLINI DI BRUXELLES (fried brussel sprouts)
SCALLOPINI DI VITELLO (veal)
RAGU DI AGNELLO (lamb ragu with the bombest soft pecorino)
CARBONARA ALLA PANZANO (there&#39;s an egg on top, that&#39;s all I need to say)

Sorry for all the caps, too much excitement for one Yelp review."

We were told to use the hotel valet next door which was in fact a breeze with discount validation (only $8). We got there just before the lunch rush about 11:30 so we were seated immediately. Our server was very informative and helpful as my other half is gluten intolerance. In fact they have a gluten free menu. We ordered the Barbabietole di Rucola (beets and arugula salad) with a delicious lemon ricotta and the Pesce Fresco (salmon dish). Both were fantastic!! I will for sure come back :) 
FYI: by the time we left the restaurant was almost full."

Try the cheese crepe, the toast with truffle honey (OMG salivating writing this), actually just try any selection of the small plates as they are all good.

Sure, it&#39;s been around for awhile -- so it&#39;s not the newest, hippest spot. But I love it. It&#39;s one of those spots you keep coming back to because you feel at home.

HAPPY HOUR: 2:30pm-6pm / 7 days a week
The cocktails ($6) and food ($4-$7) are both absolutely fantastic (and the beer is only $4 and wine $5). The selection of both is huge and you can easily have a full dinner here at happy hour prices.

HH RECOMMENDATIONS:
Cocktail: &#34;R and R&#34; (Grey Goose vodka, raspberry liqueur, muddled raspberries, rosemary, splash of soda
Cocktail: &#34;Cucumber Mint Mule&#34; (Bombay Sapphire gin, lime juice, ginger beer, muddled mint and cucumber
Food: Cavolini di Bruxelles (brussel sprouts with apple cider reduction, pistachios, rosemary salt, and sliced green apple). Despite the lack of bacon, they taste fantastic (I know -- shocker).
Food: Scallopini di Vitello (grass-fed veal scallopini with lemon, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, mashed potatoes, and spinach). It&#39;s rich, delicious, saucy, meaty, and pretty much my go-to every time I&#39;m here.
Food: Capesante (pan-seared scallop, spinach, ricotta gnudi, spring vegetables, basil leek nage, saffron pecorino, fried shallots, and mint). You can&#39;t not love this giant scallop and the sauce.

PRO TIP:
Make sure you get here by 5pm on popular nights, because the entire HH lounge is usually packed by then."

Nevertheless, our server was on point. Cordial, engaging, prompt, and attentive without being obtrusive. Everyone there that evening was gracious. 

We started with the flatbread and found that okay. Truffled something or other that was meh- not quite memorable. 

However, each of our main dishes were very well done from taste to presentation. We had some eggplant lovers and the crisp, thin slices of eggplant were terrific. Another had the tasty veal scallopini recommended by others. My choice was the gnocchi with rabbit confit. Nice, savory dish that was well balanced and left you yearning for more. 

If you leave room for dessert, the tiramisu is terrific."

There is sort of a separate bar/lounge area with I think a different / possibly cheaper menu, but if you want to splurge, I highly recommend the full on dining experience.  Everything my date and I ate was beyond excellent and they had many wine options, including our favorite Montalcino.

Ragu with lamb and homemade pasta and gnocchi with rabbit also great.  Overall, we really enjoyed everything we ate here.  For me, homemade pasta is the key to great Italian...like homemade tortillas for Mexican food...it just sets you apart and into another level.  We were unable to finish our entrees due to being full and I was crestfallen to be honest.  The part I did eat of the ragu was delicious and I really wish I had been able to finish it.  Overall, I would like to go back.  A classy place with great food and the prices to match.  The above was about $105 before tip."

My dinner was, &#34;Pollo al Mars ala&#34; --Chicken scallopini, truffle mushroom risotto, fried prosciutto.... wow--just wow! --and definitely ask the waiter to pair your dinner with a recommended wine!

We finished off the night with &#34;Selezione di Gelati e Sorbetti&#34; -- a trio of delicious sorbets made in house -- perfect to cleanse the palate and call it a night! 

Recommend asking for a seat either at the bar where food is prepared (quite entertaining) or nearby -- excellent views of the entire restaurant.... and if possible, ask to meet Exec Chef Elise Wiggins -- she&#39;s quite incredible, talented, friendly and just a joy -- a gem for Denver!"

I returned late night with husband this past Saturday. We rolled in at around 10:30 pm. Very late for us and rather late for their staff. Nevertheless, the staff was completely professional and awesome.
We started off with a great bottle of wine, suggested by our waiter.
Ragu di Agnello which was AMAZING. The ragu was so rich and delicious. The meat was so tender, and it was just the right amount.
My husband got the Garganelli con Pollo. It looked so unassuming when it arrived but it too was amazing. It was a little spicy and the smoked ricotta gave it such a great flavor.
We got the cannoli for dessert. The filling was really fresh and delicious. While the exterior was good too, I was kind of wanting that thick, fried, exterior. It was still perfect after our rich meals.
This was a rather ridiculously nice, unplanned late night meal, but we enjoyed every minute of it."

The atmosphere is a little old school, but I find it charming and the food was spectacular and priced well.

Upon arriving at 4:30 on a Tuesday, I was directed by the hostess to sit wherever I&#39;d like. The bar was bustling and the mood was cheerful. I was greeted right away by our server, who was helpful and attentive despite a full house.

I love that the menu is so versatile and that you can choose from an array of drinks for $5 and that small plates range from $6-8. A great deal for great food, and 3 plates each was more than enough for my girlfriend and I (We each had some food left). 

I loved everything that I tried! The Brussels Sprouts were light but sweet (in just the right way), the gnocchi balanced out the Brussels by being drenched in butter and truffle oil (still dreaming about these) and the chicken scallopini was moist (it was so good I will use that word even though I hate it) that it practically melted in my mouth!

Also had a great Prosecco for $5 that was wonderfully sweet without being overly so or dry as Proseccos often are. 

Happy Hour at Panzano definitely has left me intrigued and looking forward to returning for a full meal in the near future."

We have dined at endless new, trendy, hip and well rated restaurants (Fruition, Elway&#39;s, Kevin Taylor&#39;s, 1515, etc.) and Panzano is the only restaurant that we continue to dine at. It starts with the extremely personable and down right love-able staff, this includes Lori, Papa and Dimitri. Next comes their house made breads, the Focaccia is what dreams are made of. Paired with the daily soup makes a creamy, sometimes delicately cheesy, delight. It is an absolute must that you start with the Brussel Sprouts. A some what bitter vegetable was no challenge for Chef Elise (who I have asked to meet before lol), who transformed them into a crispier less-starchy and slightly-sweet french fry. Remember when pork and apples were a thing? Well Brussel Sprouts with an apple cider reduction, pistachios and fresh Granny Smith slices are leaps and bounds better and will stick around a lot longer too. Follow this up with the a half order of the above mentioned soup (and if you&#39;re feeling real crazy a half order of the grilled Caesar salad). My fiancé loves the Carbonara. What I must highlight is Panzano&#39;s endless options for those that follow a vegetarian diet. It is one of the few places that I can enjoy all the best they have to offer without special instruction. But, the few times I&#39;ve ventured outside of my unusual they are always exceedingly accommodating to my dietary restrictions. I personally enjoy either the Eggplant or Lasagna! To finish it out we love to share a black Lavazza americano with a piece of Tiramisu (which used to be made with gelatin, but somehow now excludes the non-vegetarian friendly ingredient). All of this comes to about ~$100, but come for their happy hour and enjoy almost all of it for a lot less!

To sum:
Dress up or dress down (I&#39;ve worn a suit or a hoodie)
Ask for Lori, Papa or Dimitri
Try to get a window seat
Get lots of Focaccia
Get the Brussel Sprouts
Repeat"

The spinach salad was okay, fresh leaves, but otherwise fairly uneventful. The Brussel sprouts tasted a bit too fried.
My only real issue was the service.
We had to ask for silverware numerous times, were given bread and butter without a knife. When our entrees came we had to ask for forks for two people in our party. Maybe he had a long day, but he didn&#39;t seem super exited or invested to deal with us during the entirety of our meal.

Its hard to say who was better, the front or the back of the house. The welcoming staff guides you to a well-appointed table where more, equally as welcoming and remarkably knowledgeable service begins. We were fortunate to be attended by D&#39;mitri, a sommelier whose counsel was impeccable. The food did not let the service down. Beginning with the best fried calamari appy I&#39;ve ever had, we progressed to a pleasingly complex arugula  salad with Colorado peaches, grana padano, and finished with the most carefully and weirdly perfect fried eggplant you&#39;ll ever see. The flavors were terrific, the breading golden brown and the slices of eggplant and saucing were great, but everything was so symmetrical,  it was not wrong or bad in any way, just...curious.

I&#39;m a huge fan of Italian and this place had the most positive reviews, so we settled on making a reservation here. The hostess was sweet and accommodated us based on our reservation notes (seat by the window, birthday, etc). Our server was fast and accommodating, but she also gave us plenty of time to relax and look over the menu without rushing our orders. 
We decided to split the flatbread w/prosciutto to start - delicious! Very light, but a great combination of flavors; prosciutto, truffle oil, balsamic, a brie-like cheese and parsley. They all complimented one another. 
We&#39;re both huge pasta fans so we were planning on splitting a pasta but couldn&#39;t make a joint decision; our server offered to bring us half-portions of two! My bf got the carbonara, and I got the lamb ragu. I thought the ragu was excellent; the carbonara came out slightly cold, with an overcooked fried egg; I didn&#39;t love it...
To finish we split the fried eggplant entreé (like a deconstructed eggplant parm); the plating was very pretty, and the eggplant was perfectly cooked. I think the pomodoro sauce lacked flavor, however. 
Since it was my birthday they gave us a complimentary dessert; the creme brulee was delicious! As we were leaving, our server gave me a happy birthday card with a gift of another complimentary dessert next time we went. I think we will return to try different things on the menu."

Panzano has a very respectable cocktail list for $6 a pop...they&#39;re not at a Williams &amp; Graham level, but they&#39;re creative and well made with some exotic ingredients, and can crank them out quickly.  Also have $4 beer if you&#39;re more of a beer person (and be honest, if you live in Denver, you should be).  
Food specials are also rockin&#39; if you&#39;re hungry...and who isn&#39;t ready for a snack at happy hour?  Small plates range from $4 - $7, and most are a good value.  Duck Mousse and Trout Pate were standouts and highly recommended; we didn&#39;t try pizza but they looked good if that&#39;s your thing.  The charcuterie plate however was pretty underwhelming for $7; there are better plays in the city if meat &amp; cheese is your thing.    

We didn&#39;t stay for dinner but we plan to go back, as we&#39;re big fans of northern Italian.  Based on the size of the restaurant, the &#34;buzz&#34; of the crowd, and the 4.5 rating on Yelp, I&#39;m confident dinner will exceed your expectations."

I also had a glass of their Zinfandel, and he had a glass of the Malbec. I would say the wine was pretty good. I thought the drink list being on an iPad was also a nice touch.

One of my friend arrived first and they allowed her to sit at a larger table while the rest of us came later, which was nice.  A lot of restaurants won&#39;t do that, esp during a busy Happy Hour.  They have a great cocktail menu with drinks for only $6.  I got the Freckled Daisy (a pear and Elderflower mixture) and it was delicious.  The second drink I ordered I didn&#39;t like as much (can&#39;t recall what it was); I should have stuck with the Freckled Daisy.  Food was also good at $5 to $8 a plate.  The portions are rather small, though, so I&#39;m not sure if these are Happy Hour portions or regular portions, but the food was good.  I got the Scallop and Risotto - risotto wasn&#39;t as creamy though the scallop was good (but not as good as the one at Rioja; then again, nothing is) along with the Brussels Sprouts (which were very good - sweet and crisp).  Friends got the chicken (a bit dry), mushroom pizza ( I didn&#39;t have any but my friend liked it), and gnocci (a bit too starchy for me, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of gnocci).  Also, one friend said they had the second best Manhattan cocktail she&#39;s had.  Thumbs up!"

My only complaint was that one of the eggs on my eggs Benedict was not runny at all.  I did not feel like sending it back, so its not a full complaint I guess.  But the rest of the dish was very good."

App: The calamari- this is the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars. dish and sauce had great flavor, but how can you possibly serve calamari that isn&#39;t crispy? This seems to be a common complaint on Yelp- fix this, panzano!

Entrees: carbonara and lamb Ragu
Side: gnocchi in pomodoro sauce
Desert: tiramisu"

My friend had a couple beers, at $4 each; they have $6 glasses of wine and $6 cocktails. I ended up getting a Manhattan (house-made and barrel aged) for $9, which normally goes for $15. Also had a couple of happy hour appetizers, the brussel sprouts and the pastiche (meatballs with tortellini). What was the most impressive part of Panzano was the extensive list of happy hour options, from the beer/wine/liquor I mentioned above, to the generous selection of $5, $6, and $7 happy hour plates that are offered, ranging from almond with rosemary salt ($5) to pesto gnocchi ($7). The servings aren&#39;t humongous, but are consistent with the price. Good service and nice venue, as well as three outdoor tables for outdoor seating. Had a good happy hour experience here and would recommend to others."

The private room in the back was very private and the service was exceptional. I enjoyed the Rabbit Gnocci, and it was filling for what looked to be a small serving at first glance. However, I really couldn&#39;t have eaten anything more after dinner. Of course, I also enjoyed the prosciutto appetizer... The grilled salad... And a salted caramel dessert. It was quite the evening. The drinks were also very good (Makers Old Fashioned was my go to that evening). I&#39;d go back without a second thought. Five stars!"

I ordered the Brussels sprouts and the special - scallops with risotto. Oh-my-goodness, the taste was amazing!

Let&#39;s start with the Brussels sprouts - my favorite vegetable. They made Brussels sprouts better than I&#39;ve ever had before. My mouth is drooling thinking about it now. The scallops were seared to perfection. I don&#39;t even know how they make scallops like that. It was freaken delicious!! 

I was so full that I couldn&#39;t take part in dessert. I was told happy hour is from 2:30-6p. I wish I came back after work that day, but I didn&#39;t.

As for our meals, everything was delicious - I think the star of the apps was the brussel sprouts - wow, the most delectable preparation! We all enjoyed our soup or salads and our main entrees.

I don&#39;t even know where to start!  We had a group of six and ordered three appetizers.  The waiter recommended all three and of course, they were amazing.  The brussel sprouts were topped with granny smith apples which added just the right amount to the flavor.  I&#39;m not even sure how to explain the Fico Bruciato, except that it melted in my mouth.  Everybody in the group was impressed.

We then asked the waiter what we should order for dinner, and he recommended the Pastiche and Carbonara alla Panzano.  Of course those are the only two items that the group ordered.  We were a talkative group so it didn&#39;t seem long until our entrees arrived.  The smell was amazing and the taste even better.  The Pastiche meat balls were awesome with the right amount of spice.  The whole dish was amazing.  The Carbonara was delicious as well.  The fried egg on top was just the right amount of touch to make the dish.

Not only was the food excellent, but the service was phenomenal.  I can ever recall my water glass being empty and I drink a lot of water.  Our waiter was hilarious!  He was brutally honest about the dishes and was a joy to have.  He even asked another waitress about the toppings on the dish and her reply was funny as well.

I don&#39;t think I have given five stars, but this place deserves it.  You will probably end up spending $100 between two people, but it was well worth it.  I highly recommend going here with a group!  I plan on bringing my visitors here so they can see an awesome Denver Italian restaurant.  Keep up the good work."

Panzano&#39;s has been churning out gourmet Italian for a long time now. Personally, I have been coming since 2001, probably dozens of times and it is always superior food and service! 

The pastas are home made and you cannot go wrong.  The menu changes and there is always something new and delicious to try.  The wine list is sophisticated, and the waitstaff is knowledgeable.  This is a white tablecloth establishment, with crumb brushes, multiple sets of customized silverware, and first class service rarely encountered anywhere anymore.

My most recent visit was a business dinner, and we tried several new incredible dishes.  The Brussels sprouts appetizer was amazing, as was the flatbread with proscuitto- yum!  I had a grilled caesar salad that was smokey and perfect with one fat anchovy.  One of my dining companions had a meatball and pasta dish that was served in a pot- the waitstaff called it &#34;the magic pot&#34; and I have to say that was the item the rest of us wished we ordered, though all of us were happy with our meals.

You just can&#39;t go wrong here, and is a must-dine in Denver."

The calamari was okay, pretty basic, but the carbonara had a watery,  flavorless sauce and the noodles were over cooked. I was so disappointed because I love carbonara and I used to make it at home all the time. The steak was served with plain boiled potatoes instead of the garlic ones listed on the menu. And the service was a subpar,  our server didn&#39;t know what the 5 course meal consisted of and didn&#39;t bother to check. He was like... Eh... I wouldn&#39;t recommend it anyway....

I got one of the pasta dishes. It started out great and then I took a bite to find a piece of metal wire in the sauce. When I told the waiter, he said it must have been part of the fryer basket. I pointed out that nothing on my dish was fried so that seemed unlikely. He agreed, apologized, took the dish and said he would have the chefs fire a new one right away. I told him no thank you as I didn&#39;t have much appetite after that, but he didn&#39;t listen. He brought it out after a few minutes, we ordered drinks, and he never came back. That was literally the last time we saw him, but he was waiting on other tables right around us, just completely avoiding us. I asked another waiter for a manager who never came and then finally gave up and asked for the check. Nothing was taken off of the bill and in fact, the drinks we never received were on there. We asked for a new check with that removed and asked for a comp on just my pasta dish that had metal in it. Well that didn&#39;t happen, they never came back with a new check, not even one with just the drinks that were never received removed. We paid in cash and just short paid it.

I walked outside and on the same block was Panzano&#39;s. It was in between lunch and dinner time, so they were only open for happy hour with only a handful of patrons. I entered and inquired if there is lunch offered at this time. The server said that the happy hour menu has many items that I would like and gave me a menu and a table to sit at to review. She was right. I ordered the fried Brussel Sprouts and the veal canaloni. The Brussels sprout dish was the most delicious dish I ever ate hands down! Fried to a light crispness with a delicious apple cider reduction with chopped pistachios and julienned apple on top. It blew me away. I told my server I wanted the recipe. She brought me the recipe! I was shocked they gave that out! She said the dish is so loved that people ask for it all the time! 
My server Joan was so sweet. I asked her lots of questions about how to get around town here in Denver and she showed me how on my iPhone! Young people know all the apps and clever ways to get around. Luckily it wasn&#39;t busy and she could give me that special attention. I appreciated it. She didn&#39;t have to help me with Denver questions. They are lucky to have her. She was genuine. 
Outside of my great experience with Joan, the food was excellent! The butterscotch Carmel pudding was pure heaven. And the green tea was of high quality. I wanted to sit there and drink tea all afternoon. I will definitely bring my husband there when he joins me here in Denver tomorrow! Yum!"

Two of us ordered the daily omelette. It was just okay and the potatoes/peppers served with it were cold. One person ordered pastries and they were cold...they were still flaky, but maybe overdone?

Likely we should have gone for dinner, but just couldn&#39;t bring ourselves to go back for what could be another disappointing and expensive meal. $80 for breakfast (3 people) that wasn&#39;t very good and included zero alcohol seems expensive to me."

Our table fell in love with the mussels. or more specifically, the sauce (wine based) that it was made in. The Pastiche had different layers of awesomeness..the red sauce, the meatballs, the pasta. The lamb in one of the dishes was braised perfection and all the pasta in all the dishes were excellent. The drinks were excellent and also one of the best Manhattans I&#39;ve ever had. Our table actually made it to dessert and tried tiramisu and a apple pastry. Both desserts tasted great. The tiramisu in particular was incredibly fluffy, rich, and light. Our only complaint was that we preferred darker roast coffee and the baker used light roast.

The place has a charming ambience as it is connected to one of the older Denver hotels. It&#39;s not quiet but we were not looking for quiet. I would recommend business casual for dress or a step up. Our waiter was a professional. He didn&#39;t bother us with the ubiquitous statements &#34;How is everything? Did everything taste great? Let me know if you need anything?

I totally dig this place.  Been here maybe 6-7 times the past couple of years and it always delivers quality, tasty, interesting food, well presented and well served.

Some faves:
Grilled calamari 
Grilled caesar
Rucola salad (and thanks Panzano for calling it what it is...not Arugula!)
A lamb ragu with hand made ribbon pasta, maybe maltagliatte or similar
Scallops with I think a spinach dumpling?

Going from memory and not notes.  

I find the wine list here to be very reasonably priced all things considered, and the selections are thoughtful.  There are the expected crowd pleasers but also a few interesting selections for the oenophiles.

Service is always great.  Bartenders friendly.

Ambiance maybe the weakest link here, but it&#39;s still quite pleasant...not meant to be a knock, just everything else is so good :)

And for the price, this is a five star on my list (maybe a 4.5, but consistency kicks it over to 5)

Buongustaio!

The chefs were so awesome and so entertaining and there was so much camaraderie and teamwork. It felt like a sporting event with how busy they were.

And calamari) all the way to our main dish (I had osso bucco OMG with that bone marrow holy SH*T, I dipped my bread in that mixed with the sauce) I died and went to heaven with every bite. The menu I was given was for restaurant week so it was a 4 course meal for $30. But to be very honest, I would&#39;ve gladly paid the individual price for each one of them.

Happy Hour: 4-5 stars. Hence the 3 stars. 

So I come here for the best happy hour in Denver on a regular basis as I work down the street but I have never had dinner here and I was looking to take my parents out for a nice dinner all of my top choices were already fully committed with reservations (Saturday night at 7pm). I didn&#39;t want to risk going somewhere I hadn&#39;t tried before and wanted something that was fairly conservative with the menu choices for the folks. So after much deliberation, I thought I would try this old standby thinking even though it&#39;s not a new restaurant they would deliver on the food. I was wrong while it wasn&#39;t all bad it wasn&#39;t good either. 

Our bill came to $224. We ordered 4 drinks... they have awesome bartenders who know how to make a stiff drink. We also ordered the Melanzane Fritte it&#39;s ok and the eggplant was perfectly prepared as I had remembered, but it&#39;s not something it&#39;s not something I crave to eat again. My dad who regularly dines at 5 star steak restaurants and is pretty picky ordered the Bistecca alla Griglia, he asked several questions on how the steak was prepared and how many ounces etc. He was told it was a bone in 12 ounces and came with drizzle of pesto sauce, this description was poor. We all laughed when he received his dish with little triangles of steak on a plain plate of mashed potatoes. It was so sad what they did to that poor steak and tasted just ok. I don&#39;t even want to discuss the price. Most people who order a bone in want it left on the bone unless maybe you are at the cheesecake factory and then I expect this. 

Here is what really gets my blood boiling! The other dish we ordered carbonara was not a carbonara. It was bucatini tossed in JUST garlicky olive oil that collected in a pool at the bottom of the plate, with a super sad and teeny over done whole fried egg. Gross. This is where I become very bewildered with confusion. Was this intentional? Surely Panzano an Italian establishment of 10 years knows that a carbonara is made by coating pasta in a rich, creamy sauce of eggs, cheese, and pork.... right?? 
Literally it was sent out in a broth of oil, and oil.

I should have know that this place is only good for business meals where it&#39;s not a big deal to drop $200 on a mediocre meal that can be expensed later, and of course happy hours which is a whole different menu."

They brought out an iPad that had their wine selection and we picked a fantastic barbera/pinot noir blend.  Our waiter was awesome, I think his name was Jose.  He was very friendly and knowledgeable.  We started with the calamari and I loved the spicy aioli that it came with.  The tapenade that they serve with the bread was awesome too.  My only complaint is that we ordered the carbonara alla Panzano (to split) and mine had so many onions the smell and taste was overpowering.  My boyfriend&#39;s bowl had like none.  I don&#39;t like onions and have never seen them in a carbonara so I wish it&#39;d been described that way on the menu.  We also ordered dessert and his tiramisu was superb.

I get what they&#39;re going for, unique dishes with an Italian flare. Got it. Now if they could only assemble those according to flavors and textures that work well together, then they&#39;d be onto something.

I started off with the limoncello vodka drink. It was okay, nothing to write home about, and I didn&#39;t ask for a second.

The breads were delicious, but came out with a strange dipping sauce. I adore olive oil and will consume it with almost anything mixed in, but this dipping sauce had an odd flavor that didn&#39;t compliment the bread.

I went with the Gnocchi con Coniglio; gnocchi, rabbit, leeks, shallots, gorgonzola, pickled tomatoes, and olive oil. These are all things that I really enjoy. I&#39;d only had rabbit once before, but it was a positive experience. I had the pickled tomatoes on the side as that was the only thing that sounded like it could make this taste funny. Wrong. This was just weird. If you want gnocchi, go to Guard &amp; Grace. All of these ingredients do not taste good together and the texture was funky. After two bites, I stopped. I didn&#39;t know what to do. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever disliked a dish for it&#39;s ingredients after I&#39;m the one who chose it by those ingredients (my issues are typically with surprise ingredients or poor cooking time management).
My waiter was great and offered to get me something else. Not much else on the menu had struck me as exciting, so I asked for something with shrimp, any pasta, garlic, and olive oil, marinara, or alfredo sauce. I was done with adventurous choices. A Shrimp Scampi came out and it filled me up. It was good, but I didn&#39;t feel the need to take the leftovers back to my hotel.

I finished off with a blood orange cream gelato. This made me giggle. It was like eating a creamsicle and reminded me of childhood. What was I doing eating frozen stuff while it&#39;s 20*F and windy outside... I don&#39;t really know, but it was the happiest part of my meal."

Service - (Brian was our waiter) was attentive and professional.  Drinks - strong.  

We had the Calamari appetizer, I have rarely had such light and crisp calamari.  I had the grilled Ceasar salad - very good, and my companion had the beet soup (very generous portion)

He also had the Eggplant entree, and I was jealous I did not get it as well.  As he said, &#34;I would come back here tomorrow night and get the same thing&#34;.    I had the wild boar pasta and honestly it was a bit disappointing, not much flavor to it.

We had the sorbet for dessert and a very well made double espresso for me.

I&#39;m not sure I get the negative reviews here; the same executive chef runs Panzano that did a decade ago, and they are still putting out great food and great service. It&#39;s not cheap; with tax and tip and two drinks each this meal ran $180.  But still worth it in my book."

I got the chicken soup. I wish it would have had a little more flavor, but it was hot, and filled me up. It was a very generous portion.

Like really, really authentic. The Chinese grandma in the back making the potstickers and noodles herself by hand. Just heed my advice; 1) order the potstickers and 2) don&#39;t forget them because in all likelihood you&#39;ll have finished the main part of the meal before they arrive, and you just might forget about them. This just happened to me the second time in a row. I also ordered the roast duck wonton soup. Delicious. You&#39;d think you just got feed at a night market in China, only better. Fresh made noodles and wonton, rich homemade poultry broth, and scrumptious roast duck ($13). Still waiting for the potstickers right now as I wrote this review. 
     It is poorly managed however. Last time (and just now), like I just said, they forgot my dumplings, but really they were taking forever to make them.  This time I sat down to eat and none of the tables were clean, food scraps all over them. Gross.

The chicken soup is a huge disappointment. I&#39;ve tried it 3 times now but every time I regret getting it. It&#39;s too oily and the broth just isn&#39;t good. I love soup and I wish it was better as it&#39;s so close to me.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Zoe Ma Ma&#39;s location is more than ideal right there next to the train station, and while it was within an hour of closing when I strolled in on a Friday night, the staff were all abundantly friendly and willing to explain the concept to me. I placed my order, took a seat, and had my food in about ten minutes. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

For $6.99 i had a hearty portion of Zhajiangmian and for $2.79 more I had a steamy bun filled with ground beef. That&#39;s in line with what you&#39;d pay for a standard Thai or Vietnamese dish, and it&#39;s a fair price point. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

I&#39;ve had Zhajiangmian across China and Taiwan, and I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s slightly different than what I had here at Zoe Ma Ma. Traditional Zhajiangmian often consists of a unique soybean paste mixed with stir-fried ground beef or pork, and I was looking forward to having that unique flavor replicated. To my slight surprise, the Zha Jiang Mian at Zoe Ma Ma tasted more like ground beef bolognese that you might find at an Italian restaurant. It was still a decent combination with the chopped carrots, cucumber, chives, and cilantro, but it wasn&#39;t what I was expecting. The steamy bun had a nice exterior but the interior was a bit of a basic ground beef combination and wasn&#39;t really anything to write home about. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I&#39;ll be back to Zoe Ma Ma to sample some other goods, but in the meantime there&#39;s still a bit of room for improvement. No Star Granted."

I was craving some good Chinese.  Not take-out Chinese but something spicy, salty, yet still a bit on the healthier side.  Enter Zoe Ma Ma with their dim sum selection (think small plates and single order dumplings/potstickers), noodle soups, and rice dishes.

Come up the little flight of stairs, and place your order with the friendliest staff.  Grab a can of beer or bottled beverage to the your left, of the cashier, if you&#39;re opting out of the house made teas or filtered water. Head over to the condiment station, which looks overwhelming, but really isn&#39;t.  Unfortunately most of the soy sauce based sauces tasted like... well soy sauce.  

Got the beef noodle soup and was expecting the contrast of seasoned/braised beef, beefy broth against the sour pickled cabbage. I have been spoiled with really authentic Sichuan and Taiwanese food and it was a bit bland. 

BF got the dan dan mein and I wish the good stuff didn&#39;t just stick to the bottom of the bowl and stuck to some of the noodles. Not bad flavor but was really good when rice was mixed in.

The pearl dumpling was good and the crystal shrimp dumplings, not so impressed. The crystal shrimp dumplings was super over steamed and the casing did not hold in the shrimp. 

Overall, not a bad place to get some decent authentic Chinese!"

My wife ordered a steamed bun (bao). It was good, but definitely a lot more expensive than the steamed buns at more traditional dim sum restaurants on Federal and Alameda. Given that rent at Union Station is probably a lot higher, it&#39;s understandable. She also ordered the cool noodles. It was a surprisingly large amount of food. The bowl of cool (not cold) lo mein noodles and loads of fresh veggies were very refreshing, especially on a hot July evening.

When we walked in, I immediately noticed two Asian women making dumplings by hand behind the register. I assume they were the owners (mother and daughter, maybe?). It reminded me of the many hours spent making dozens of dumplings at a time with my own grandma when I was a child.

I definitely recommend Zoe Ma Ma. It is very reasonably priced considering its LoDo location and the unique tastes are a welcome addition to Union Station."

Order noodles or dim sum if you dine here. The portions are not big, but they can feed a regular sized person and appetite. I tried a little Dan Dan noodle and it was pretty tasty. Noodles are quite good and the toppings had good flavor. 

I would not recommend the chicken salad. Why did I ordered a chicken salad instead of noodles? It was a hot day and a cold salad sounded refreshing. It arrived dry and bland, even with the dressing it was one of the lamest salads ever.

Tell me - why put your agenda on the public when you don&#39;t even have table service?   Just up your prices to cover overhead...oh well.

I think technically the food was probably shy of four stars, but their awesome digs at Union Station made up (great patio).  The dish was good (reminds me of Dan Dan) but was lacking enough sauce in my opinion leaving the noodles a bit dry.  The noodles, however, were standout - obviously homemade and delicious.

The two Zoe Ma Ma locations are different. I most recently had the vegetarian noodles at this location. The price was very reasonable considering where it is (great people watching!) and that they use quality ingredients. After I figured out that there was a pool of delicious sauce at the bottom of my bowl and mixed that goodness in with the noodles, I had a satisfying meal. It had the crunch of fresh veggies, the noodles were quality, and the sauce that wasn&#39;t too salty or sweet. I like that Zoe Ma Ma has several in-house sauces for the taking so you can be your own mixmaster and add a splash of spice to your already good base dish. 

Most Asian restaurants that I have been to have a terrible beer selection. Not here. Cans from Oskar Blues, etc.

Not a great selection for a vegetarian, but I tried some vegan dumplings and also the vegetarian noodles. The best part of the restaurant is the different chili oils to put on your food - otherwise, everything was quite underwhelming.

The dumplings were nuclear hot, and since they stuck to the steamer and were torn we got a spare. Honestly, they could&#39;ve kept the spare - without the chili oil it was just a mouthful of unseasoned tofu &amp; mushroom. The noodles were okay, once again they were mostly just a vector for the chili sauce.

If this is what &#34;yummy taiwanese street food&#34; is, then I don&#39;t think I want to eat anymore of it. 
I&#39;ve had wonton soup several times before, and it was much much better than here. The wonton soup here hardly tasted like anything and was not even worth the space in my stomach it took up. 
The Lion&#39;s head and zi jiang were also bland, but not as bad as the wonton soup.

I honestly wanted to like this place because the concept was rather cool:  fast Taiwanese street food brought to you by mama Zoe.  However, the food was shy of perfection.

My boyfriend and I came here for a Wednesday night date night.  I ordered the Wednesday special which was the Lion Head; a saucy pork meatball with shiitake mushroom, napa cabbage, bamboo shoots, and rice.  My boyfriend ordered the Za Jiang Mian; a classic northern Chinese noodle dish made with egg noodles, ground pork, and julienne vegetables.  We also ordered the crystal shrimp dumplings; which turned out pretty bland.  As for the special Lion Head, there was nothing special about it.  In fact, there were a few ingredients in the bowl that I had bit into and had to immediately spit out.  For instance, the bowl contained large slices of ginger.  The ginger slices are so large that I mistaken it for bamboo shoots.  It wasn&#39;t very pleasant.  However, the Za Jiang Mian was good.  I wish I had ordered that instead.

For the price point Zoe Mama is decent.  Furthermore, they do add an additional 15% onto your ticket for service/upkeep of the place so tipping is not necessary."

There is a &#34;secret&#34; menu so thankfully I overheard the person before me ordering the scallion pancake or I wouldn&#39;t have known of its existence.  

We ordered our food and the staff was very nice.  The food is brought out to your table so you just take a seat and relax.  Well first you go to the sauce station and load up on delicious sauces for your dumplings and various other items and then you take a seat.

The scallion pancake was the first to come out and it was my favorite of the night.  Crispy and salty with just the right amount of onion, this was a home run!  Especially with the sauces drizzled over the top.  

I also got the potsticker which was good but not mind blowing for me, the vegan dumpling which was not a winner for me and a steamed pork bun which I enjoyed.

For my main, I got the duck soup noodle soup which was fantastic!  I also added some spice and seasoning to take up the heat level.  The duck was very flavorful as was the broth.  And who doesn&#39;t love slurping noodles up?  This is the perfect meal for a cold winter night.

One of my co-workers asked if I wanted to go out to lunch and check out something different and five minutes later I found myself at Zoe Ma Ma.

The place is tucked among the restaurants at Union Station in downtown and has a very fun cozy vibe. We went here on a gray, rainy day and hot food sounded like the perfect solution. 

I ordered the house special and a steamy bun. The bun was fabulous - doughy goodness stuffed with meat. The house special was only okay. They are known for their noodles and I didn&#39;t love them. In addition, it seemed to be mainly noodles without much meat or veggies. The ratio didn&#39;t seem very high with regards to what you got substance-wise. They were good but not my favorite. 

My only other issue was they seemed to be having computer issues - no biggie I get tech stuff break downs. But the manager seemed to be getting mad at his staff in front of his patrons and I can never agree with someone who gets upset while their employees are trying to do their job. The cashier was trying to take our orders on the working computer while he worked on the other. He kept trying to switch her off and getting irritated when she wanted to complete our order before moving computers. I didn&#39;t quite get it.

I also LOVE their no tipping concept. Fast, fresh, and healthy is how it goes down here. Although there are plenty vegan and vegetarian options they need to add MORE veggies. More in each dish and more variety. Broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots would take their noodle dish from pretty good to really good. A vegetarian soup in winter might be amazing too!

The chicken noodle soup is a hearty meal, great tasting chicken stock base, plenty of white meat and the taste is delicious. Pork buns are good, potstickers are home made and the variety of dipping sauces is excellent.

I went twice this week, and the second time took a colleague. He loved it too. I told Mama Zoe that my family is chinese. She instantly started talking to me in Cantonese (which I dont speak). After we were half through our meal, she wanders over with a plate of fried rice which she had just cooked and like a real mother, insisted we try. We ate it all - it was fantastic.

I couldnt care less about the 15% automatic service charge (which some others have griped about). If thats them being quirky, who cares. I just want this place to do well and stay around for a long time."

I went with a group of 6 guys. 
We all ordered right after one another. 
Each of us ate at different times because the food came out so erratically. 
For example: we gave our name to go with our order and the girl delivering the food to the tables was so confused it was distracting. 
After receiving her food she would continually come up to us even when we were done eating trying to give us someone else&#39;s order. We were literally about to get up after finishing our meal and she asked A table of six guys: &#34;Maggie?&#34; 

But the rating is based on service and food. 
Food took forever and the dumplings were not flavorful at all. 
The noodle dishes were so flavorless it was almost a joke, my friends didn&#39;t touch it after a couple bites.
Dumplings were burned, and their meatball dumpling covered in rice was hardened. 
The whole experience was messy too. 
Tiny tables yet they decide to give you giant trays. 
We were spelling our sauce that came in tiny sauce bowls through the holes in the cheap outdoor table. 
The spoon for the sauces inside were giant while the sauce trays were tiny. 
People had spilled sauce all over the floor. 
This place is in such a prime location, yet they fail on so many levels.

Oolong tea was great.

The cashier did not know the menu well. Also, he welcomed me to an authentic &#34;Chinese&#34; restaurant. Where did Taiwanese come from? OR was that due to his lack of knowledge?

I first came here out of some friends&#39; recommendation. I always struggle to decide what to get so it&#39;s helpful that the menu is really simple. My first time here, a lot of the items I had wanted to try (pearl meat ball and hot &amp; sour soup) ran out so I ended up getting the Steamy bun (bao) with pork and potstickers.The marinated pork in the bun is really flavorful and authentic, I wish I ordered another bun... What I liked about the potstickers were that they were crispy on the side. My friends really enjoyed the CPR and roast duck wonton noodle soup. One thing to note is that some of the items are only served on certain days (e.g. roast duck wonton noodle soups are only available Fri and Sat). 

Besides the great food, I love the atmosphere. The restaurant has a decent amount of seating and cute Asian décor (tea sets, newspaper design tables, etc.). The waiters and chef are super friendly too. My favorite person in the store has to be Zoe Ma Ma though. Because this store is fairly new, she&#39;s been at this store making sure operations are going well. The first time I was here, she gave me a goji rice cake for free and talked to me about her new restaurant and what cool breakfast menus she plans to have. Because I didn&#39;t get to try to pearl meat balls my first time, when I went back to the restaurant later that week, she pulled me over and gave me an extra one on the house. She definitely knows how to treat her customers and makes them feel at home! (Although I think the fact that I speak Mandarin helps)

This place is tucked in on Wynkoop right on the side of the Union Station. If you&#39;re looking for a place for Asian food, definitely give this place a try!"

I would also say that it is not a traditional dim sum, so if you are looking to gorge yourself on dim sum, go to Asian Super Star or something. Zoe Ma Ma has a select amount of home-style Taiwanese food, and it&#39;s pretty delicious. Note: this is TAIWANESE food, not to be confused with THAI food, which is from a different country (Thailand) and has significantly different flavors. I&#39;m sure you can find cheaper Taiwanese somewhere outside downtown or in a Chinatown in a bigger city, but for the location and the quality of food, me and my family left very satisfied. 

The noodles are organic and homemade, which are an added bonus. We enjoyed the CPR, Beef Noodle, Za Jiang Mian, some potstickers, and sampled a marinated pork steam bun. It was like eating many of the favorite things that my mom might make, and I didn&#39;t leave feeling completely bombed with sodium like with a lot of Chinese restaurant food. I think this is where other reviewers felt disappointed about &#34;bland&#34; tastes, but really, most Chinese restaurants probably meet your daily sodium intake in one dish!!

Luckily, the Taiwanese (etc.) food served at the downtown branch of Zoe Ma Ma lives up to such lofty praise.

Let&#39;s begin with a small nibble, shall we? I&#39;m always a sucker for a good Jiaozi (dumpling) and ZMM&#39;s are some of the best I&#39;ve tried in recent memory. These shrimp/pork/chive-packed wonders are of the Guotie (literally, &#34;sticks to the pan&#34;) variety - fried on one side first, then steamed to succulence. Speaking of steamed things, their buns (or if you prefer, Bao) are almost as noteworthy as mine (ahem) - the marinated pork (Cha Siu) and curried chicken (Gali Ji) ones stand out in particular as I&#39;m typing this. Zhen Zhu Wan Zi (glutinous rice-dappled pork balls) are another intriguing introduction for you to consider. As luck would have it, these are all so affordably priced, you could even try a few of each in one sitting - and it probably comes as no surprise to hear that I&#39;ve been known to do precisely that!

To continue, how about a little CPR? No, I&#39;m not being presumptuous, so cut that out. Those three tiny letters actually refer to one of the most comforting creations on offer at ZMM - namely, a chicken and potato stew featuring just a touch of ginger and star anise, with plenty of steamed rice (or even noodles if you&#39;re so inclined) to soak it all up. On the lighter side, there&#39;s always the cold salad called Liang Ban Mian (egg noodles tossed with bean sprouts and cucumbers) to keep you feeling gratified, yet guilt-free. And depending on which day you visit, you might get to try one of their specials, like Niu Rou Mian (braised Sichuan-style numbing-hot beef with noodles) or even Shi Zi Tou (Shanghainese stewed meatballs, colloquially called &#34;lion&#39;s heads&#34; due to their size). It&#39;s all ripe for the picking at Zoe Ma Ma."

I ordered - Lion Head 
$7.95
Ginormous saucy pork meatball served with shitake mushroom, napa cabbage, bamboo shoots and rice.  Rice noodle and fresh organic egg noodle available. 

The meatball was delicious and yes ginormous and plenty of cabbage. However only one little mushroom and bamboo shoots were not included. I ordered it with the rice noodles and they didn&#39;t skimp there. And note they use bok choi. I didn&#39;t realize bok choi is also called napa cabbage. Initially I thought it was pretty bland until I discovered they have 4-5 sauce options on the counter.

My meal and green tea ended up being $12.30 because they include a 15% gratuity. I&#39;m ok with this but will likely skip the $2.50 tea next time. Wasn&#39;t too impressive.

I say all this but I will be back because my friend&#39;s food looked more appealing. And I like simple fresh food and do you know how hard it is to make a meatball that size that is still moist and flavorful? I just hope next time they are more generous with the ingredients."

Here&#39;s my story... I was excited to try this place and drove through 40 minutes of traffic to get there within Denver. I LOVED the food here and Mama Zoe is a really cute lady, but I&#39;m ranking 3 stars only because I felt their 15% tip was deceiving. I ordered 2 dishes and my total came out to $26? It was my first time there and I didn&#39;t see the 15% sign. 

It was obvious that I was new since I was asking about portion sizes and how the process of getting your food worked.

They automatically tack on 15% to your order (for several understandable reasons), but I felt they should at least mention it or ask if you&#39;re new and point out the sign before they add 15%. It felt like a bait and switch with their prices. Maybe do an option for 5, 10 or 15%. $13 (+15%) is really $15 for a roast duck soup noodle. Tips are understandable if there was full-service.

Other than that, the food and atmosphere were great (but not for that price)."

The menu has some good options and the ordering process is simple and straight forward.  I ordered the Duck Wonton ramen bowl and a pork bun.  My biggest gripe with this place is that they automatically tack on 15% to your order for &#34;tip&#34;.  This, to me, is ridiculous.  Either put out a tip jar/swipe or raise the menu prices to cover the amount you want to tip out your staff or pay them a more reasonable wage.  Forcing your customers to tip by tacking it on after ringing up the menu prices is bad practice, and they only have a tiny little sign that they pointed to explaining it when I asked why my meal was $4 more than it added up to on the menu.   So, a bowl of noodles and a steamed bun came out to about $20.

With that said, the food was decent.  Not great, but good enough.  The ramen broth lacked flavor, so I added some chili sauce and some of another sauce they had available, and that improved it a bit, but I wish it was, well, brothier.  The skin of the duck was soaked and thus chewy and not at all crispy (would be nice if they would just sprinkle duck cracklings on top of the bowl).  The noodles were decent, but not quite as chewy as I like in a good bowl of ramen.  The duck itself was tasty, as were the wontons and baby bok choy.  The steamed bun was pretty standard.  Decent amount of filling and not dried out.  Again, good, not great.  

Would I eat here again?  Maybe if I were craving steamed buns or noodles and didn&#39;t have the option to drive somewhere better.  If Yelp&#39;s rating system allowed half stars, I&#39;d call this 3.5."

Full disclosure: I&#39;d been to the Boulder location years ago and don&#39;t remember being all that impressed but my food appreciation has matured by now, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked everything I tried.  Between the two of us, my husband and I ordered two potstickers, two steamed buns, the CPR and the Za Jiang Mian.  I loved it all!  Full of flavor, generously portioned and really satisfying in that comfort food kind of way.  I&#39;m definitely going back for the scallion pancake, Lion&#39;s Head and more steamed buns!"

I went in and ordered everything that everybody pretty much raves about:
-Original Marinated Pork and Curry Chicken Bun
-Sichuan Braised Beef Noodle
-Za Jiang Mian with Egg Noodle

First off, let&#39;s talk about pricing.
Zoe Ma Ma charges $2.79 PER Steamy Bun... Outrageously expensive when you consider that other authentic Dim Sum Restaurants such as Star Kitchen or Super Star Asian Cuisine charges $2.35 FOR AN ORDER OF THREE. 

Taste is OK at best. Both buns were good but not even close in terms of flavor to those of other Dim Sum places on Federal. (Sure Federal isn&#39;t nearly as swanky as Denver but if you&#39;re in it for the food I&#39;d go to Federal any day.) The Sichuan Braised Beef Noodle- one of the highest raved about dishes from Zoe Ma Ma- The beef was quite good but the broth itself however lacked in flavor. The Za Jian Mian is a version of &#34;Chinese Spaghetti&#34; that I just did not care for, again the sauce lacked flavor and overall just tasted like bland beef gravy. 

Not a win for me. Also they need to find a new way to call customers up for their food cause yelling their name during a busy lunch hour and expecting them to hear it regardless of whether they&#39;re inside or out is a little ridiculous- it&#39;s called buzzers."

I was excited to try this location when I heard it had opened. I used to go to the Boulder one when I worked near there. I went on a Friday around 11am. It was good timing because right after we ordered, there was a huge line and the lunch rush began. So, if you want to come to this location, make sure to get there early. I ordered the CPR but asked for vegetables instead of the chicken. The bowl consisted of rice, a few potatoes and some green veggies. There was hardly any gravy sauce on the bowl, but some was at the bottom of the bowl soaking the rice. Although the flavor was good, I just wish there was more of the gravy, or more of the veggies. It just felt like something was lacking.

Luckily I had read some reviews prior to going and knew to order the scallion pancakes. That is not listed on the menu, however it was quite delicious. 

I will probably come back to try one of their noodle bowls. Hopefully it will be a little more tasty than the CPR."

I ordered the Vegetarian on both occasions.

Their food is drowned in their &#34;sauce&#34; (nothing more than reduced onions and ginger steeped in soy sauce) and is incredibly salty.

After most literally draining a half-cup of the salty brine, I proceeded to eat the food which was incredibly one-dimensional. Between the sad blanched mish mash of bok choy, bean sprouts, undercooked zucchini and soft, bland, uncooked tofu, I could only get through half before I had to chuck this in the trash.

Instead, the wontons were meager (very little meat), and we barely got any bok choy or duck meat. Although the taste was authentic, it was not worth $13.

Once our food came out, after waiting quite awhile for seemingly fast Chinese food, it was not worth the price, the service or the wait.

Service: The people were incredibly nice, and served us very quickly. They even threw in some potstickers because it was our first time there. Also recommend the Vietnamese coffee.

Decor: Love the decor, though I&#39;m still a little confused about the random movie posters (which I still loved). Also, the tables are pretty cool looking with the local Chinese newspapers on them.

For those that view the 15% sustainability (no tipping) policy as a positive clearly don&#39;t realize how much the employees are actually getting screwed. I&#39;ve worked in a lot of restaurants, all of which have provided me with much more money per week, even on a standard server wage. Tips are what keep servers from starving and being late on rent every month. I don&#39;t know where that &#34;15%&#34; goes, but its certainly not into the pay checks of Zoe Ma Ma employees. However this isn&#39;t the only way corners are cut at the restaurant - they under-staff, forcing front of house staff to work twice as hard during peak hours (this often includes washing dishes because hiring a dish washer is of no priority). Employees are also not allowed to request time off, no matter how far in advance, and instead must find a way to get their shift covered no matter the circumstances, yet another practice virtually un-heard of in the service industry and a main reason why staff turn over at Zoe Ma Ma has to be extremely high.

like many other yelpers, definitely a change in atmosphere compare to other locations but...

1: order and food is ready in about 30 seconds.  this was after the lunch rush.  lot of customers from nearby businesses.

2: cheap!  i can almost compare to taco bell on pricing point but cant find green chili /relenos / tamales.  who am i to compare this legendary denver restaurant to Taco bell?  sorry!

3. no frills.  Definitely no frills.  only thing available is napkins.  

4.  cleanness.  they seem to try to keep it clean.  i see one of the girl cleaning in between taking orders.

5.  danger.  right below the cold table has freezer/refrigerator storage area and noticed one of the worker  placing plate of individually saran wrapped un-cooked meat few inches from lettuce and cheeses.  wow..  she was careful doing it but too close for my comfort.

over all, very good value and speedy service.

But the vibe here is just icky. To start, the restrooms are not attached to the restaurant. You have to walk out and go around the building to find them. There are no signs for this and when you ask the staff, they seem confused what you are asking for. Bathroom?

The floors and tables were dirty. Also the tables were lopsided and wobbly. At first, we sat in a booth and sank down so low because the cushions were nonexistent. We moved to a table with chairs - both times wiping the tables marked with food/drink spillage on our own.

The food: It was lunch time so we didn&#39;t get the breakfast burritos (that they are known for). But I ordered a chicken burrito deluxe (which means its smothered with chili, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese) - it was pretty good! Nothing special but I really do love the Santiago&#39;s  chili. My fiance ordered the steak burrito (not deluxe) and it was just dry and bland. He had to dip it into my chili.

The service was OK. Everyone was nice but definitely no sense of urgency, as there was a long line the entire time we were there. I would give this location 4 stars on food only if you order it to go. If you are going to eat here, the stars go down."

I approached and asked why I did not receive my burrito yet, they said there was something wrong with their machine. Really? A machine makes their burritos? The last time I had a view of the kitchen, they were rolling their own burritos and I did not see a machine.

You don&#39;t go to Coors Field to watch the Rockies play basketball.  You don&#39;t go to Taco Bell for healthy food.  So when you go to Santiago&#39;s, you are here for the breakfast burritos.  Other items I cannot vouch for and you eat them at your own risk.  

If you&#39;ve been to the location on Leetsdale, you know the drill.  Keep cool - it&#39;s like a hostage situation.  I give you the money, you give me the burritos.  Dialogue is for rookies; you only need to know the quantity and three phrases: mild, hot, or half &amp; half.  The burritos are near identical to the ones sold at Leetsdale, FREAKING DELICIOUS!  Make up some foodie adjectives in your head if you think you need more details about the food.  The bottom line is the Santiago&#39;s breakfast burrito is $2 well spent.  

I&#39;m excited that this location is finally open and we have yet another business in this cursed spot.  I think they&#39;ll stay.  The staff is working out the kinks, so the b-burrito line isn&#39;t quite as quick as the other locations, yet.

Secondly, they are completely unable to handle large orders.  I took in a typed matrix (think Chipotle fax order) of 18 burritos and they could not figure it out.  They refused to write everyone&#39;s names on the foil.  What they did write was illegible.  

They knew they had messed up the order so they threw in 10 extra burritos.

Thirty-five minutes later I was out the door.  Late for work.  Co-workers hungry.  What was supposed to be a treat turned into an ordeal.  Never again.

But this location (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s all of them) has started charged $1.24 more for breakfast burritos with NO MEAT!  So you&#39;re actually paying more for less ingredients.  The explanation was that the meat ones are pre-made.  
If they have so many requests for no meat, why don&#39;t they just pre-make some with no meat?  Why should vegetarians and people with dietary restrictions be penalized for the extra minute it takes to make a special burrito???  So disappointed.  I think I&#39;ll check the other locations."

Prior to the meal that is the topic of this review, my dining at Santiago&#39;s was limited to their yummy breakfast burritos.  I decided to give dinner a try this time.  I&#39;m not so happy about my decision.  I realize that this location is just a few weeks old and perhaps they&#39;re still working out some of the kinks.  However, that&#39;s no excuse for serving unappetizing cold food.  I ordered the cheese enchilada dinner.  It comes with rice and beans.  I ordered my food to go and it took me about three minutes to get to my final destination.  At first bite, I knew the food had been prepared way ahead of time and was not properly heated before being plated.  I had to microwave it for a couple of minutes to get it to an acceptable temperature.  At second bite, I realized that it didn&#39;t have much flavor.  I had to add salt.  Mind you, I&#39;m not one who normally salts my food but it was completely necessary.  The salt helped but not enough to make me happy.

I&#39;m glad I got the food to go.  The restaurant is very small and not very inviting for dining-in.  This experience killed my excitement.  I&#39;m not going to say I won&#39;t return but I&#39;m not in any hurry to do so."

I live a little closer and was excited for the aurora location. I am sad to say I have but only two things good to say. First all I like the flooring, the carpets at other locations are subpar. The salsa which I assume is prepackaged was identical to all other locations. I shared the small combo with my daughter. The meat was not seasoned at all, the beans taste like they came straight from a can. I also asked for the green chile on the side and much to my surprise they did so and my enchilada which I wanted sauce for. The weird thing is there are not plates when you order in, only to go boxes and plastic silverware. This was highly inconvenient to cutting our food. Not to mention my enchilada was rock hard.

We came here for brunch and was happy to see they take reservations via Yelp. I booked it then we headed over and was happy we did because it was prime brunch time plus the Broncos game was on so not a lot of seats available.

Even though we had a reservation, we got a crappy table which sucks but oh well, what can you do. We were sat all the way in the back near the beverage station and door to the patio so each time the door opened there was a huge gust of wind and could barely hear anything due to the servers stacking glasses and slamming the kitchen door when they went in. Our server was friendly but impersonal and it took a while to get our food. The food is what redeems this place--I had the Eggs Sardou for a bit of a healthier option-made with spinach, artichokes, poached eggs, bacon and hollandaise (obviously the last two aren&#39;t THAT good for you but moderation!) with roasted potatoes and practically licked the plate. My boo had some kind of breakfast plate with both brisket and sausage and the sausage was to die for.

The service was really slow and when I asked the server what was taking so long to make my fried chicken salad she explained to me that they only had one chef. That seems kind of crazy to only have one chef to serve the lunch crowd.

When the salad arrived it appeared to have been sitting under a heat lamp or something because the blue cheese dressing was warm and beginning to separate. Needless to say it was pretty gross. I would have asked for something else but I was on a tight schedule so I ate what I could stomach and got out of there."

To drink I tried the Memphis BBQ Mary, which is basically a meal in itself. It&#39;s a delicious bloody mary with a ton of stuff in it. From a deviled egg, spare rib, 2 pieces of bacon, pickle, olive and celery it was an awesome presentation. 

I had the 4 piece fried chicken meal, which is huge. The chicken is pressure fried and had crispy batter and moist tender chicken. The spiked slaw is just mediocre. I subbed tater tots for the mashed potatoes.

The reason for the 3 star rating is the hair my wife and sister in-law found in their food. My wife sent her Eggs sardou and got it back fairly quickly only to get a watery plate. This makes me think that the food was not remade and only washed off and hair picked out (gross). There was also hair in french fries. Not acceptable.

Would try again but not as great I had hoped-for."

The chicken sandwich was average, but the fried chicken salad had some of the most perfectly cooked fried chicken breast on top of it - moist with a really light, crispy crust. It was great.

We ordered a banana pudding for my daughter and it was also very good. Our server was extremely engaged and attentive, so kudos to him. 

We&#39;ll come back - since it&#39;s right around the corner from my daughter&#39;s swim class, but will probably stick to the chicken dishes."

Unfortunately the last few times I&#39;ve been in have been less than stellar. Today was the worst yet. Our food arrived close to 45 minutes after ordering and was cold on arrival. Our waitress, Katheryn, did not check on us once in this time. She forgot our starter completely, and although 2 of our group ordered bottomless Bloody Marys, we did not get refills until I complained to another staff member. In the time between ordering and when our food arrived, our waitress walked past us and refilled or checked on 3 surrounding tables. Shockingly, all these tables had men and we were a group of 3 women. This is not the first time I have noticed that people with penises are better treated and served at this establishment.

The foods not as good as I remember but this place still gets 4 stars because of our server, she was so sweet and friendly. 
I had the jambalaya and he had the steak and fries. The steak and fries was $19 and didn&#39;t have much steak at all. The jambalaya was good, plenty of meat and spicier than I expected, which was good because some places try to tone it down too much. 
One of our friends got the fried chicken and it looked sooo good! I&#39;ll get that next time! 


We had dinner here, Thursday night. I ordered a southern fried chicken salad, he ordered a half of baby back ribs with a side of large veggies and we also shared a side of green chilli cornbread and pulled pork. All of that plus a coke came to less than $50.
After looking at the drinks menu, I wouldn&#39;t drink here unless it&#39;s happy hour or thirsty Thursday. Far too expensive, $4.50 for a coors light. The special for thirsty Thursday is $5 for select cocktails. They also have whisky flights which sounded interesting and vary in price."

We ordered for take out:

Fried chicken dinner, 4 piece
Prime rib and dip sandwich
Family size side of mac and cheese
Banana pudding
Dutch apple pie

The fried chicken was dry. 
The prime rib sandwich didn&#39;t have much taste.  Hard to imagine.
The tater tots that came with the sandwich were the best part of all that we ordered.
The au jus dip tasted like beef stock from the store.
The banana pudding was gray and the portion was really small.
The Dutch apple pie had a very odd filling and was also a small piece.

The smoked wings are delicious and I wanted to keep eating them! Yum! The ribs were excellent and smoky and well seasoned, they really didn&#39;t need the sauce. The hot link was good, but maybe not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but I also like a good char on my hot link so that&#39;s probably a personal preference. The fried chicken is awesome when made fresh, but can be dry if it&#39;s been sitting for any amount of time. Same with the brisket...kind of on the dry side. We love love loved the tater tots!

I was thrilled when it was announced they were opening a location in Highlands Ranch, one of the most food challenged areas in Denver with very few decent dining options. I&#39;ve now been to the Highlands Ranch SoHo about a dozen times &amp; have for the most part been very satisfied with the service &amp; food.

Except for my visit on Friday April 15. The very busy bar service was good with some wonderfully attentive staff. The 30 minute wait time ended up being 15 minutes, so all was good so far. When seated for dinner we ordered fried green tomatoes &amp; fried okra as appetizers (I&#39;m an Okie so both are required whenever available) &amp; they were yummy as always. I&#39;m a bit of a carnivore so I normally go right for the meat. I&#39;m also a Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey snob, so I decided to veer from the norm &amp; try the Makers Mark Mac &#39;N Cheese.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a good mac &#39;n cheese, but this one was a complete miss. All the ingredients were there, three cheese sauce, elbow mac, andouille sausage, &amp; bourbon carmelized onions. So far so good, then they add sauteed bell peppers, which was an odd ingredient &amp; not in the least a good one. The end result was an almost tasteless &amp; odd dish that hard as I tried with salt &amp; pepper &amp; desire to like, was a total miss &amp; one I strongly suggest you bypass &amp; stick to the meat."

BUT was the food cooked, yes, was it flavorful like Southern food, no. I was really hoping this place would satisfy my comfort food craving, since I&#39;ve moved, but it was a big disappointment on flavor- it was very bland. 
I ordered the Brohan Brisket Sandwich and 2 orders of Brisket with macaroni and cheese and collard green sides. How did it taste? Like, cooked brisket with BBQ sauce slapped on top.

We decided to try some appetizers and ordered the Smoked Prime Rib Egg Rolls and the French Quarter Fondeux.  They were both very good.    We also decided to share the Mac and Cheese which was also good.  Now at this point my husband would have given them 5 starts as he was in heaven, however, though I thought everything was good...it was not 5 star good.
 
So, we decided to go again a few days later with a large group where we could order a bunch of stuff and try everything.  I ordered the Steak and Fries which are reminiscent of Poutine with meat.  The steak was cooked perfectly and served over waffle fries with cheese curds and brown gravy.  Again good, but not great.  It needed more gravy and was a little on the salty side.

My husband ordered the prime rib sandwich dip with melted Gruyere cheese.  It was fantastic!  Wish I would have ordered that also.

We also were able to sample the Chicken and Waffles with two chicken breasts and that was good also.  

For appetizers we tried the deviled eggs and the buffalo shrimp. I&#39;m still searching for someone the replicate the Dutch Goose&#39;s deviled eggs in Palo Alto and those he had a nice spice to them, they were more runny then I like.  The Buffalo Shrimp though were awesome.  Would get those again for sure.

I love the selection of drinks and $5 Cocktail Thursdays.  My husband loves the selection of Whiskey.  Our service both nights were 5 star and we will differently be going back.

Fried Chicken with 2 sides for $18 seems overpriced &amp; most menu items were higher than I&#39;ve experienced at other equally compared restaurants. 
The service was okay but slightly slow &amp; atmosphere was average for a BBQ/Southern restaurant. I expected a little more for the Highlands Ranch, Lonetree &amp; Centennial area. Lots of compatition all around the area.
I&#39;ll consider going back hopefully they will get it figured out but I&#39;m not in a huge hurry! We&#39;ll see if they make it?  I know they have a downtown location so hopefully the corporate  management will help get the new location worked out.  I really hope so!"

Name and sign are misleading if you&#39;re looking for true Southern food. With that said, the food there is Ok, nothing special. Average portion sizes. The horseradish in the slaw was good. Nothing memorable EXCEPT this, lol,,,I asked our waiter about the TN State emblem on the side of the building and he said he didn&#39;t know what it signified and proceeded to point out a painting of Elvis as a boxer, lololol, and how his thumbs were on the outsides of both of his gloves instead of on the inside. The painter screwed it up, lol. That&#39;s the only memorable part of the visit. Likely won&#39;t be back. If you want TN food, you gotta go to TN. Cue &#39;Rocky Top&#39;. GO VOLS!"

I had my first Southern food experience &amp; it was super yummy!  We had a whiskey flight, fried okra, fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, cornbread, ribs, and brisket.  Our whiskey flight had an incorrect shot &amp; our waitress was quick to bring us the correct one, while letting us keep the incorrect.  

Service was very attentive in the beginning of our meal but got slower &amp; less available as our meal went on.  This was only an issue when it took quite a while to get our check &amp; we were on a time crunch to get back to the babysitter.  On the topic of the check, at the beginning of the meal, the waitress graciously offered to split the check for us {we were dining with another couple} and it should&#39;ve been easy enough..one couple was sitting together on one side of the booth &amp; my husband &amp; I sat together on the other side of the booth.  However, when the bills arrived, they had paired my meal with the husband on the other side &amp; my husband with my friend sitting across from us.  It wasn&#39;t a huge issue, as our bills were almost identical, but did show a level of inattention &amp; offered a slight frustration as we didn&#39;t have time to have it fixed.

Overall, I think it was delicious &amp; I can forgive less than stellar service. We will definitely be back."

The BBQ was nothing to be impressed with.  We also arrived at about 8:30pm on a Friday night and with still being open for hours the waitstaff was already sweeping and mopping the floors which made us feel like we were unwelcome and a hassle to them.  This should not be the feeling in a restaurant on a Friday night but I guess in the suburbs the dinner crowd is earlier.  We may try the downtown location.

We ordered the fried pickles (which were great!), I had the jambalaya (B-) and she ordered the catfish fillets with half/half tea.  The catfish had no flavor and the &#34;spicy&#34; cole slaw was a joke and as bland as it gets.  My food was actually a tad above average, but her food was very poor in flavor and this place isn&#39;t super expensive, but it isn&#39;t cheap.  The server we had was really great and came off genuine.  We have a lot of options in Colorado when it comes to food, so I will not be returning to this place."

Maybe the rest of the food is good but honestly this is Colorado transplant yuppie BBQ. 
The brisket was just cuts of a pot roast. 
No smoke flavor and no smoke ring. Lots of gristle and dry. Served on two thin pieces of bread they call Texas toast. 
You want a variety of BBQ sauce to try to get this dry cow flesh down?  Nope!  They only have one and they slather on like it or not.

We quit going after several bouts with dry cheesy grits and a few other recent misses.

After a quick check, I agreed that this place is worth trying out.  I will never say no to BBQ, so with excitement I hurried over.  When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the interior decor.  Most BBQ places believe that you must have the old and rustic look, but most take it to a level of a dump, as if it&#39;s appropriate and desirable.  Not here, the walls are lined with dark oak planks that give the southern feel, but at the same time have a clean finish.  They even placed some Jack Daniel barrels in the front for that southern touch.  The neon light signs throughout finished the look.  The bar is quite long and its backlit wall is stocked with spirits and extended variety of bourbon and whiskey.  You name it, they probably have it; no surprise they have whisky flights available on their drink menu.  The chef is from Texas and is big on partaking in BBQ competitions according to the bartender.

Eating alone, I sat at the bar and was greeted by Cody, who as most bartenders was friendly and actually knew a thing or two about the food they serve. The menu had the usual suspects; I decided to try their Baby Back Ribs (half rack) and side of Mac N Cheese.  To drink, I went with a local brew by Lone Pine Brewing Co., which was tasty.  They had a two for one special that evening, which I didn&#39;t get to take advantage of being too full stuffed with dinner and dessert.  All of their rib selections can be ordered either dry or wet.  I usually go with the dry rub when available, as you truly get to taste the meat without any sauce camouflage.  The ribs were delivered promptly with the Mac N Cheese piping hot.  The dry rub was excellent, with a slight ting of spice.  The meat was pink and throughly smoked, definitely apparent in its flavor.  I usually go for the beef ribs as they have more meat on the bone.  Cody also brought over some warm thick spicy and sweet original BBQ sauces in case I wanted to try them, which I did and loved.  The fact that the sauces were warmed up was a welcomed touch.  I also loved the Mac N Cheese, especially how the recipe included both stringy cheese on top and Velveeta cheese underneath.  I finished the whole thing even though the portion was generous.  At the end, I had to try their Bourbon Bread Pudding, and I&#39;m super glad I did.  The bread pudding resembled a cinnamon roll, but much denser garnished with a bourbon flavored sweet cream.  The portion was insane, easily shareable between two adults.  You guessed it, I licked the plate.

Very cool, clean looking and hospitable barbecue restaurant."

I had heard in the past that the food was overpriced for the quality, but I wanted to give it a shot myself. No one greeted me at the door, and finally a waitress saw me (she was rather busy) and took the time to seat me, which I was grateful that somebody cared!

Our waitress was a manager, I think, because she was dressed differently and did a few other things that seemed management like. Odd. The fried pickles were amazing, I was very impressed! Two of our meals were delivered in a timely manner, and my dad&#39;s dish was missing for a several minutes. Finally, I see at the table next to us, who was being served their dishes, that our waitress angrily grabs an order of chicken and waffles off the table, berates the other server for stealing her dish, and proceeds to deliver it to our table. Our waitress said nothing to us, but I was absolutely shocked! Mistakes happen, people. 

Overall the food wasn&#39;t bad, the pulled pork was unnecessarily dry, but the side dishes and other entrees were yummy. I would agree that it is a little over priced for the quality, but might be a nice place for some happy hour drinks and apps. Haven&#39;t ruled it out altogether!"

The chicken and waffles were more of a chore to eat because they are bone in and the southern fried chicken was pretty uneventful with not much flavor. I had to request a side of gravy to make it more than just something I could get from Church&#39;s or KFC (even there I could get gravy). I was really hoping for a chicken fried steak, but I didn&#39;t see one on the menu. Probably won&#39;t make a trip out of my way to come here again."

This is what happens when a restaurant starts as an investment opportunity first rather than serving great food. The decor is a cliche of what someone who has never been to the south thinks it all looks like. The food is unremarkable and service passable.

This is so much more than what you expect. Short story is in addition to the great bloody you get a garnish that include; bacon, celery, olives, pickles, deviled egg and a RIB. Yes a rib. So soo tasty. Give it a try and I guarantee you&#39;ll be taking pictures of your drink to show your friends and family. 

Lunch: brisket, hot links, burgers and tots. All good portion sizes and all good. The hot BBQ sauce has just enough heat and sweet. 

Service: Friendly but a bit slow."

This place reminds me of a Mexican restaurant here in Denver that people rave about because of their super strong margaritas with the food being an afterthought. We started with the prime rib egg rolls which were really good. Then came the rest of the dinner.
1. Baby back ribs, had very little flavor and were not helped by the flavorless BBQ sauce.
2. Pulled pork, was flavorless, and dry
3. Brisket was tender but had no flavor 
4. Hot link, hands down the worst I have ever had. Dry beyond dry, not even a hint of spice. Hard to describe a sausage being dry, flavorless, and tough.
5. Jambalaya, bland. 
Sides
Baked beans flavorful but mushy
Cornbread dry on top mushy/soggy on the bottom.
Drinks 
4 ice teas.
The food here, at least the BBQ, is pricey and mostly wavers between mediocre to not worth it.
Service was good and attentive. 
Not sure I would go back just for a good appetizer. A number of the reviews make mention of the bar, excellent drinks, etc. but anyone can draught a beer, or serve up some bourbon drinks. If the food is an afterthought and the bill comes to $100.00 before tip. I think I will be spending my money elsewhere."

Everything about this place is below grade chain.  The BBQ leaves a lot to be desired.  With nothing original here at all, which is rather disappointing.  The fried chicken.... Well this was the biggest let down.  If you&#39;ve had Kentucky fried chicken then you&#39;ve had Southern Hospitalities also.  Come on SH puts some Unique spice in or something. It was down right poor.  

With all this said the fried pickles weren&#39;t that bad and the only reason for the 2 star, oh and their happy hour prices aren&#39;t bad.

I ordered the 4pc chicken and waffles, and hubby had the 2 meat plate with brisket and a hot link.  My chicken and waffles were good but again, just good.  There was zero excitement in the dish.

We smoke our meats at home so we came with the hope to taste something a bit different.   And that&#39;s what we got. 

Food took forever to come out.    Brisket was cooked too fast which made it tough, fatty and tasteless. Spare ribs were merely ok.  Sausage links were good. Cross cut fries were hard , as if they were double fried.

The hostess was very nice and offered to take down our phone number and call if the crowd thinned out before our reservation.  We never got a call and showed up at 8:30 to find the parking lot was more empty and no one waiting for a table.  The same hostess led us to a table and I could see the scrap of paper with my phone number just laying on the hostess stand. Bonus points had to be subtracted.  Waitress nice and attentive. We used the buy 1 get 1 free beer yelp offer but had to wait for the second beer for 15 minutes due to changing of kegs. Sweet tea was nothing like southern sweet tea sadly. Ribs were good but as we are from Texas, the Memphis ribs came up short with tenderness and flavor. Brisket was good with a decent char.  Rocking tater tots are not rockin enough for the added cost as all it had was chives, shredded cheddar, and bacon...we were told there was a cheese sauce but none was on the tots.  Mashed potatoes were good and coleslaw decent but sadly fried chicken came up short.  It was tender and juicy, almost over cooked and the 2 piece came with a drumstick and breast.  I sadly have had better at kfc and it cost a lot less. The batter was thin and didn&#39;t stick properly to chicken. Felt like  chain bbq joint and I guess I like hole in the walls better."

Decent bark but most meat I got was dry and rub was caked on in some areas.  I had the brisket, pulled pork, and spare ribs.  Ribs were tuff and dry.  Brisket was tender for a slice or two then I got a few slices that were very dry and tuff.  Sat too long I think.  What was the most disappointing is the sides.  We got dirty rice, Mac n cheese, and collard greens.
Mac needs a new recipe, too much pepper, very bland cheese sauce they sprinkle some cheddar on top, very bland.  Dirty rice was terrible tasting again too peppery.  I like heat and it wasn&#39;t that hot it just didn&#39;t work the recipe needs an overhaul.  Collard greens with too much vinegar is a no no Period!"

Obviously, the 1st time was a positive enough experience to go again...

Appetizers: Both the Fried Pickles &amp; Fried Tomatoes were very good. The Prime Rib Egg Rolls--fantastic!

Entrees: Pulled Pork Sandwich and Pulled Brisket (meat only) were both well liked. Prime Rib? Given the price, I would&#39;ve expected considerably less fat (I expect some, yes, but this amount? NO) Although, probably even less liked was the smoked taste...I guess I&#39;m a Prime Rib snob &amp; prefer it to not have the flavor of ribs...

Sides: Tater Tots=good. Collards=Meh. Mashed Potatoes/Gravy=Very good.

The BIG winner? Get ready to write your obituary...

Dessert: Bourbon Bread Pudding is TO DIE FOR! It must be like crack, because now, I cannot even drive past the building w/o turning into a salivating Pavlov dog...Seriously folks, run an extra 3 miles, bike another 10...Do whatever it takes to justify this indulgence!

We went on Saturday afternoon not too busy which was perfect to get yo know a new place. I had the Makers Mark Mac n Cheese. To die for! The vegetables were not over cooked. The sausage was a great kick to the over all great taste. 
I had the banana pudding for dessert. So delicious.  It came in a little mason jar too. 

I only wished that the owner would have come out to talk to us. Get to know the locals a little more. 

We will be going back next weekend to try the breakfast."

They specialize in dry rub, which I wasn&#39;t too familiar with but now I&#39;m sold.  Seriously, these guys are awesome and their staff was super friendly, the way Southern Hospitality should be!  The place is urban-deco with simple murals on the walls.  Nothing kitschy, just simple &amp; clean.

  Here&#39;s a breakdown of my meal which I would highly recommend to anyone who asks.

Fired Pickles - the BEST I&#39;ve ever had!  Crispy and thick, the ideal snack to share with 2-4 people as it was a rather large plate.

Rocky Mountain Family Style Dinner - huge! About 6 servings of protein.  Dry rub ribs, brisket, and BBQ Chicken.  Sweet/smokey/a lil&#39; spicy. YUM!

Mac n&#39; cheese - not that creative or unique.  Could use some salt.

Tatar Tots - the yummiest ever!  Super crispy and freshly made.  Better than my childhood dreams of lunch time.

Banana Pudding desert -  Crunchy vanilla wafers in the bottom, creamy pudding (not too sweet), topped with whipped cream and banana slices.  Delightful ending to the meal.  

Also this place has 50+ types of Bourbon/Whiskey so if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into, I suggest you visit their bar.  I hardly drink anymore but got a Jack Daniels Peach Tea and I was glad I did!  It was a tasty drink but not too boozy.  A nice balance of &#34;oh yea, that&#39;s got a kick&#34; and &#34;MMM, sweet, spring afternoon tea.&#34;

Almost every &#34;southern&#34; restaurant blows me away with their biscuits. This place did not.  The biscuit was lukewarm at best, which I can deal with, but the sweet taste in the biscuit was so odd and just made the taste off putting.  
The restaurant itself had a neat look to it and the rest of the food wasn&#39;t bad, but sadly not memorable.  I will try it one more time I&#39;m sure to try the bread pudding and hopefully I&#39;ll have a slightly different experience, because the menu looks like it has a lot to offer."

We in the Southern burbs are sadly lacking in decent restaurants, so I was excited when I heard they were opening a SH here.  I am a fan of the one in downtown Denver, but hate having to deal with parking, etc, so this was nice.

I ate lunch here, and sat at the bar to eat. The bartender, Joseph, was incredibly friendly and made a lovely Mint Julep drink.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Tator Tots and the food was yummy and arrived quickly.  I hope this restaurant succeeds, as the previous 2 restaurants in this location have gone under."

The food is SO good and so fresh! They have a small menu with delicious staples - sandwiches, soups, salads, and more. They also have a seasonal menu with yummy finds! Today I had a salad off the seasonal menu. It was filled with mixed greens, squash, prosciutto, pears, and more! Yum! The portions are large and many dishes come with your choice of a side - all looked great!

They do serve beer, wine, and cocktails and would make a great spot for a casual date night. They have cucumber-infused tap water and lots of other tasty drinks.

They are in a small space with a darling patio out back that has a mix of small and large tables, bench seating, and heaters for chilly nights! Because it&#39;s so small it gets crowded and can have long waits. I came for lunch on a Monday and the place was full!

While sitting on their patio, I spotted their coffee shop&#39;s (next door) patio that looked darling - I can&#39;t wait to try it! Tip for WiFi users - they don&#39;t have WiFi."

The French banquette was soft and fresh with a perfectly crunchy outside. The meat was super tender and the BBQ sauce was fantastic. The curry chicken sandwich was just as phenomenal. The spices were very flavorful. Both sandwiches were so simple and light, but the high quality, fresh ingredients really make them satisfying. The coleslaw and the quinoa salad were both great and also tasted fresh and healthy. These sandwiches might be the best I have found in Denver. 

This place is tiny and seems to be constantly packed so finding a table is a nightmare and seating is very cramped. Prices are a little high but this won&#39;t stop me from coming back!"

We went here yesterday and I got a chicken curry sandwich and some thousand island potato salad. The sandwich was terrific, one of the better sandwiches I&#39;ve had in a while. Now the unfortunate part.

There was a hair in my potato salad. It was very long and it was pretty deep inside my food. I&#39;ve honestly never had this happen before so I didn&#39;t throw a fit, I just politely informed the staff and they gave me pasta salad instead.

Normally this warrants one or two stars but I do believe that the experience outside of that was great. I&#39;m not going to completely bash them for seemingly an honest mistake, I think they were unsure of what to do themselves. Regardless, this sort of thing shouldn&#39;t happen"

One should never judge the food based on the compact size of the kitchen and cafe.  Everything is made fresh using high quality ingredients from the market hence their daily market menu.  We visited this cute establishment after a great workout at Red Rocks in the morning.    

I decided on the vegan sandwich with sweet potato hummus, avocado and pickled winter vegetables.  My friend ordered the market fritatta with sweet potatoes, goat cheese.  We both marveled at how sweet and creamy the sweet potatoes were in our sandwich and fritatta!  The picketed vegetables added some nice crunch to the sandwich.  The portions are more than generous for one person.  I absolutely loved the red quinoa side salad with cranberries and nuts.  You usually get white quinoa in your salad but they stepped it up here and used red quinoa for a refreshing burst of color and texture!

The dining area is pretty cozy with just a few tables line the front of the cafe with a narrow walkway leading to a charming little outdoor patio.  After we stepped in, we&#39;re welcomed with a rather pungent aroma of burnt bacon, which lingered to the outdoor patio during the entire time we&#39;re there.  It was kind of hard to ignore despite the delicious food.  

This is no doubt a cozy neighborhood cafe with ridiculously fresh selection of sandwiches, salads and soups!  There is also a beverage and snack bar 2 doors down for quick grab and go options.  I can&#39;t wait to try the rest of their menu offerings in the future!"

They always have a few specials and the soups have been crave-worthy each time I&#39;ve ordered them. (Note to self - always order the soup at Vert.)

Their sandwiches are big.  Not Harry-Met-Sally big but too big for me to eat in a sitting.  Ideally, I&#39;d go with a sharing person...someone who would share a sandwich and 2 different soups.

When I didn&#39;t eat meat, this place was a favorite. Now that I&#39;ve re-joined the Dark Side, it&#39;s still a favorite."

The reviews weren&#39;t lying, Vert is TINY. But it sure packs a culinary punch. Thankfully we were able to snag the bar stool table because seats were going quickly! After perusing the menu I decided on the tuna sandwich with the slaw, my mom ordered the L&#39;Entrecôte (steak sandwich), and my dad ordered the curry chicken. 

Service was fast and friendly, and soon we were digging in. The tuna tasted fabulous; huge flakes that were not overly fishy but still retained the yummy fish flavor. The addition of greens tossed in some sort of vinaigrette and cucumber made it perfect! The slaw was good but I thought it had too much of a peanut taste to it. My mom loved the steak sandwich and my dad enjoyed his curry chicken which is similar to something we have at our local market :) 

Everything we ate tasted fresh and you can tell the employees take care when they prepare the food and place it on your plate. I love that they source locally and try to provide healthy, delicious food for the nearby residents (and the random tourist that wanders by :D) I would highly recommend Vert!"

The food there is always outstanding.  Tucked into a confined space, you can witness the artistry happening literally over the shoulder of the register employee.  

I ordered the braised pork shoulder sandwich, and it was fantastic.  The bbq sauce on the side to appreciate the flavor within the sandwich and adjust my need for sauce.  The pork was tender and flavorful, and the aioli was a great addition.  The hard french bread serves the much needed purpose to withstand the moist pork that laid within it.  Additionally, it soaked up the tangy bbq sauce as I occasionally dipped.  

As you are paying, you may notice the fresh salads, cookies, and the cheddar biscuits that appear scratch made.  So before you pay, and the hostess asks if you would like anything else, a reply of &#34;Yes&#34; would suffice.  Indicating that you would like everything else that they serve.

My 2 cents.  Cheers to the spunky artists working here and management for this fine establishment."

This is unfortunate, because I remember really liking it- maybe it&#39;s too convenient? Whatever, I didn&#39;t pretend to understand my weird motivations. 
Anyway, I ordered the Vegan de la Saison, which wasn&#39;t anything mind-blowing, from what I remember, there was hummus and cucumbers involved. I know it was a pleasant experience, though I don&#39;t honestly remember anything else about it, given to the fact that this was a good four or five month ago and my memory had been failing pretty much since birth. I did really like the potato salad side, although all of this was ordered to go and the portion size seemed comically tiny compared to the sandwiches.

I think the initial feeling walking in was that this place is legit. Looking at their menu we noticed that they have gluten free offerings. Although none of the extra fee incurred if you want yours that way. Coming from California I see that a lot. 

I had the BLT. I must go back and have this again. The bacon was thick and crunchy. They use the freshest ingredient and plates their sandwiches so beautifully. It&#39;s too pretty to eat:) with your order comes a choice of soup or salad. I had the quinoa. Well made with a good mix of sweet and savory courtesy of a few pieces of raisins. $12.

Sun drenched front area was my fist choice although we ended up in the back porch since Adam can&#39;t stand the heat. They&#39;re equally sweet spots but the back is cooler and a bit more romantic. 

So Vert in French means Green. Perfect description of the place. You feel that you&#39;re eating something healthy even if you&#39;re devouring a huge sandwich."

The seating arrangement was too small, cramped and unclean

Place was pretty empty.  Service was fine but they were out of baguettes so only bread choice was sourdough.  My spicy chicken sando was overflowing with raw serranos and cilantro and I can handle heat but the chiles just totally took over.  The chicken was good - obviously house roasted but I just didn&#39;t care for the combo at all.  Should have had a salad.  The accompanying ramekin of roasted tomato soup tasted like spaghetti sauce out of a jar - $20 with tip.  My friend also had a sando (curried chicken salad) that he though was OK and an odd gazpacho with strawberries in it and a side of tasteless slaw which he really didn&#39;t like.  With a glass of wine and tip his was almost $30.  Value proposition was way off - IMO.  Neither of us felt satisfied so off to Bonnie Brae for ice cream we went.  I think maybe they hit their stride mid-day - I wouldn&#39;t recommend going here for dinner.

Found an open table in the back patio to sit a group of 5 without any problems. Salad I ordered were really colorful and beautifully prepared and side of French bread was complimentary. Had a bite of my brother&#39;s curry chicken sandwich and my moms BLT. Hands down the BLT was the best choice. Bacon was thickly sliced and crunchy. Bread was awesome and the cheese spread on it was real delicious. Only reason I give it four instead of five stars was the curry chicken could have had a bit more zest and my salad was tasty but just lacking a little bit bland in flavor. All ingredients tasted really fresh though. Definitely would go back. The pecan cherry-chocolate chew was also worthwhile.

On to the food: the sandwiches here are mind-blowingly incredible. I don&#39;t understand how a sandwich that sounds so simple can be soo good. Less is more, I guess?!

I got the Vegan de la Saison with the quinoa salad on the side. The sandwich had avocados, strawberries, and arugula (from my fading memory). The combination of everything was impeccable. This sandwich is sweeter compared to the other ones, but oh-so tasty with just enough crunch from the bread and just enough flavor to make my tastebuds go for a whirl. (Yes, it was that awesome.)

My sister had the Tortilla Espanola, which was equally delicious with a perfectly cooked potato omelette within the sandwich. This one is not sweet like the Vegan de la Saison, so if you go with a friend and go switch half of your sandwiches (like I did with my sister), eat the not-as-sweet one first and sweeter one after!!

The quinoa salad was really good, too, with peas, raisins, and other good stuff, but I couldn&#39;t finish my sandwich or my quinoa salad so I boxed those babies up.

Overall, this place serves exceptional sandwiches and delicious sides for about $10-12 a piece. It may be on the pricer side, but you won&#39;t even know what happened at the register, once you take a bite."

It was filled with greens, asparagus, and prosciutto.  It was one of the best salad I&#39;ve ever had.  Asparagus was delicious and full of flavor.  Thicker slices of prosciutto which were salty and meaty.  The dressing was tangy which help balance the flavor.

I will be coming back to try a sandwich."

I came for lunch and got the House Roast Turkey sandwich, which comes with turkey, balsamic fig spread, chevre cheese spread, greens, and tomato on a roll. For the side I got a quinoa salad. I also picked up a cherry pecan cookie chew to go. 

The turkey sandwich really hit the spot and had a good amount of everything on it. I do wish it was bigger for $12, but it was satisfying nonetheless. The balsamic fig spread was so good that I had to make some myself when I got home. I highly recommend trying the turkey sandwich if you are in here. 

The quinoa salad was great as well. I typically don&#39;t like quinoa, but this place knows how to make it. It had greens, cucumbers, corn, blueberries, and something that added sweetness. This might sound like a strange hodgepodge of a salad, but it does magic in your mouth. Definitely get the quinoa salad.

The cherry pecan chew cookie was honestly not great for me. I know other people have posted that they love it, but not me. It looks great, like a circular, flattened chunky brownie. However, there is a bit too much chew for me as my jaw honestly got tired after a few bites trying to break down this cookie. The taste was also odd, not really chocolately, not really cherry or pecan flavored. It tasted sort of like undersweetened, overcooked brownies. But hey, that could just be me, or it could have been a bad batch, since other people love it. Either way, I do not recommend these chews. They have other desserts which look great though."

This is not hyperbole--everything is great to excellent. Sandwiches are always satisfying, but I often order soup. Vert puts twists on the familiar with such culinary expertise that I am addicted to this place, e.g. miso in their French onion or Szechaun pepper in their black bean soup. Soups are seasonal and change often. Plus ordering soups and sides keeps it a little cheaper (although the quality of food justifies the higher prices). I was there not too long ago, and everyone was going bonkers over the gazpacho.

Went for lunch and ordered their House Roast Turkey sandwich with a side of potato salad, and a Sun Tea. The patio seating had a very pleasant atmosphere, and the wait staff were attentive to the area - which I have found some small places with outdoor seating lack.

The potato salad was possibly some of the best I have ever tasted. There was a good balance of both flavors and textures - creamy, yet not too rich, and a good balance of large pieces of potato and &#34;binder&#34;, for lack of a better word.

As for the sandwich, the fig and the chèvre complimented one another splendidly, and the two added a good deal to an already decent sandwich - no shortage of roast turkey, and all folded into a crusty yet chewy French loaf.

The Sun Tea left something to be desired. While it was good tea, it was a small glass, and certainly not worth the $2.50 it was priced at.

Overall though, well worth a visit. Vert Kitchen wonderfully executes the balance of delicate and bold flavors that I have found to be characteristic of French cuisine."

He is constantly checking in on us to make sure if everything was good and if we didn&#39;t need anything else. 

We ordered the Croque Monsieur and a cup of hot Espresso and the taste was so great. It was so surprisingly good. We&#39;re so delighted with what they served and we enjoyed them.

YUMS:
* Curried Chicken Sandwich * This was my second choice as their popular Roasted Turkey Sandwich had sold out, but I would have seconds of this 2nd choice any day. Perfect flavor and all their sandwiches come with a side salad! I recommend the Thai Peanut Salad. Although judging from this one dish alone I recommend everything on their menu.

As such, I noticed that Denver restaurants don&#39;t have as many vegetarian options as other cities, but if that&#39;s their thing, I&#39;m the visitor, and I can certainly cope.

While that was the case for Vert Kitchen, that&#39;s not the reason for my two star review. The place looks great, and the food that I was able to eat was good, but the service and attention to detail was lacking.

Back to my finicky eating habits and diverting blame from myself...Seeing no real veg. options, I asked the guy taking orders if they could whip together a &#34;big salad&#34; (a la Elaine Benes) without any meat or beans. The guy seemed pretty accommodating and didn&#39;t seem annoyed by my admittedly somewhat annoying order. He said no problem and said the guys in back would throw something together with greens and whatever veg and fruit they had on hand. Sounds great! 

However, when I got home...I had a side-sized little salad with some greens, veg, and fruit, but also full of garbanzo beans. While it didn&#39;t have meat, I had three requests (no meat, no beans, and &#34;big&#34;) and they only met one.

The cashier even gave me an extra chocolate chip cookie with a big smile which (almost ironically) scored major brownie points with me because I love me some chocolate chip cookies.

If I had to recommend one thing to improve my experience, it might be to invest in some fans for the back patio. It was well shaded but there&#39;s not a lot of breeze coming through so in the 12-1pm time I was getting pretty toasty (but that may just be me).

We went on a Wednesday evening and had the frittata of the day which came on a beautiful salad of greens and strawberries, apples and radishes. It was delicious. We also got the vegetarian sandwich that has cheese and potatoes (I forgot the name) and the beer and Brie soup. 

That. 
Soup.

Go now and get it. Both my husband and I don&#39;t usually go for beer cheese soup but ordered it due to the guy behind the counters suggestion. It was so creamy and full of flavor. We both said we would drive back across Denver to have that soup again. Everything we had was so yummy and artfully prepared with every color of the rainbow. 

The restaurant is small with only about 6-7 2 person tables but the decor is French market inspired and very quaint. Our overall experience was excellent."

Place: It  is small.  We came early for lunch and barely got a spot.  It is not family friendly.   There is only one bathroom.  People who came after us had to take their food to go.

Costs:  Expensive for what they offered.  Especially the can drinks?  This place would have been better if they made those drinks themselves

Service:  Horrible.  In addition to the expensive food, they want tip on top of that?  What services were they giving to deserve tips?  There is one thing I hate are places that don&#39;t provide full service yet has a tip line.  The only thing they do is wipe down your table when you leave(McDonald does that too and so does Atlanta Bread).  

Food:  Above average but not excellent."

Seeing as Vert is supposed to have some of the best sandwiches in Denver, we thought we&#39;d better check things out. 

Our to go included a turkey, blt&#39;s, chicken curry, steak and a tortilla espanola. Mine was the tortilla espanola and I found it to be on amazing bread but lacking in a bit of seasoning. I would have loved more manchego cheese and aoli. 

The rest of the team enjoyed their sandwiches. We also ordered raspberry lemonade which was advertised as fresh squeezed. My boss didn&#39;t think it tasted like it and I thought it was a little weak. 

The most amazing part of my meal was by far the fleur de sal cookie. It was magical and I jumped up and down like a little kid on a pogo stick. So amazing. The brown butter rice crispie treat was also pretty ridiculous good. And the chocolate chip cookies. 

The rest of the menu absolutely looks worth exploring!"

The Curry Chicken was delicious. The apples and cashews added a nice crunch, and the curry was very flavorful. But as good as that was, the L&#39;entrecote was the star of the show IMO. The steak was delicious, and the vinaigrette mixed with the arugula added the perfect amount of acidity in the sandwich. I enjoyed every bite.

The restaurant itself was nice and airy - windows thrown open, a few seats outside by the street to sit down and eat, along with some inside - gave it a very casual, friendly, and open feel. It had a very sleepy feel to it on a weekday morning in the summer (perhaps a bit more lively when the school across the street is in session), but the ladies at the front were very friendly in helping us with our order, as well as recommending which sandwiches would keep better if we weren&#39;t planning on eating right away. We ended going with the turkey and skirt steak sandwiches, as well as a couple of the included salads (I went with the pasta salad, while my wife had the quinoa).

Perhaps it&#39;s because we were exhausted and were pretty hungry, but I think it&#39;s more likely that the sandwiches here are phenomenal. While turkey can be a banal sandwich option at times, the house-roasted turkey is the real stuff (not the deli-sliced version), and it&#39;s very juicy and succulent. I really liked the hint of acidic sweetness that the figs dipped in balsamic gave the meat, and it was overall a very delicious choice. My skirt steak sandwich was a bit on the tougher side - it was tough to get a bite without eating a whole slice of the steak. However, the meat was really well-flavored, and the mustard gave each bite a nice little tang to it. The side salads were both really good; my pasta salad was solid - not overly heavy but with a good amount of cheese mixed in. The quinoa salad was really nice and clean, with some berries mixed in to give it a subtly sweet undertone. I had the lemonade, which was quite refreshing without being sugary by any means. For dessert (which, admittedly, we ate first), my wife grabbed a brown sugar (or was it brown rice?) house-made Rice Krispy imitation, which was toned down on the sweetness front but had a nice mix of earthy sweetness to it - almost like you were eating a healthy dessert that you wouldn&#39;t reprimand yourself over later.

While the sandwiches are a bit on the pricey side, the quality is excellent and well worth it for what I think is a reasonably affordable lunch experience. If you&#39;re planning on hiking to the west/southwest of Denver, this is a great stop to pick up food. And if you want to sit down, it&#39;s got a great casual vibe to it that makes it an enjoyable place to stop by."

The food is absolutely delicious! I am not normally a fan of sandwich places, mostly because it seems senseless to order a sandwich when usually you can make one the way you like, however, I tried this place on a friend&#39;s reccomendation. 

Not feeling particularly exotic, I ordered the BLT. With a side of what I originally thought to be couscous, but ended up being something else (sorry forgot the name) mixed with greens and raisins. When the sandwich came out, I was surprised at the size of it. It was perfect amount to fill a person who eats a sizeable amount during one sitting. 

The only con I could possibly imagine for the restaurant would be space. All seating was a lol too close for my taste. They do have an outdoor area for seating, which is a bit more spacious."

Besides the cookies, there are a ton of great other options. So far I&#39;ve enjoyed the BLT, which has bacon that is as thick as a 2x4. Also had the croque monseur which I&#39;m sure was 10,000 calories, but worth every bite. Opt for the egg on top of the salad, it will change your ability to love. On top of that, two cookies both delicious and eligible to cause the insanity plea if I were to do anything crazy.

On top of all of that, the people are great! They are friendly, with extremely quick service even with the wonderful display of food. If you get a chance, check out that bathroom too.

I&#39;m from California, and I am all about hole in the wall, taquerias. Mom and pop joints cooking up righteous tacos. From San Francisco to San Diego, I&#39;ve eaten a lot of tacos. Since coming to Colorado, I&#39;ve found some good, albeit hipster places. 

But THIS is the flavor I&#39;ve been looking for. They really get it right on all points...flavor, texture and price. They serve street taco style, simple but easy to overthink. Crisp carnitas, grilled brisket meat that&#39;s more tender than carne asada, well marinated pastor and the surprise was the chicken that had the skin on for a nice crunch. And the mini corn tortillas, just perfect. Soft and melt in your mouth. Not an afterthought but fully integrated into the experience. 

We also got free chips and salsa to start, and the salsa was crazy good. Fresh made, a little spice, very smoky. If they bottled it, I would&#39;ve bought 2. 

Ambience is nothing to speak of, but clean and comfortable. Definitely not hipster in any way. And price? We paid $17 for 6 amazing tacos and a soda. Go to some of the more mainstream places and you&#39;ll pay double or triple. Incredible value. 

We will be back to sample everything!"

We do not have very good Mexican food. We do have a couple of decent taco places here and there, but we are still left wondering how authentic Mexican food really tastes. Well, people.... this is the closest that I have found!! So, come one, and come all!! This place is THE definition of hole in the wall. Can&#39;t find it after driving around the block three times? Check. Next to a gas station? Check. Can&#39;t figure out which door leads to the restaurant? Check. Luckily there is a small &#34;public parking lot&#34; off of Floyd Ave, so save yourself some drive time and just park there and walk toward the Conoco. Go to the end of the building and you will find this unicorn of a restaurant. 

Once you walk in, it is actually a little bigger than it looks. There is a slightly larger room to the left for bigger parties, but there was only 3 of us, so we sat right next to the counter. The woman (also owner) there is the sweetest lady and pretty much does all the serving herself, so be patient.  I ordered the horchata, and my friend ordered tamarindo to drink, both were very refreshing and legit. We ended up ordering Huaraches, Quekas and Mixiotes. None of which I have ever had before, but all were SO flavorful and tender. Huaraches was my favorite dish and it had a grilled cactus base, choice of meat, tomato, onions, avocado and topped with cheese. Very light and delicious. Quekas is basically a quesadilla, and then Mixiotes was chicken that was seasoned with chili peppers, cumin, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and garlic (and probably many other seasonings) and it was served with beans and rice. Everything we had was fresh and home made, you will not be disappointed no matter what you order. This little restaurant impressed me more than many, many other restaurants I have tried. I will definitely be back for more."

I ordered burrito al pastor so funky unbelievably tasty. I came back a second time and ordered tacos carnitas fabulous. They actually make spicy authentic salsas and don&#39;t tone it down for gringos. What&#39;s funny is that it&#39;s next to a gas station. Go to this restaurant don&#39;t be afraid.

Growing up in Southern California I got a lot of good Mexican food. This is legit Mexican food. Simple and fantastic. The place is easy to miss (gas station?) but worth finding. Get the street tacos. If you&#39;ve been to Mexico and fallen in love with real Mexican tacos you need to go to this place. You&#39;ll be rightfully pleased.

I haven&#39;t eaten at all of them, but my wife and I stopped in for dinner at Garibaldi, and they&#39;re doing it right.

I had the chili relleno, and it was good, but my wife&#39;s burrito really stole the show. Our meal opened with the obligatory chips and salsa. Here, I&#39;ll point out that everything at Garibaldi is made fresh. The salsa had a decent kick to it, but it didn&#39;t hurt my gringo palate (or my wife&#39;s). 

Everything at Garibaldi was plated beautifully. Truly, we eat with our eyes. Don&#39;t judge this restaurant because of its odd location. Go inside, order something, and see the art that comes out of the kitchen. As an added bonus, it tastes good, too.

My wife and I finished our meals with the house-made churros and an order or chocolate flan cake that was also house-made. We chatted with the young owner throughout our meal. It&#39;s exciting to see someone who&#39;s so enthusiastic about his craft. The chocolate flan cake was on the house - I suppose he enjoyed the conversation, too.

I inquired about the name Garibaldi because it seemed to be an odd name for a mexican restaurant. Garibaldi is the name of a large market in Mexico City, and the owner&#39;s concept is to serve Mexico City style Mexican food. There are a couple of non-traditional items on the menu, though; demand for those items is just too high for him to ignore.

This was one of the best, most personal experiences we&#39;ve had in a restaurant for a while. Choose Garibaldi for personal service, delicious, fresh-made food, and excellent plating."

Truly home cooked Mexican food. Clean &amp; tidy. Hard to see from the street....just park your car offside at the station &amp; walk toward the gas pumps and you will see it at the center of the station. Or park next door in the small free city parking lot at the NE corner of Floyd &amp; S. Broadway if there&#39;s no space at the station. You can get your tire repaired just outside, an oil change and a car wash as well. Gives new meaning to &#34;fill &#39;er up.&#34; and multi-tasking.

We enjoyed the wing place that used to be there (we live down the block), so when Garibaldi&#39;s moved in, we had to try it. 

I can&#39;t recommend this place enough! Forget that it&#39;s right next to a gas station, for some reason this unsettles people. But it&#39;s incredibly clean, the service is always quick and the food is authentic and amazing!! 

They serve Mexico City style Mexican food so it&#39;s as authentic as it gets. Things can get a bit spicy! 
I always recommend their street tacos to start off. They&#39;re only $1.80 each and about three of them fill me up!! They have four different kinds but I always somehow go back to the brisket tacos, which never fail. If you prefer something heartier, their smothered burritos are massive and you&#39;ll probably need a take-home box.

When you&#39;re done with your entrées, you MUST order the Tres Leches for dessert! I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I can&#39;t help but get this every time. It&#39;s perfectly moist and not overwhelmingly sweet, I honestly hate sharing it! 

I have ZERO complaints about this place. Service is always quick and friendly. Food is always delicious, and best of all, it&#39;s down the block. But I would travel across Denver just for this place. Do not pass this up!"

The chorizo (made in house) taco was damn good and the pastor taco wasn&#39;t too shabby.   This place is literally tucked in a Conoco gas station.  Tacos were $1.80 a piece, so happy with my sub $6 cinco de mayo dinner.

My wife and I ordered a slice of the key lime pie, apple pie, and coconut pie. Order total came out to about $12. The key lime pie and coconut pit both had a ton of whipped cream on top. About 3/4th of the pie was just whipped cream. The actual pie part was about half an inch tall. Taste wise it wasn&#39;t bad. Tasted how it was supposed to taste. Nothing spectacular or memorable.

Service wise it took them a really long time to notice we were standing there waiting. A clearly intoxicated gentleman was standing next to us waiting to be seated and started to chat with us. I wanted my pie so I could leave, but they took their time getting it."

First walking in, seems like its run by teenagers. The staff seemed to disagree a lot on who&#39;s job belongs to who. They stated that they would seat us in an area that had just been occupied by kids so it was messier than usual. When we got to our table, there was still trash on the seats and on the table but that wasn&#39;t too big of a deal, not like it will suddenly jump into our food or something. 

I ordered the patty melt, I have not had one since I was in high school working as a chef in a similar style restaurant (the irony). It was very good, exactly like how I remembered them to be. My wife got the chicken fried chicken. confusing at first but then you find out (gasp) they put gravy on fried chicken, who woulda thunkit.

I do like that I can make my own breakfast from the VIB menu and that I can get a burger at 9 am if I want it.  Hey! who said breakfast had to be eggs and bacon???

On the positive side the staff have always been friendly and helpful.  Service is pretty good and some can be quite conversational too, mostly those in the middle age range.

We ordered the eggs benedict and chicken fried steak, plus an iced mocha.  The chicken friend steak was very average and previously frozen ie not fresh, so it wasn&#39;t great but it wasn&#39;t awful.  The eggs benedict was a little better, eggs cooked ok, bacon alright but the hollandaise sauce looked as though it would light up the room if the electricity went out - quite chemically looking.  The iced mocha tasted like dish water.

With Village Inn food there is very little imagination, you get what the corporation thinks its customers want to eat, in the look of the meal too.

The pie&#39;s I don&#39;t like at all.  There is nothing delicate about them, they have no finesse.  There is too much in the pie, so large when I look at them that puts me off a little.  They are also fairly sweet compared to European equivalent, which I am more used to, maybe the market here like buckets of sugar or an ocean of whipped cream on them - but it doesn&#39;t really work for me.

We may have had some bad luck but whenever we have been here the clients have been fairly aggressive and disturbed other people&#39;s meals plus the ambience of the place.  We had to be asked to move to another table.

Don&#39;t think I will come back any time soon, maybe in a few years when I get that urge again."

Told him yeah I was excited cuz my wife was sick and it forced her to stay home today, which meant we were going to watch the game live-normally have to watch it late when she gets home. Next thing I know he&#39;s handing me a free pie to try and make her feel better!!! Thank you Tim!

The portions were really small. The food wasn&#39;t great. Fake potatoes, gravy was jelly-esk, lettuce wilted, bread stuck in the gravy and grease and soggy. Since when does VI&#39;s prices get to compete with Olive Garden or Texas Roadhouse? You only get to have higher prices with higher quality, right? We were there for 15 minutes before we got drinks, our server didn&#39;t check on us for at least 20 minutes after we got our food from a runner. We were missing pancakes and needed hot sauce. My daughter would not eat her food without it. At this point, my husband was finished eating and I was close. She brought me black pancakes, forgot the sauce and rushed off. After eating, we waited another 15 minutes or so, wanting pie to go. We were giving up and going to the register when she showed back up and then it took another 10 minutes for that. Really, not impressed this time around."

My husband and I rolled in here for a late night dinner (~10:30 pm).  We had been studying and working all day and our eating schedule was completely out of whack.  We were also starving, and wanted something quick and close to home.  At this time of night, there weren&#39;t many patrons, so our service was super quick.  Our waitress was remarkably perky for that time of night.  Impressive.  By comparison, we must have looked tired and sullen.

Fortunately, our food arrived rapidly (two omelets with included two small stacks of pancakes).  The omelets were fluffy, not overcooked, and filled with fresh veggies.  The pancakes were also fluffy.  Not the fluffiest I&#39;ve had, but pretty fluffy.  (Why was I obsessed with fluffiness?  I must have been thinking of the fluffy pillow I was going to pass out on after dinner).  ;)

The fruit cup was a bit lackluster (some not-so-sweet watermelon, grapes, and pineapple), but it&#39;s a Village Inn.  I won&#39;t hold it against them too much.

I liked the quirky, colorful, 1950s-influenced decor.  Colorful, pastel stripes and some antique-y touches from the era added a touch of fun.

After living in Aurora for over a year and a half, I&#39;m surprised we haven&#39;t stopped here before.  Now that we know what the quality of food is, we&#39;ll likely be back for other late-night, oh-god-I-forgot-to-eat-and-look-at-the-time outings."

The more options you give me, the happier I am! Village inn has numerous breakfast options and combinations at a really good price. Their advertising and brochures are amazing, and ultimately what brought me there for breakfast. It was one of the worst places I&#39;ve been to - the eggs Benedict&#39;s smelled rancid, the sauce was curdled and the bacon was stale. The table wasn&#39;t wiped down before we sat down and we had no napkins brought to us until well into our meal even though we asked more than once. Refills were impossible because nobody came around to check on us, and the pancakes (3 the size of my palm) were lacking compared to everywhere else I&#39;ve had breakfast. I won&#39;t be going back.

We arrived at about 7pm on a Saturday evening.  We were greeted fairly promptly and given an option of seating which was the beginning and the end of our positive experience here.  I wanted to give this place 2 stars but when I rehashed the experience I just couldn&#39;t put into words why they would deserve it.  

We both ordered water to drink which took forever to come to the table.  Then we placed our dinner order which took almost an hour for two people, and even then they didn&#39;t bring out the full order.  He had ordered a combo with an extra side of chicken and he only received one of the meats.  The chicken came just in time as I was finishing my meal and his catfish never came so we received it to go when we got the bill. In addition,  his bread was ordered as a roll but he got cornbread.  My chicken was dry and the sides were not authentic.  

Bottom line,  I could have saved myself some time and money by just going to KFC down the street."

Ultimately, I was just disappointed. 

I got the pulled pork meal with fried okra and Mac and cheese and an order of hush puppies. 

Everything that was fried was delicious. It came out hot and was perfectly crunchy. 

The pulled pork was swimming in barbecue sauce. I know there are varying opinions on pulled pork but I&#39;m a &#34;less is more&#34; person on the sauce. I felt like they were trying to use up odds and ends instead of featuring a delicious sandwich. 

The Mac and cheese was definitely creamy but it had that fake cheese taste. 

Lunch didn&#39;t seem like a popular time so I got the impression that everything that could sit for a while did. 

I think I&#39;ll come back. The service, sweet tea and fried okra were excellent. Next time I think I&#39;ll stick to the fried options."

I used to live a mile from the COLORADO location but never made. Today I drove 17 mikes to the new location and was disappointed. Two stars for the fried chicken breast. It was fried perfectly and juicy all the way through. Sides leave much to be desired. Mac and cheese was a bowl of mushy noodles. You could not even see an entire whole noodle. Cheese sauce had no flavor. It was definitely not made today. Collards were better but did not have any southern flair, like ham hock. Black eyed peas the same. No flavor. Tasted like they were straight from the can. Hush puppies were too dense. Fried okra was a healthy version of fried, barely battered and pan fried.  And cream for the coffee was a cup of dairy (?) powder. Asked for milk, they did not have any.  My suggestion is to stick to the fried meats and forget everything else."

We absolutely loved almost everything, except the burgers.  The fish fillet is huge and seasoned and fried to perfection, we even ordered a file to go.  The poo chop and mashed potatoes were mouth watering, so so good!  The cabbage which can be prepared so many ways, and still not right, was perfect!  I believe the burger could have been better with a different bun and the fries along with the wing could have been a little more crisp.

The catfish was overdone, extremely tough, especially the ends. The pork chop wasn&#39;t seasoned well, and it was SOOOOO DRY! My hunny had a pig ear on the side that he said was decent. Also, the Mac and cheese is most certainly not homemade; bummer because not only is it not homemade, but it&#39;s not very good. The collard greens were excellent, though.

We had a table of 4 and were seated at one of the nice large round tables. We started off with a couple sides of hushpuppies because they&#39;re quite tasty and hard to find out here.

We ordered our food and waited a good long while. The orders weren&#39;t exactly right, but we aren&#39;t a picky bunch so we still chowed down on the fried chicken and fantastic sides. It&#39;s some of the better fired chicken I&#39;ve had in a long time. The mashed potatoes and mac n&#39; cheese were also really good. 

Our server was a very nice guy and tried extremely hard, even though he messed up a few things on the orders and the check, but we had a good time and the food was great so we didn&#39;t mind. 

The prices are very reasonable, just plan at least an hour, because like anything good food takes time to make, and you&#39;re in a southern style restaurant, and down south dinner usually lasts an hour or two as well."

My roots are in Louisiana so I get the cravings every so often but haven&#39;t been to a soul food theme place in Denver. I go by word of mouth for these types of things and was recommended to come here. 

You walk in and it&#39;s like a super comfy house. It&#39;s almost as if a bible study class was in session. Quiet and comfortable, comfortable and more comfortable. It&#39;s an &#34;Itis&#34; inducing environment for sure. Family friendly too. 

I made out with the fried catfish/chicken combo with collard greens and Mac n cheese. My only thing is that this time the Mac and cheese was a little runny but the greens were good and had chunks of turkey. The side dishes come in pretty small dishes. Catfish was crispy and chicken was fried uniquely. Sweet tea I had was good and they have a kool- aide option.

Let&#39;s talk about the setting. Not in the best area at all. The actual restaurant is not pretty at all. The parking is terrible. With those things said, I don&#39;t care.  It&#39;s a soul food place and the setting matches the style of food. 

The service is great as said above. The people are friendly and the place is small and intimate to accentuate the service even more.  

The food:  here is where the gem is. Like I&#39;ve said I&#39;ve been there several times and never been disappointed. He collard greens are the best I&#39;ve ever had and the catfish is world class.

I ordered the fried chicken with Mac and Cheese and Fried Okra. She ordered the porchops, one smothered, one not smothered, with sides of Black Eyed Peas and collard greens. 

Fried Chicken: I thought it was really good. The skin was seasoned great and tasted great. My friend thought that maybe they cook the chicken in the same vat as the fish, because she could taste some fishiness to the skin. 

Mac and Cheese: Terrible. It really just had no flavor. 

Okra: Decent, but standard

Smothered Pork Chop: Flavor was really good, but the porkchop was almost all bone. 

Pork Chop: Very good

Black Eyed Peas: Very very very salty. 

Collard Greens: We both thought these were the best part of the meal. They were very good.

First off, we were told that they didn&#39;t have any red kool-aid...okay. No cornbread...okay. No candied yams...not okay but we wanted to patron the business so decided to stay. 

We waited 45 minutes for pigs feet &amp; pig ears (restaurant was not crowded). These items are pre cooked but oddly, we waited patiently anyway. 

When the food finally got there, she (the owner) had taken my cousin&#39;s order wrong so instead of 2 pig feet, she got 2 pig ear sandwiches. My plate had not yet come. I&#39;m getting upset now. 

I get my plate with 1 disintegrated pig foot, the 2nd not quite cooked enough with a big, fat, hairy patch on it! Freakin gross! 

Macaroni &amp; cheese had a tangy, lemon type flavor...not okay. Sent back! Greens were cooked just right but way too daggone salty. Now I&#39;m salty about this whole fiasco because I&#39;ve been overly patient with my hour plus visit (And I&#39;m still hungry). Then I realize that I don&#39;t even have my hush puppies. Okay, I&#39;M DONE! 

To the owner: I understand you all were very busy before we arrived (it was 12:30 p.m.) &amp; that this was the reason you ran out of so much food, but you could have come over to the table&amp;asked what the problem was, like a caring woman&amp;business owner. You could have tried to offer an answer to the problem but instead, you took the low road. As you walked by ACROSS the room, you turned to me &amp; said, &#34;I told her (the waitress) not to charge you &amp; kept going. Wow! Really!  Not cool &amp; it was not anyone else&#39;s (other customer&#39;s) business what was going on@our table. The worst part was the expression on your face.

I have been a customer for 6 years, long before your television appearance &amp; you were always very sweet. Don&#39;t let exposure &amp; extra customers take you somewhere ugly. I was a customer when the seats were not so full.

The people that work at this restaurant are always extremely welcoming and accommodating.

I have been for five times, gotten multiple items, and everything has been just as you&#39;d hope it would be.

Everything from the decor, to the people working there, to the delicious food, gives me the feeling of sitting in my grandmothers house and having her delicious Southern food.

What I really especially liked here was the fried catfish. When done badly, fried catfish is the worst. However, done right with a crispy, flaky breading, it&#39;s the best. They totally nail it."

I&#39;m from West Virginia and I miss southern food and hospitality; I got my fix here. I really don&#39;t like catfish but for some reason I keep trying to make it fit . Cora Fayes was up to the challenge. The fried catfish was excellent and my kids devoured their food. Our service was wonderful and full of heart. Our server was just so sweet and put her whole personality into what she did for us. After our delicious meal Miss Patricia came out and spoke with us for quite a while. It really helped to top off the whole great experience of eating here. Needless to say we left with full satisfied stomachs and a couple of hugs to go. This soul food is served with love.

1st trip, great food great service. Met the owner, chatted about the history of the place.. Great time. Was excited about coming back.

(update) 25 minutes no food.

2nd trip, got here at 5:40 as they close at 7. 2 more 2-tops came in after us (20 minutes or so) and both ordered before we did.  We got out drink orders in and they got their food. 20 minutes later (almost an hour in) we are told they are out of most food as the other tables got the last chicken. Finally got food at 7 and were informed they were closing. They didn&#39;t tell us to hurry up..but it was implied.

(update) 30 minutes... No food. This is lunch.. Not the dinner rush..

35 minutes. When do I walk?

40 minutes. No one has come by my table in more than. 20 minutes.

42 minutes. Food is here. Looks wonderful.

I thought it was just great that they were moving to my neck of the woods, Aurora, So yesterday, I went with my CNA and we were going to have lunch.. OMG what a disappointment that was!  I don&#39;t know if they have a new cook or what but they need to get rid of him or her. There wasn&#39;t a lot of people in there when we went, so I figured that it wouldn&#39;t take too long for our meals to arrive. My CNA ordered the Catfish with the black eyed peas and I ordered the Smothered Pork Chop with candied yams and black eye peas and corn bread. We both had lemonade to drink. Well when our meals arrived the disappointment set in. My CNA &#39;s plate had hair all over the top of her fish and the plate was dirty and my pork chops were so tough that the knife wouldn&#39;t cut through them, I did manage to eat 1/2 of 1 of them pork chops (took the other 1 1/2 home), the candied sweet potatoes were really good, but the black eyed peas were so full of salt that I drink my lemonade down and ate the ice cause it was horrible(specially for a person who doesn&#39;t salt her food). Anyhow the person who looked like the one on TV with Guy Ferro(Diners Drive-in and Dives) came to our table and we told her about my CNA&#39;s plate and they asked if she wanted something else and she said she lost her appetite after seeing all that hair and dirty plate. So I ate the sweet potato&#39;s and thought, lets have some dessert and I will take the rest of my plate home. So the waitress came and asked us if we wanted anything else, and also said they took my CNA&#39;s lunch off the check and I said I would like dessert.. She says they had No Dessert today, I looked at her and said, What, you had some good desserts at the other one in Denver, why not here, and she said they didn&#39;t make any. I figured since they are closed on Mondays they would have all kinds of goodies, like their sweet potato pie or there banana pudding that was always good at the Denver Restaurant. Well I was very disappointed and sort of embarrassed too since I suggest we go there and my CNA didn&#39;t get to eat and I was still hungry when I left.. Well last night I paid for eating that tough pork chop and those salty peas, between having stomach problems and being on the toilet most of the night, I was sick. I felt fine after all the food was out of me, but I also felt sorry for whomever is going to be reading this. You need a new cook, smothered pork chops need to be cooked all day to be fork tender,  it would of been better if it was cooked longer, black eyed peas should never had so much salt on them, most dining places don&#39;t salt there food anymore because of high blood pressure and so they let the customers salt their food and the yams should of been in a separate little dish so that it wouldn&#39;t of been mixed in with the gravy and rice mixture.. Rice in smothered pork(never heard of it)but hey Im only the customer. Other than that the Lemonade was good(but wish I had the kool-aide instead). I will wait for a couple of months and go back around the holidays, call ahead and see what they have to eat and make sure they have dessert!!  But for now, I will stick with cooking my smothered pork chops at home since its a all day process."

This is a small place over in the City Park area.  It is unassuming and easy to miss, but look for it and turn around if you have to, it is totally worth it!

I love small family run restaurants where the owners pour their heart and soul into the food, where they are sharing awesome family recipes, where they come out to the dining room and say &#39;hello&#39; and &#39;thank you for dining with us&#39;.  You will get all that plus a cozy dining room that reminds you of being at your grandma&#39;s house (even though my grandma did not cook southern food)

We have tried Cora Faye&#39;s a couple times and loved every bite.  The fried chicken and fish are so perfectly crispy and not too greasy.  The sides... collard greens, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, fried okra... all amazing!!  

And don&#39;t forget to check the daily specials.  My BF loves the neck bones over rice and gravy... not so much my thing.  But, I will not pass up the smothered rabbit (Sundays only... I think)

The atmosphere is quaint, with articles written about the food and old advertisements of CoraFaye&#39;s decorating the walls.  Soul music plays in the background.

I ordered the jumbo friend chicken breast with sides of hushpuppies, mac and cheese, and candied yams.  Pretty much a coronary on a plate, but it&#39;ll be worth the medical bill later on.  The hushpuppies especially were perfectly crisp and had just the right amount of onion.

Unfortunately, our service didn&#39;t match how good the food was.  Somehow our ticket got lost, so our food had a major delay.  We were given some free desserts to make up for it, which was very nice, but our service didn&#39;t get any better (no water refills, took a long time to cash out)."

I enjoyed meeting and talking with the proprietress (sp?) about the food and about her vintage books and antiques.   

The old friend had eaten here prior,  but my daughter and I hadn&#39;t.  What a delight it was.  

My friend ordered the fried catfish with 2 sides and hush puppies,  and my daughter and I shared the 4-sides plate.   Our share was more than enough for both of us.  All of us also tried bits of each other&#39;s sides.  Love the greens,  okra,  mashed potatoes, yams,  and cornbread---a lot!   My daughter and friend loved the catfish too.  

Also I adore the comfortable down-home feeling here....in my old neighborhood,  where I went to elementary school.   Structurally,  looking out the window,  the buildings looked the same as they used to on this block.  So much of the infrastructure of Denver has changed over the years...it is nice to see a block that looks structurally the same as it always did.    Of course change can be a lovely thing,   but in Denver it is so grounding for me to see familiar sights.

Of course,  CoraFaye&#39;s was not around during my youth,  but if it had been I would have adored it.   I just know it.

It&#39;s the classics done right! I had ordered the Catfish Dinner with a side of cabbage and macaroni and cheese. It was exactly the comfort style cooking my mom used to make which in my opinion is the best compliment to give a chef!

Catfish- Nice sized filets with no muddy flavor which is common when people fry pre-frozen pieces in old oil. This fish was fried golden brown, extra crispy, and served piping hot at my table. I loved that it wasn&#39;t heavily seasoned,  or over salted in the batter. A squirt of fresh lemon and hot sauce and I was in heaven!!

Macaroni n Cheese- Creamy pasta, nice flavor, seasoned well. No need for anything extra- It was good!

Cabbage- Good, not great. Missed the bacon pieces or vinegar to give it more punch. 

SOUL FOOD EGG ROLLS- Whomever came up with this concept is freaking GENIUS!! Smothered chicken deep fried in the crispy wonton paper was soo good I wish they offered these as an entree instead of an appetizer! Highly recommend you try any one of those! Best surprise at a soul food spot to date!!

Service- Came in with the family an hour prior to closing time and we were still served fresh, piping hot food with a smile! I never got the impression that we were being rushed to eat so they could close up and my family enjoyed our dinner in the quiet dining area that looks like grandma&#39;s kitchen!

When you walk in the place look like a hodge podge of several different thrift store ventures, mix of religious knick knacks from the ethnic catalogs that sale bible stuff. Cute theme but it was overbroad for my taste, was scared to sit down. Ms. CoraFaye was nice along with the family members working that night, the were so excited to help and explain the history of the restaurant. She brought out samples of her new venture of Soul Food Egg Rolls, thought it was a good idea until we tasted it. Sad to say only one that was good was the Sweet Potatoes Egg Roll. Knowing how to cook, along with having southern roots, I was truly insulted by the food that was presented. The gravy tasted like the prepackaged mixes with NO flare added to cover the powdery taste. The rice and black eye peas needed to be cooked longer, the greens without the hot sauce were bland and a little under cooked. If this is a representation of soul food, then the heart and flare is missing from the chef. THIS IS NOT SOUL FOOD IT&#39;S CAFETERIA FOOD, nasty Furrs and County Buffet soul food taste better than this place.

It was so highly praised and recommended before I ate here, and the claim was that Cora Faye&#39;s had great soul food and really good fried chicken. However, most all of the food is under salted and bland. The only thing we had from Cora Faye&#39;s that was actually good was the fried okra, and I do love me some good fried okra, but absolutely nothing else we had, fried chicken, fried catfish, etc, had any real flavor to it. 

This was my first representation of soul food in the Denver area and I have to say that I was highly let down.

If this is what people in Denver consider to be good soul food and good fried food, then IDK how long I can live in a location where the residents have absolutely no palate. This place was a complete disappointment, and probably the worst soul food that I&#39;ve had in my life. A life that has included living in about 10 different states, and, somehow, Cora Faye&#39;s tops the list of the worst soul food establishments. Real sad. Get your crap together, Denver."

My husband and I have been once and then I promptly took my brother back. I don&#39;t think anything here is not good, but the fried chicken is a must. 

I will say that I&#39;m not a fan of the mac and cheese here, however, which is shocking because I would mainline mac and cheese with a syringe if it were possible. (No, not really.) Based on other Yelppers mac reviews I may have to give it another shot. Maybe I got it on an off day."

And yes, it did remind me of my grandma&#39;s house.  I was very surprised to see that the place was nowhere near full during a Friday lunch.  I was glad because there was only one server and plenty of parking around back.

I ordered the fried chicken two piece plate and asked for a thigh and a leg, as did one of my dining companions.  We were both given a leg and wing.  I might of changed my order if I had been told I wouldn&#39;t have a choice.  The chicken was nicely crisped and flavorful.  For my sides I ordered the creamy mac &#39;n cheese (which was indeed creamy) and the fried okra (yummy and cooked with a cornmeal crust).  The cornbread that comes with every plate was three things cornbread should never be:  yellow, sweet, and dry.

Though a glass of Kool-Aid was tempting (you can even get it by the pitcher), I opted for the sweet tea.  This tea was not as sweet as the syrupy Southern sweet tea I was raised on but since my palate has adapted to drinking unsweet tea here in Denver, it was just sweet enough.  I really did not like the way my tea glass disappeared from the table for too long to be refilled and came back not filled to the top and without fresh ice.  I think someone needs to be walking around with a tea jug.

Maybe the owner, Priscilla, could bring some pitchers around as she walks through the dining room and stops by every table to say hello.  She asked us how everything was and let us know that the cafe has live jazz on Saturday nights.  Just like Grandma&#39;s (except there&#39;s no live jazz in the living room)."

I brought my fiancé here today after talking it up for a couple of weeks and it was unfortunately a very poor experience. The service was very nice but VERY slow considering we were the first and only people in for lunch on a Saturday. 

Our food took about 40 minutes to come out.  My fiancé ordered chicken and waffles. His waffle, syrup and butter pad were all ice cold. I ordered the frogs legs which were tasty, but very small. The waitress knew this and I didn&#39;t complain or anything, but told me I would be receiving two more to make up for their small size. I figured they would be out quickly but we waited an extra 15-20 minutes for them to come out. At that point we were ready to leave and I got them to go. 

I let the waitress know that my fiancé&#39;s food was cold and she was very apologetic and took a few bucks off of our bill. We would have said something about his cold food before he started, but we didn&#39;t want to wait another 40+ minutes for a new one. I appreciated the server&#39;s efforts but I don&#39;t think we will be back and that makes me sad. I used to love CoraFaye&#39;s."

We knew we were in for a real meal. And the food. Oh my! So scrumptious, you can taste the catfish, fluffy inside a cornbread coating.  Pork chops that are so thick,  juicy and richly flavored. My friend savored the majority of hush puppies and we both raved about the egg rolls, yams and smothered chicken egg rolls.

Not having breakfast, except a 1/2 Sprinkles cupcake, taking a flight that was delayed and going on 8 hours of not haven eating, was craving some comfort food and soul food sounded like it would hit the spot. so I Yelped it!
Had no idea that this was Guy Fierie triple D feature. 
The restaurant it cute, and reminds me of a dining experience in a Southern home.
Was seated prompty and saw the specials they had, and the waitress quick to point out that the Chittlin&#39;s were still available (apparently a hotseller) I was excited to see Oxtails on the menu, so I ordered that. It came with two sides, which I chose black eyed peas, candied yams, and corn bread and of course sweet tea.
While I was waiting Ms. Priscilla was going around to check on folks and chatted it up with me a bit.  They seems to know if you&#39;ve not been there before. Southern hospitality at it&#39;s best and reminded me of Georgia and Alabama. 
 Then the food came out. It looked good, thought I have to say that the Oxtails came smothered in white sauce. I&#39;m more accustomed to the brown gravy. The Yams were not canned, as they were sliced and still had the round shape you get when you cut it. 
The peas looked good, and it came with a big hunk Iof cornbread, while that&#39;s is the option I chose.
I began to dig in and that &#34;Oh I wanna like this&#34; kicked in. The oxtails seems quite fatty. ( I normally trim the fat and brown them first before cooking) Then the yams were good as well as the peas, but the temperature of the food was luke warm.  The bread was crumbly and the rice reminded me of Uncle Bens. I rarely if ever complain about the food to an establishment but I had to ask the server to heat it up. After that it was no problem, but the cornbread was a lost cause. I know the food had quite a bit of salt in because a person who has not eaten for 7 hours should have finished it,
While I was eating a jazz quartet  was setting to play and I managed to hear a few song. Quite good.
Well about an hour as I was driving around, that oh oh feeling hit. I was planning on seeing the Equalizer, but my evening was spent watching  that familiar movie everyone has to see a few times in their life, Porcelain Bowl. Not to get graphic, but after a few upper and lower end episodes, I felt shivery so I think may I have had a little food poisoning as I just pretty much crawled in to bed forced myself to two smart waters slept all evening.
I wanted to come back here but unfortunately will not be doing that. Even threw out the banana pudding I got to go, because I didn&#39;t want anymore episodes."

I even has red kool aid to drink!

My husbands catfish was AMAZING   Very potent and fresh. Yum yum. He wasn&#39;t fond of the hush puppies but fried okra of his was amazing. His catfish was the BEST We ever had. 

I loved my fried chicken as well. It was super moist yet crispy on the outside. The prices are very reasonable. $24 for two of Us! No regrets, great Sunday lunch"

Fried Chicken - BORING not much flavor
Greens - I was SO happy it was made w/ Turkey (i don&#39;t eat pork) &amp; the best thing I tasted from coraFayes so the greens get thumbs up
Mac&amp;Cheese - WAY too salty
Yams- tasted like they came straight out of a can
CornBread- They gave me 2 pieces I think because the first piece was stale &amp; hard as a rock. Second piece just crumbled in my hands LITERALLY.
Peach Cobbler - well that was PERFECTION!

Sorry CoraFaye I hate to write a bad review for anyone...but this just wasn&#39;t good! I would not come back...ok well maybe for the peach cobbler!"

Cora herself was extremely friendly and made you feel like you were sitting in her kitchen.  The only thing I didn&#39;t care for were the mashed potatoes.

Although the food is not prepared as fast as it would be in most restaurants, the wait was alright since I was able to read through the history of soul food on the menu and check out all of the things that reminded me of my childhood. 

Now, the food was very, very good. I had the catfish with greens, yams, and mac and cheese. The greens were flavorful without being over the top and made a great complement to the sweet potatoes. So much so that I asked for some to go. The fish was big enough for me to eat it while I was there and take some home to complement the greens and sweet potatoes. The mac and cheese was perfectly creamy. It was a little soft, but still very good. 

All in all, I can&#39;t wait to do that again. 

Quick note, plan for parking. There are only a few spots in the back and not much street parking."

This is the second time I&#39;ve been here and both times the food was delicious. The greens are flavored with turkey, so we non-pork eaters have nothing to worry about.

I usually don&#39;t eat dessert, but I couldn&#39;t pass on the berry cobbler the first time I was there or the peach cobbler the second time I was there. Both were piping hot and came with creamy vanilla ice cream. The prices are super reasonable. A girls&#39; lunch today ran us a little less than $12 each (including dessert) and we were both pleasantly full.

I can&#39;t remember the owner&#39;s name, but she always comes out to greet her customers and she is so sweet.

I&#39;m from Texas and my friend that was with me is from Louisiana, that being said our expectations of food are fairly high. As we walked into this less than fancy place we were greeted by smiling faces, a southern twang hello and an aroma in the air that was clearly from the heart!!

I actually felt really comfortable as the decor reminded of some of the family homes I  had once visited as a kid. Now on to the food I ordered the BBQ rib tips, with fried okra and cabbage, my friend ordered the frog legs and fish. Well i have to say i travel quite a bit and have the opportunity to try lots of different food, and this by far was the best southern cooking i&#39;d ever found that wasn&#39;t cooked at someones home. the flavors and textures were spot on in my opinion and i heard no complaints from my friend either!! 

So in conclusion if you are in the Denver area and looking for some down home cooking made with fresh ingredients do yourself a favor and dive into this little dive. My only regret was that I didn&#39;t take a piece of cake with me to go, but i will be back on cheat day!!!"

The fried chicken entree really hit the spot. The sweet tea was flavorful but not too sweet. And the peach cobbler was far and away the best peach cobbler that I have ever had.

When it came it was completely inedible.  I received one square of the red velvet waffle.  It was not freshly made, in fact it was burnt on the bottom and i could not even cut the waffle using most of my strength. I also received 1 chicken leg, which was not hot and pretty dry.  I shocked at the quantity, and while it may have been clear on the menu I&#39;ve never seen chicken in waffles served in such a sad manner.  My wife had the smothered oxtails; again cold and just lacked flavor.  The mac and cheese tasted like something out of a box nothing said home cooked and fresh about it.  The oxtails were covered with a heavy &#34;cool&#34; white gravy which again we were not expecting at all.  I was pretty surprised given the good reviews, but this place was pretty terrible.

I was searching for diners on yelp when I saw the reviews for the restaurant.  After looking through the reviews I remembered seeing it on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  At first I wasn&#39;t sure because I have tried other places featured on that show and was not impressed.   But this place was not one of those.   The dining area was very comfortable.   Decorated with what appears to be personal items and an assortment of tables and chairs that you might find in someone&#39;s home rather than commercial restaurant supply store.  The owner was very friendly and came out to visit with us about our order.  She asked about what we had decided to try.  When my mother told her that she had ordered just a burger she asked if she doesn&#39;t like other stuff like the fried chicken or catfish.   She had not noticed the catfish on the menu and opted for the safe option of a burger.  She called back to the kitchen and told them to change her order because she wanted to try the catfish.   She talked me into trying the greens which I am typically not a fan of.  Her food is amazing.   There is just no other way to describe it.  I had the fried chicken.  It was crisp, full of flavor and perfectly fried.  Many of the sides are old family recipes, including her greens, black eyed peas, beans and rice, and that too good mac and cheese.  One of my favorite things was the option of Kool-aid for a drink, offered as red, blue, or purple.  If you are looking for some real soul food, the type you would get from a friend&#39;s home in the south, this is the place to go.  Great unpretentious friendly place with delicious food.

The first time we came here, we were so excited.  The owner greeted us and maintained conversation. Which was followed by one of the best meals I&#39;ve had.

The second time, there was no owner. We were blindly seated and it took 10 minutes to get our drinks.  My boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles with a side of rabbit. The lady must have forgotten that sides still come with the meal and started to walk away before my boyfriend stopped her and ordered his sides.  Also his dad ordered hush puppies.
It took a good amount of time to get our food, which is TOTALLY understandable.  However, the waitresses weren&#39;t listening to the cooks ringing the bells.  Due to this, his mashed potatoes and my okra came out extremely cold, like it just came out of the fridge. His waffle could literally break a window as well. 
We ask the waitress to take the food back and give us new sides, which took her three times asking.  We also never got the hushpuppies his dad ordered, so we cancelled both the sides and the hush puppies.  
We also asked for refills which took another 10 minutes.  
We asked to discount our bill because we never got our sides back or our hush puppies. When we got the bill, she charged my boyfriend for his two sides which CAME WITH THE MEAL, CAME OUT COLD AND NEVER ATTEMPTED TO BRING BACK, and still charged me for my COLD okra which I never got. She said &#34;it&#39;s fine. It comes with the meal.&#34;

The waitress never even apologized or attempted to make us feel better about the situation. She just smacked her lips and avoided us.

All in all, I&#39;m very sad because this was my favorite place, and now I&#39;m never coming back.  It&#39;s sad what happens when the owner isn&#39;t around."

Now for the food. The fried chicken was super juicy, Mac and cheese had great flavor, and mashed potatoes w gravy was some of the best i have ever had. Not to mention the peach cobbler...omg incredible. 

Whether ur southern or not u just need to try this place...it&#39;s that good."

The food was delicious, the service was very friendly and quick, and the atmosphere and decor are truly unique. I had frog legs, okra, greens, and hush puppies and tried my friend&#39;s fried chicken. Everything was delicious, and I want to come back for the catfish. The owner took time with us to get to know us a little and explain more about the food. This is a hidden gem right on Colorado Blvd that makes you feel like you traveled hundreds of miles to the South."

I left the South 20 years ago and it&#39;s not easy to find real, authentic, good ol&#39; comfort food.  Cora Faye&#39;s offers simply great Southern/Soul food that I hadn&#39;t had in years.  

I&#39;m jonesing for the fried chicken, black eyed peas, cornbread, and banana puddin&#39; right now just writing this review... yummo!  My husband had the fried catfish, hushpuppies, okra, and cobbler and they were all excellent as well.  

Maybe I better go now and see if they&#39;re still open today. I need a Cora Faye fix!"

The service was similar to any service I got in MS. The owner came and introduced herself while we waited for our food. The decor was very southern.

Food took a little while to get to the table, but food was made fresh also. Mac and cheese was very creamy and the rice and gravy was good. I loved the chicken in the actual gravy. Pieces of chicken were bigger than you would get at most any restaurant. Seasoning on the fried chicken was delicious.

We did not have a chance to eat dessert, but it did look delicious."

I purchased a cookbook out of peer pressure, but I am sure I will end up sampling recipes from it.

My friend and I both enjoyed everything we ordered.  Even the red kool-aid!!

 4 stars only because my friend, Shon serves the best fried chicken and could give this place a run for its money!

I also thought it would be good to mention that while the fried chicken is a personal favorite CoraFaye&#39;s actually has quite a few other recipes for Southern food that have been passed down from generation to generation in their family for over a century. I mean when a recipe is so good it stand the test of time against over 100 years you know you need to try it. (You do know that, don&#39;t you?) In the menu, these recipes are marked with an asterisk and there are quite a few of them so you&#39;ll have plenty of reasons to go back.

Dine in or take your food to go, either way it&#39;s a dang satisfying meal. And for the love of all things delicious, do not forget to get some sort of dessert be it cake, cobbler or banana pudding."

This was most definitely worth our time in gold. 

We came here on a Sunday afternoon and were more than pleasantly surprised. The place is quaint and they certainly do a great job making you feel like you are in grandma&#39;s dining room. The service was incredible. We were immediately taken care of in the nicest manner possible. I felt like I was having lunch at a friend&#39;s place rather than an actual restaurant. 

The food: it&#39;s mouth-watering. I ordered the fried chicken and I ate every last bite with pleasure. It was juicy on the inside while the skin was fried to utter perfection. I had the fried okra as well which was delicious. The mashed potatoes and mac n&#39; cheese was only mediocre, not that it was tough to swallow. We also had the greens which were good. The corn bread was not yet ready so they offered us some hush puppies while our corn bread was given to us to go which was very sweet and thoughtful of them. 

Overall, this place is spot on. Whatever was not absolutely perfect was still satisfactory to the taste buds. The atmosphere was superb and I wouldn&#39;t change a single thing about it. Definitely a hit for us!"

Not sure what CoraFaye&#39;s they ate at but the one I went to was horrible.  I ordered the smothered chicken (that looked noithing like the picture) sweet potatoes and greens, my son ordered catfish greens and mashed potatoes.  
first off my food was luke warm not hot at all.  Everything was bland like it had no seasoning on it at all.  The catfish didn&#39;t even taste like catfish and it was battered fried.  The smothered chicken was bland and tasted old like maybe it was frozen and just thawed and served.  the sweet potatoes tasted like soap.  The cornbread was bland and grainy like it wasn&#39;t mixed at all The only thing eatable on my plate was the greens.  It was a big disappointment as I was craving soul food.

I expected to try some local beer and maybe get a little dinner since it&#39;s a brew-pub. I had no idea that a joint like this, in a location like this, would be one of the few places I have ever felt like giving 5 stars. 

The beer selection is huge!!! There is definitely something for everyone on their beer menu. If you can&#39;t decide, pick out a flight of beer ($10) from their entire selection. A very small portion of them are a little extra per flight glass. It was fun to taste different beers that you can&#39;t find anywhere (ie. the German Black beer), but that I have brewed, and to compare theirs to mine. The prices aren&#39;t bad either.

The food is amazing. Everything is homemade - including the delicious fries. I wish I hadn&#39;t ordered the appetizer basket of fries though ($5), because I just did not have enough room in my stomach for the entire pork chop dinner that I ordered ($18). I was a little upset about this. The fries are good, but that pork chop, the homemade mashed potatoes, and the fresh vegetables are to die for. My wife loved the veggie burger ($10 - HUGE).

The waitress was brand new. Aside from a bit of inattentiveness, she was very friendly, accommodating, and professional. I will forgive the moments when I wondered where she was because she didn&#39;t make me sit there and wait for the check or to sign the receipt. THANK YOU!!!"

I went to this place on a date night and it just blew my mind. Initially we were sat on a table right next to the bar and there was a football game going so you can understand how loud and emotional it can get. Since we were on a mood for a quiet dinner, the kind waitress moved us without issues to a more secluded area without any issues. The place got much better after that for us.

The food was really good and the beers were very tasty. They have an ample selection and great food selection.

I would definitely recommend this place."

The neighborhood looks...err...rough. Don&#39;t let the location deter you, the service and food quality are well worth a trip. 

We arrived for an early, midweek dinner on the patio. We were travelling ,and had our giant dog with us, so we opted for the patio (which is pleasantly covered - that&#39;s important for the later part of this tale). 

I quickly discovered the meaning behind their name &#34;Colorado Plus&#34; - they only have Colorado beer, wine, and cider on tap, plus they make their own beer in house. My wife and I settled on drinks, and quickly selected the hummus appetizer and vegetarian wrap special to share as our meal. The waitress recognized that we intended to share everything, so she asked if we wanted to have everything at once and split on 2 plates - yes and yes. Things continued to get better from tehre. 

After putting in our order, our waitress made sure to bring our dog a bowl of water. While there, she chatted with us and learned that we were in town for a show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. She gave us her inside scoop and details on the venue as a local, which was greatly appreciated. 

Shortly after our delicious food arrived, the wind picked up and it was clear a storm was on the horizon. Everyone else abandoned the patio and went inside, but we obviously had to stay since we had our dog. We sat outside, finished our meal and drinks under the covered patio, and our waitress continued to check on us the whole time (note: it was not a dangerous storm, just some pop up showers and wind). 

If you are in the area and looking for a local drink, delicious food, and amazing service, I highly recommend Colorado Plus."

Great selection of beer and a few ciders, you can&#39;t go wrong if you want to get a Colorado brewed draft but not able to drive to their brewery.   Not sure what you want then order a flight!!!

You are ALWAYS greeted by a friendly face and the staff is TOP NOTCH!  I can&#39;t always say that about all establishments because well you know not everyone likes their job.   At Colorado Plus they have hosted the GABF meeting several times and served up some incredible wings and things and we are always happy with the food too.   

Get your buns off the couch and check them out one sunny Colorado Afternoon and enjoy the patio, it&#39;s a good place to be if you are out and about and need a cold one in West Denver/Lakewood.

Their in-house selection is great, and they still offer lots of other beers from local CO breweries. The nice thing too is opting for a sampler if you want to try out a few different breweries at once. That&#39;s also a good option if you&#39;re feeling indecisive about what to order!

The food is also superb! Definitely way more elevated than your typical brewery food. Everything is locally sourced. I&#39;ve had the adult Mac and cheese, truffle fries, and vegan sliders.

This is definitely a good place to check out! It&#39;s especially nice in the warmer months when you can sit outside."

For starters: parking lot is a bit small and badly-marked.  Park at your own risk.

Sat at the bar and was served by the bartender.  He was pleasant and informative, patient with multiple questions and happy to offer suggestions.

Beer list with long and involved, which I like.  It makes for a hard decision each time I want a beer, but I love the variety and how spoiled we are for good beers in this great state.  Had a local beer, which I enjoyed.

As I had eaten lunch at 11am, had eaten nothing since, and it was approaching 730pm, I was hungry and inquired on a menu.  Bartender hinted it was burger night, and a special burger was their &#34;hot wing burger&#34;.  Being a lover of spicy food and torturing my sensitive stomach, I of course ordered said burger.  It was big, tasty, and pretty unique.  A bit too much sauce made for a soggy bun near the end.  Buddy ordered some fries as well, those were damn good.

I liked my experience overall.  Good beer, pleasant staff, tasty food.

Only complaint was the beer glasses.  I just have something against flutes.  I like the feel of a pint glass, and drinking from a flute isn&#39;t something for me.  This place served their regular draft beer in flutes.  Not a fan.  Give me a pint glass.  A regular ol&#39; pint glass, unless specifically required for a certain beer or style."

Good food in general and a great beer selection.   I&#39;m giving 4 stars, not 5 for these reasons.  I ordered the Mac n cheese and while good, it looked like the cheese has started to dry and become less creamy like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile.  Still good but could have been hotter and creamier.  I got the fried pickles and while good, my personal preference is for smaller pickle spears or pickle slices.  The spears were so big that the pickle to batter ratio was off, in my humble opinion.  The batter was crispy and good though.  The wings we ordered were good.  The chips tasty also.  

Another reason for 4 stars, not 5 was that our group of 8 had to reorder about 3 beers because they had run out.  Still lots to choose from so no huge deal.  One thing I like is that of the  beers they carry they tend to skip the ones you would expect and they offer lesser known beers by the brewery.  Good way to expand your palate.  

The customer service was also pretty good for our group even though they were doing some training for a new server.  Good job."

I love the idea of this place; and $10 flight of a bunch of different and rare beers is great. They have an incredible selection of Colorado beers; and it&#39;s a great place to bring a visitor to sample to great beer scene.

I&#39;ve been a few times, and I have to say the food is weak. The friend pickles are great, but other than that I was disappointed. The lamb gyro was pretty burnt, and the Cuban sandwich is just okay. If your veg, options are very limited but the veggie burger is decent. The prices for food are a bit inflated as well ($2 to sub side salad for fries).

Bottom Line: Visit for drinks and eat elsewhere."

The food is pretty good, not amazing but solid. I had &#34;adult mac and cheese&#34; which was cheesy and delicious.

Not sure how to put my finger on the experience but for starters, I did not get the most well-versed waiter, he couldn&#39;t really describe the beers I inquired about (e.g. taste, hoppiness, color) also, the restaurant/outdoor deck is missing a sense of warmth and understated,pub-like feel, it just seems contrived to me.

Once a week or so, we&#39;ll pull up an article or list from one online publication or another, pick a burger joint and give it a shot. Well, last night we were feeling lazy. Colorado Plus is within walking distance, and we hadn&#39;t been since 2 days after they had opened (they didn&#39;t have a full menu at the time). A 4 star Yelp review was enough for us...we walked on over. 

First things first: dog friendly patio. They seated us quickly and brought a bowl of water out for the pup. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and awesome. We ordered two flights and each had the Colorado Plus burger (I think that&#39;s what it was called). The burgers ere AMAZING. So decadent, it was like eating dessert. Easily in my top 3, if not the best. I can&#39;t stop thinking about it...if Colorado Plus doesn&#39;t make a best burgers in Denver list very soon, I&#39;ll be shocked. The fries and house made chips with dipping sauces were delish too. We will be back to try the rest of the menu in the very near future. Maybe. Or maybe I&#39;ll just get another perfect burger."

    ---   ---   ---

A huge shoutout to the guys at De Steeg for giving us the heads up on this spot. We had planned on trying our luck at a few different breweries, but we were told that CPBP really had the best selection of all the local breweries. They were right! I mean... they have 56 rotating Colorado beer taps. It&#39;s tough to beat that.

On my 2nd visit to Denver, I had to settle on going to a place like Yard House. Sure, they have a ton of beers, but the lack of local product made me really made me appreciate CPBP."

They have one of the best Colorado beer lists I&#39;ve ever seen, however the service even though friendly just seemed a little too absent. You know the type of service where when you&#39;re done with your meal they come to ask if you want another beer or a drink refill?  

The food I found was a tad lackluster as well. 

The Jalapeno poppers were massive, but only 3 on a plate. They were tasty, and had a great corndog type batter. I never tasted the &#34;pork belly&#34; that was supposed to be in them.

The famed &#34;Adult Mac N Cheese&#34;... $13, and had some of the fattiest pulled pork; had to pluck almost half of it out. This dish could actually do without the pork, and with more jalapenos. Even serve it in a smaller app size. 

The standout food that two of us had was the Bison Pastrami Reuben with truffle fries! I would go to Colorado Plus just for that. It was excellent."

I did the sample set so I could taste several beers from multiple locations without having to go to each location. I know, it&#39;s kinda cheating and I go to the actual brewery when I can, but it&#39;s nice to have options. 

The food was pretty tasty with our only complaint being slow service, but to be fare we had a table to 14 people, so you kinda have to expect a bit of a slow down with that large of a group at an off time with few servers on staff.

I love a good juicy burger and try them all over town. I don&#39;t mind paying extra when I have found perfection, and this one was far from it. As you can see from the picture it was more well done and lacked the juiciness and flavor I was looking for. The meat tasted funny, like it was exposed to the open air too long prior to cooking. The cook may have pressed it bit much while grilling and squished all the juice out. Their hand made sauces for dipping were very good. I definitely liked the bbq. Fries were hand cut which I always appreciate. 
Staffing- Whoever hired these folks hit a home run. Martina was my waitress and she had to be one of the kindest, most attentive that I have had. A big shout out to her! I didn&#39;t drink any beer, but I overheard the bar staff and they were extremely knowledgeable about the beer the severed and could explain each perfectly. 
I sat in the bar area. Very relaxed atmosphere. Several family get together and a few just enjoying lunch and playing cards. The bar is kind of dark, so if you want a little sunshine I would suggest sitting up front by the window or the patio area. I&#39;m sorry for the low rating but I just wasn&#39;t &#34;wowed&#34; or overwhelmed by my burger."

The negative is that you can only get growler fills of their beer (and you don&#39;t get any sort of price break for growlers). So that kind of stinks. It would be great to be able to get a growler of my favorite CO Springs brewery when they are on tap. This isn&#39;t to say the CO Plus beer is bad by any means, but allowing growlers of all the draft beer would be great. 

The food is always pretty good... nothing spectacular, but good. To be fair I haven&#39;t tried too much of the food. Ambience is great and the upstairs is cool."

So, I walked in mid-afternoon on a weekday and grabbed a spot at the bar.  The bartender was helping me before I even was seated.  This level of service in the bar was maintained during my entire visit.  During my 90 minute stay, I had the opportunity to talk with the owners/managers (Jae and Eugene), as well as the Brewmaster Adam.  All were quite friendly, knowledgeable, and all-around pleasant.

Colorado Plus really does a bit of everything.  They are a nano-brewery, an extensive tap house, a full bar, and they also serve food.  I sampled all four of their house beers, and enjoyed them all.  Some friends of mine had been there the previous day, and recommended the one with catnip in the hops.  The Mt. Owtsaca is described as &#34;5% ABV and 24 IBUs and is quite fruity due to the house blend of Belgian-style yeasts&#34;.  It was a solid, multi-purpose brew, that I found quite tasty.  Aside from the four in-house beers, I also sampled from other breweries that I have not yet had a chance to visit (the true beauty of a tap room).  

I liked that every beer in here is a Colorado Craft beer.  I also appreciated that they have gone beyond the most popular selections from other breweries.  Yes, you will find some of your favorites, but I also felt like I had a chance to sample some interesting lesser-known offerings as well.  From talking with the folks here, they keep up a rapid rotation of what is on tap, so this really is an ideal place for beer lovers who want to try new things, without burning a tank of gas and dedicating their whole weekend to criss-crossing Colorado. 

$10 for a flight of five 4-ounce pours was pretty reasonable.  Which reminded me that although I enjoy tap houses, I get irritated when I am charged as much for a beer at one of them, as I might pay for one at a nice restaurant (outside of happy hour).  Colorado Plus was NOT guilty of doing this.  This is not my neighborhood, but should I find myself in the area in the future, this will probably be my first stop."

Everyone seemed happy with their meal selection (did not hear one complaint). And the dessert...holy Toledo. Two of us got the homemade vanilla maple bacon ice cream -- yeah, that exists -- and it was to die for. 

We went here on a Monday night and had great service inside (thank you Martina!). We were a slightly difficult party, as I was meeting people for the first time and my husband hadn&#39;t seen these family friends in years, so we were chatty...Martina paid excellent attention to us and was extremely patient, as it probably took us 20 minutes to order beers and an hour to order food, lol. She also wasn&#39;t too overbearing at the same time, which I know can be a fine like to walk. She was fantastic and even took a picture of the 4 of us at the end for good measure.

Contrary to what I thought initially, it is not just a brew pub - it has a full bar for cocktails and also limited wine options. There was a cider and a mead on tap too for us gluten-free people. The taps change frequently so there is always a new beer menu when you come in.

The food is pretty good. It sounds really good and the chef uses quality ingredients that are locally sourced, but the execution could be better. I had the quinoa stuffed portabella which was very good. The quinoa was super creamy and the goat cheese was delicious. I opted for the side salad that was nicely adorned. Though nearly everything here can be made gluten free, the staff is not mindful of it at all. (The salads were brought with croutons, a hamburger came with the bun, etc.) 

I tried a bite of the burger (which is made from grass-fed beef) but it appeared to be a pre-formed patty and though the server asked how it should be cooked (my friend asked for medium) it was definitely well-done- which IMO, reduces the flavor so much, the quality hardly matters.

But if you&#39;re just looking to try some new brews, you can get 4 or 5 2 ounce tasters for only $8 which is a great deal- especially if you&#39;re trying some of the higher-end taps. Plus there is a really wide selection."

Most recently I came back to get some beers to kill time before a wedding reception. My absolute favorite part about this place? The beer flights. It&#39;s a great deal - $10 for 5 samplings, and they have a ton of locally brewed beers on tap.

The last couple times, we were sat towards the back of the restaurant near the bathrooms. Let me tell you, it wreaked of vomit. At first I just thought that it was a one time occurrence, but after the second time, it seems that it&#39;s their fragrance of choice for that section. While sitting there, I was also very curious as to why no one else seemed to be bothered by the smell at the table around me.

We decided to order a couple of small plates just to hold us over until the reception. We ordered some wings and parmesan truffle fries. The wings were good, nothing incredible. The fries were also pretty good. My only criticism for that would be the parmesan wasn&#39;t melted very well over the fries. They were pretty big shavings (borderline slices) sitting right on top of the fries. I also ordered a side of garlic aoli for dipping, which could&#39;ve used a little more garlic flavor.

The bartenders this evening were all sporting beards,which would make ZZ Top envious, with equally envious beer bellies. The good news? They were guys...whew! 

Both beer tenders were extremely knowledgable of all the taps and were excited to talk about their own hand crafted barley pops.

Its a pretty cool, laid out place, cozy and comfortable. The upstairs area has a unique art collection, bar, couches and set up for private parties.

I read a lot of the reviews and I was sold and happy to say I was not disappointed!  Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon to catch the game and enjoy a few brews at the same time.  Although I only sampled a few items on the menu, I would not hesitate to come back soon to try a few others.  My wife and I shared the hand cut fries and spicy fried pickles as a pre-game snack.  The fries were tasty and had a few options for dipping sauces.  The pickles were quarter cut fried pickles and were just a good.  I had the Whiskey BBQ Chicken sandwich for half-time and the jalapenos will bite but the sandwich was tasty to say the least.   
Aside from the food I sampled a lot of the local CO brews along the way.  The local taps were great.  I enjoyed the Bitter off Dead but if you like the fruitier beers the Seedless and Cranberliner held their own. Overall a great selection of local brews to sample\drink and something for almost everyone.
Some last thoughts-they had a number of TVs, so it was great to catch the game and best of all the wi-fi actually worked and was fast so while watching the local games I could check up on the scores on other games online.
Server was Jeff and he took good care of us the entire time.
Can&#39;t wait to go back."

Completely Colorado taps that rotate often. Creative daily specials. Friendly staff. Their mussels in the hefeweizen broth are fantastic and are actually resonably priced for the large amount you get.  The only issue I have ever had with this place is when they run out of some of their specials, which is completely understandable since they are new every day and subject to how busy they will be. If you are looking for good beer, and great food head here. And check out the cool gallery upstairs too!"

We got Poutine and the boyfriend ordered a beer flight. They don&#39;t update their beer list throughout the day so he had to reorder one beer nearly 3 times before they had one he wanted. I had the veggie burger and it was super good. Could have asked for mayo on the side because it was a bit heavy but the patty was really good!

It appears that this is not a random selection of about 30 beers on tap, but a careful selection of about 30 beers on tap. That is a difference worth noting. The actual beer list is awesome as it not only tells you the name of the beer, the brewery where it is from, the alcohol content, etc., but also a very good (and, accurate) description of the type of beer. 

The food is also very, very good (the fish and chips were the best I&#39;ve ever had, and the chili and reuben were very good). The place is a little pricey, but the ingredients appear to be very, very fresh and the food made with great care. I will pay a little extra for quality.

But, what makes this place a stand-out? The service. I hate going to a place where the employees seem like they do not want to be there, and resent you being there. Call me weird, but I do not want disgruntled people handling my food. However, this is not the story here. We went over a month ago, returned yesterday, and our waitress, Brittany, remembered us, where we had sat, and what we had ordered. In addition, all of the service employees we ran into seemed very pleased to see us. That&#39;s good service that makes you feel special. Sweet! Also, although she appeared to be very young, Brittany was very knowledgable about all of the beers and recommended a few that were spot-on. 

We will be back."

We sat outside for lunch on a sunny day. We got two flights of beers which are five -4oz cups for $10. All beer on tap are Colorado micro-brews - a great way for an Oregonian to check out Colorado&#39;s finest beer selections. I enjoyed the Apis IV, the Backcountry Pilsner, and Red IPA by Station 26. 

The Reuben sandwich is made with bison and came with a side of house-made chips. The sandwich and beer sure hit the spot. I would definitely come here again on my next Denver visit!"

The first visit was closer to their opening, so i figured perhaps they just were working out the kinks.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.

We stopped in here for what was supposed to be a quick beer and maybe a meal.  It took over 20 minutes for anyone to even approach our table to take drink orders.  We had to ask 10 minutes later for a round of waters too.  The service dragged for the whole meal.  And I mean, we must have been seated in no-man&#39;s land with how long it took.

The menu is pretty weak on the vegetarian options (salads and a sandwich), but thankfully I eat fish too, so a few more things were available to me.  I ordered the special which was a Blackened Mahi Mahi Ceasar salad for $9. When it arrived, the fish was weirdly cut up into small pieces like chicken.  The blackened spices were good, but the portion was minuscule.  The salad itself was pretty good if not a little heavy handed with the dressing.  Overall, the salad was tasty.

But, after waiting again, this time for the bill, i was disappointed to see that we had been overcharged for the special.  $10, even though the board said $9.  Kinda sketchy, but they corrected it quickly when we pointed it out.

I want to like this place.  They have great beers on tap and it&#39;s close to home, but the service thing is too much for me.  I don&#39;t need to be smothered, but I also don&#39;t want to be forgotten about--multiple times--during a visit."

The hostess barely said hello and was not very friendly. She sat us down and the server came over to take our order. He mumbled hello and put down the menus. He came back quickly to take our drink order. I ordered a beer sampler so he brought the tray over for me to write down the beers that I wanted and then never came back. We sat there patiently for 20 mins while other servers just hung out in the front of the restaurant and our server was no where to be seen. I was disappointed. I have been here twice before and thought it was great! So we ended up leaving with no food and no drinks.

A few of their own brews, plus only beers brewed in Colorado. There&#39;s so many great places brewing in Colorado, who needs to import? They always have a long list of brews on tap and it&#39;s always rotating.
It&#39;s a good feel, and you can lose hours here. The food is good, everyone raves about it but I&#39;d only give the food 4/5. It is really nice though that it isn&#39;t just bar food."

While they have a good beer list, their house brews are inexplicably expensive.  I appreciate that it&#39;s all Colorado beers though, so if you&#39;re looking for all local brews, this might be a good place to check out.  

If you want to try some of their spendier beers, the best way to go is a flight.  It&#39;s $10 for 5, 4oz pours.  We didn&#39;t try the food here, but it&#39;s pretty affordable.  Based on other reviews, sounds like it&#39;s hit or miss as far as speed / quality. 

I&#39;ll try it again and update my review, as I was there on a busy day (1yr anniversary), but they have a ways to go to be competitive in an increasingly crowded beer bar market."

I was actually reluctant to write my review, because I like that it&#39;s &#34;my neighborhood treasure&#34;, haha, but props go to where they are deserved and they do such a great job! As a beer lover and self proclaimed foodie, I am always thoroughly impressed with their vast variety of beverages and delicious food!! 

I find the service is always personable, which I appreciate and also just really appreciate the laid back environment, it&#39;s great to meet up for dinner or a couple of drinks!

Their menu has a wide variety to satisfy every taste bud, a bit eclectic with some classics and some new flavors. The quality and thoughtfulness that goes into the selections is very impressive. Some of my favorites are the firecracker chicken sandwich, salads, gumbo or the sliders + their fries and dipping sauces - I swear by! 

Plus I just love the evolution over the last year and their commitment to customers :) - I honestly can&#39;t say enough about them and think that whole team over their rocks!

The food is great- each time I&#39;ve been we wind up ordering all appetizers and sharing them amongst the table- they&#39;re all great. The Slider app makes a great meal- 3 sliders, choose any 3 of the 5 they offer, with a side.

Colorado Plus has an awesome selection of Colorado Craft Brews all in one place.  I love the idea of this brew/pub and it really hits it right on the head for those who don&#39;t like going to individual breweries, but still want to taste the different selections from around Colorado.  As a frequent goer of breweries I opted for a sampler of 5 from locations I have yet to try and low and behold they had what I was looking for.  They have 56 local beers on tap and at the time I went and 4 of their own in-house selections which included a Fruity Pebble selection which really had a fun unique taste.  All the samplers are $8 for 5 beers which is a steal of a deal when looking at some of the high alcohol selections.  

Along with beers they also had hard alcohol and wine making this a great place for beer snobs as well as others to hang out.  I also had the opportunity to try the Wings and the Tortilla soup and was delighted!  I was going in with some pretty low expectations based on the previous reviews, but I assure you these were some pretty tasty snacks! 

While drinking our beers we were informed they had an art gallery upstairs so of course we couldn&#39;t help but peruse the sitch and it again was awesome.  I don&#39;t know what I was expecting, but good lord this place blew every one of my thoughts going in out of the water.  I highly recommend anyone in the Denver area to hit this place up and enjoy!"

No uncertainty about what you got and which one&#39;s which...they&#39;re right there labeled in your own chicken scratch.
Really, really dislike how crammed in the tables are combined with the reverberating acoustics and the fact that they amplify the screaming children whose parents seem to congregate there.
In sum: 5 stars for beer and concept. 1 star for ambiance. Clearly the beer score was weighted to average 4 stars overall."

It&#39;s also a fairly open space with a second floor and I figured that my 2 year old would be able to run around a little if he needed to. He definitely needed to!

First off, the beer selection is great! While it changes often, during this particular visit they had a good number of special/hard to find barrel aged selections. I always gravitate towards those since they are hard to find in stores. Overall, 30+ Colorado breweries were represented. NICE!

Now on to the food. The menu is decent.  Not too big to overwhelm you with choices, but still a good variety of apps, salads, sandwiches, and entrees.  We were all very happy with what we ordered - wedge salad, CO+ burger, adult mac &amp; cheese, and mahi-mahi fish &#39;n chips. The wedge was very tasty! You can&#39;t go wrong with bleu cheese &amp; bacon! The adult mac &amp; cheese seemed to be missing something, but was still decent. Fish &#39;n chips was good too - it&#39;s hard to screw that one up! They also have a nice selection of dipping sauces. The stout ketchup and chipotle aoli were very tasty!

Service was great too. Our waitress was extremely cheery, friendly, and just attentive enough. Good job Colorado Plus, thank you for making my bday dinner great!"

It&#39;s in the same building with the same great parking, but the inside has been completely redone.  

Once inside, it looks very much like a brew pub that could be anywhere in the Denver area, but this one is different.  Nearly everything used in the construction of the interior is a Colorado product.  They used Colorado wood, Colorado stone, and Colorado tile among others.  It&#39;s all part of the theme to make this place a showplace of Colorado Special, and it starts with the beer.  

Not only do they brew their own Colorado beer right on the premises, but they have a team that goes around to other local microbreweries to sample their products, and bring back their choices.  The extensive tap menu changes every few days, so you can pretty much find something different every time you come in.  Still, that&#39;s not all.  They&#39;ve got food, too, and it&#39;s not all bar food.  

I was pleasantly surprised to discover not only good food, but a number of good &#34;vegetarian&#34; options, too.  As far as I know, the menu remains the same, and I found at least three, good vegetarian options on the menu suitable for a variety of tastes and appetites.  They also offer  gluten-free selections, and many of their dishes can be made gluten-free upon request.  

I stayed away from the Tofu Sliders, but I was kind of wishing I hadn&#39;t.  At other places, their vegetarian sliders are kind of mushy and flavorless, or some kind of homemade black bean burger.  These were not.  They were exactly what they said - tofu.  The tofu was fried up, and put on buns, and served in a trio for $4.00.  I thought that was a pretty good deal.  But, that&#39;s what my wife ordered, and she just let me have a sample.  I had something completely different. 

I had &#34;Tofu Parmesan.&#34;  I had never heard of such a dish, and, despite reading the description, I could not really imagine what it would be like.  Even when they brought it, I was still uncertain about my choice, but, once I tasted it, I was very pleased.  

The chef took a nice slab of firm tofu, breaded it just as he might a slice of eggplant, and otherwise completely the entree as if it were eggplant or something else.  Then, the tofu was plated, covered with a nice, tasty marinara, and served with a slice of garlic bread.  It does not come with the side of spaghetti I am used to, but I loved this dish nonetheless.  I wish more place would do this, but this is the only one I know of, and i am certain to come back to have it again.  If I do, I&#39;ll have it with the &#34;Wedge Salad.&#34;

My wife ordered the &#34;Wedge Salad&#34; and let me have a taste.  It cost $6.00, but I was extremely pleased with the &#34;Danish Blue&#34; dressing that they use.  I always tell people that the Denver Drumstick Restaurant, (long since closed), always had the best blue cheese dressing.  This Danish Blue dressing is the closest I have found anywhere I have been to reminding me of that great, great dressing.  If you like blue cheese dressing, you will love this dressing.  It&#39;s that good.  

If you like beer, come for the beer.  You will not be disappointed.  The beers are all excellent, and fairly priced.  But, while you are there, take some time to try the food.  I cannot speak for the other items on the menu, but, if they do those as well as they did the vegetarian options, they must be great.  Even if they aren&#39;t, I&#39;ll vouch for the vegetarian options, and give them my highest recommendation.  

Until people realize that the restaurant at Valente&#39;s has opened up under a new name, and a new owner with a new cuisine, it may be difficult to find.  But, once people find out, it may be difficult to find a parking spot.  Go now, and beat the rush.  This place is going to be popular.

- Rubin sandwich w/homemade potato chips 
- Fish &amp; chips (fries) 
- LTO hamburger w/ blue cheese  &amp; fries

We just got back from beer and late dinner here this evening, and it was only their 2nd night of official business. We heard about them from (I&#39;m assuming) one of the owners, who also works at our preferred local liquor store. We noticed the great beer selection at the store, he noticed us noticing it, and mentioned this place. 

They focus on only Colorado Craft beer, and carry some rather small and/or inaccessible breweries. Well, maybe not inaccessible, but I just don&#39;t wanna drive to Fort Collins or Aurora, OK? So yeah, I like that they bring the beer to me. 

Gotta say- our server was absolutely incredible. All the tables around us and all the servers were on top of it, constantly refilling waters and checking in on tables. Our server got our food and drinks so quickly it was nuts, and probably aided by the owner pouring beer at the bar. Beers are VERY reasonable- very few are over $5/unit (pint, 10 oz, tulip glass, depending on the beer), my husband even had a beer that was over 10% for $5. I loved the beer we tried and I was thrilled that we both tried only beers we&#39;d never had before- that can be sometimes hard to do for the beer drinker in CO, even though we have amazing beer resources around.

For food we got the charcuterie plate and the fries with pork belly. My husband and I both thought the fries would have green chile on them or something, but actually it&#39;s just fries with fried bits of pork belly- it was our own fault for interpreting the menu in a way they clearly didn&#39;t even imply. It was still good, don&#39;t get me wrong. The charcuterie was fine- probably not worth the $11, at least not until it has some more interesting cheese and/or some crackers. However, our waiter made sure to ask for feedback on the menu, so i told him this, as well as a few clarifying questions relating to the other items, and he not only listened but made careful note on the menu to show it to the kitchen staff and try to work out the kinks and clarify the descriptions, prices, etc. Any hesitance I had on the menu went away after his clear dedication to our feedback- keep in mind this wasn&#39;t the manager or owner!

Upstairs is a separate bar with lots of art, armchairs, etc. It&#39;d be a great place for a private event, and this place is really spacious, with ample indoor and outdoor seating. I really, really hope to see Colorado Plus succeed, maybe aided by summer weather and a happy hour (maybe? that&#39;d be the icing on the cake for me). Regardless, I am a very happy camper with this place, and I really can&#39;t wait to come back."

Well, I&#39;m not a fan of Coors but I still acknowledge it&#39;s made right there in Golden, Colorado.  Don&#39;t believe me?  Go up there and see for yourself!

We had the server choose our entrees.  I have always done this when I dine at Nobu restaurants.  She made perfect choices based on our likes and dislikes.  One dish that is a must is the miso black cod.  It is just out of this world.  The sashimi dishes were amazing.  Top quality freshness.

Service here is great but understandably it gets a bit sketchy on a weekend night.  

You have to try the shaved ice dessert.  The presentation is fun and it is scrumptious."

Servers do not know the menu well or ingredients in each menu item. The omakase at this location cannot be catered towards people with food allergies. Disappointing bc typically what I get.

Presentation- nice
Service speed- slow
Sushi chefs- great
Valet- 7 bucks, was told to give server ticket to have car pulled around but since she was scarce...we had to just wait at valet stand.

Bento dessert- chocolate lava cake raw...not what a chocolate lava cake is suppose to be...way undercooked but maybe it was because we were one of later people to leave. Definitely skip this item.

Being new to Denver...and hearing that this was good for sushi...severely disappointed. For the price, expected that servers would know the items on the menu and what ingredients are in each plate...plus faster service."

No argument, and I&#39;ve been to the rest (usually preferring a drive to Vail over any sushi restaurant in Denver).

Their fish is fresh and always supurb. The only downside is that their non-sushi or sashimi dishes range in interest and taste, with a grilled lamb chop with mole sauce being an unwelcome part of our otherwise amazing set of courses.

Although superb quality, the price is rather high compared even to NYC where the fish also have to be flown in.  However, with the quality of this restaurant setting a high bar in Denver, I truly hope other sushi restaurants will follow course.

I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have to drive to Vail anymore for excellent sushi."

One of the signature plates you&#39;ll want to try is their yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. If you&#39;re not a &#34;fish&#34; kind of person, then first of all, shame on you. Second of all, just try it. For sushi enthusiasts it&#39;s about as close to eating by the sea as it gets.  It&#39;s one of those moments where you think you put fish in your mouth. Was it fish? What is that? It tastes like what I&#39;d expect an appetizer from heaven to taste like - something undescribably amazing. When you eat something as euphoric as this, you can invent as many new words as you please. 

Move on to some rolls, or the salmon skewers - OH the salmon skewers!! These little guys are about as pleasing to your taste buds as the salmon just dances off the stick and slides apart in your mouth. Again, another one of those moments where you want time to stop. You see people at your table talking but you can&#39;t hear the words. There is music playing in your mouth. You don&#39;t want to chew because you don&#39;t want this moment to end. A tear may start to form from one eye. A small quiver of the lip slowly builds as the emotion of the moment is so overwhelming. 

Ok, let&#39;s be honest, none of that happened. But it all did go through my head in a flash of a thought. And it for sure is now one of the best land locked sushi restaurants sure to stay at the top of the game for a long time. 

Bravo my friends. You win."

Since Matsuhisa Aspen opened my senior year of high school it has been my favorite place to eat. Once I heard that there was one opening up in Cherry Creek, walking distance of my house, I was elated.

Finally, was able to go to Matsuhisa Denver a little over a month ago for the first time since they opened there doors and had an experience with the food and service that was not indicative of the Nobu brand.  

I was not willing to give up on one of my favorite restaurant brands. My wife and I were seated and started on a journey that would tantalize our tastebuds. Our waiter brought dishes that were so flavorful and we could tasted all the thought and care that went into every bite of every dish. 

The Sommelier contributed to this experience as well. He took the time to look and see what we ordered or what was coming to the table and suggested bottles or glasses of wine to pair nicely with each dish. I could not thank him enough by the end of the night. 

We will be back and now have our go to sushi restaurant in Denver!!  Thank you everyone!!"

Now let me start by saying I appreciate sushi and am not afraid to pay money for good food. I&#39;ve been to three different nobus, katsuya, blue ribbon and still love Uchi (just to name a few ) I have also eaten at many less expensive sushi places. but those 7 places were what I compared last nights dinner to. 

Service: our server was amazing. She was detailed and patient with my celiac guest. She was super friendly and upbeat. The young man who brought us water was pretty annoying. Mineral, sparkling, or Colorado tap. Mmm tap was fine with us and he made it known by repeating it 3 times. As if it was the wrong decision. 

Drinks: couldn&#39;t bring myself to pay $17 for basically a Hendricks and tonic with some ginger in it. So I optd for the $14 elderflower cocktail. Overall good idea for the drink but execution was off. Something with the aftertaste didn&#39;t seem right. After that, I stuck with my Colorado tap water. 

Food: ordered the Nobu lobster taco for an app. Tiny. But stuffed with lobster which I appreciated. I also ordered the chicken wings. Presentation was different and they had no taste or sauce. Would not order again. 

Ordered 4 rolls: size of rolls is about 6-8 pieces. So I appreciated that they weren&#39;t tiny. Prices averaged from $9-20 per roll. Comparable. The himachi roll was a waste. The two house special rolls however were good. The shrimp tempura roll was bland and boring. 

Overall I was full by the time dinner was over. $110 was cheaper than I expected but nothing there was wowing, creative or amazing that would make me come back. Lacking that zing, flavor and creativity that I am use to at other upscale expensive sushi places."

Here are a few of my favorite dishes from the night -
1.) Black Cod - Just do it. Melts in your mouth.
2.) Spinach Shrimp Salad - Yes, I said spinach. Who knew truffle oil could make you crave a salad!?!
3.) Tempura Crab Legs - Fried &amp; delish.
4.) Jalapeño Hamachi - High quality flavorful fish.

Lastly, I had a couple large bottles of Kirin beer to quench my thirst. Pure bliss."

Matsuhisa just opened up right below my cousin&#39;s apartment! I&#39;ve been to Nobu in LA, so I just had to try this place with the family! Although this place is expensive, you know you should be getting some pretty good quality food. This is definitely a nice restaurant, but causal attire is fine! 

Let&#39;s just say we ordered a TON of food. My favorites were definitely the Miso Black Cod, Sea Bass, King Crab Tempura, and the Rock Shrimp. As for the rolls, I really liked the Lobster and Spider rolls. We ordered family style so we could get a variety. If you look at my pics, you can see what we got! For drinks I&#39;d recommend the Matsutini!! I love passion fruit! Service was great..they had a lot of staff that came around and cleaned up our plates multiple times throughout our dinner.

There are restaurants where you go for a meal, and there are restaurants where you go for a culinary experience.  For good or ill, this is definitely the latter.

Everything you will eat here is utterly fantastic, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is spot on.  It&#39;s just that Matsuhisa isn&#39;t so much a place to eat as it is a place to showcase the chef&#39;s talents.  You could choose your dishes simply by throwing darts at the menu, and everything you eat will be unique and delightfully flavorful.  But if you were hungry when you arrived, you will also be hungry when you leave (unless you&#39;ve got WAY more money to throw at restaurants than I do).

With that one caveat, I really do recommend this place.  Just go when you want to sample some culinary art, instead of when you want to eat."

I mean they serve the sake in a bamboo carafe! How fun is that?!  There are a few ways to approach ordering, as your server will tell you.  You can order any dish off the menu and it will come to the table when it&#39;s ready.  In other words, there really isn&#39;t a course system, everyone at the table is assumed to be sharing each dish.  The other option is to have the chef choose your dishes and make a personal tasting menu. For about $125 per person, the chef will take into account your likes, dislikes, and allergies and prepare about eight dishes. 

My friends and I each chose about 2 dishes.  Everything was delicious.  I really liked the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the nobu tacos.  Everything looked amazing, and I really think you can&#39;t go wrong."

I can&#39;t believe this is a &#34;NOBU&#34; restaurant. I&#39;m seriously shocked! I&#39;ve eaten at many of his restaurants and this one.... I don&#39;t even know where to begin. 

I wish I could give no stars...

The only thing this restaurant has is the decor and ambience. It has a fun vibe. With that said, there&#39;s plenty of other restaurants near by that have great vibes and great food.

The sushi??? Awful! Hapa has much better sushi and that&#39;s not saying much. I would say I know what good sushi tastes like. Coming from SoCal and now living in Denver it&#39;s hard to find good quality fish. We&#39;ve had top notch sushi going from Michelin star &#34;MASA&#34; in NYC to Sushi Den right down the street and everything in between. Sushi Den will continue to be our #1 sushi spot. We have no intentions coming back to this establishment. 

The fish is way too fishy. The blue fun toro was awful. Not fatty at all. The scallop sashimi was super slimy my husband couldn&#39;t even eat it. The yellowtail tartar with caviar was inedible. The miso black cod was decent. But who goes to sushi for cooked fish? I felt rushed the whole time. I don&#39;t see this place staying in business!"

Five of my friends and I tried Matsuhisa Denver for the first time last night. We had reservations but got to enjoy cocktails at the bar while waiting for our party to arrive. The house martinis are anything but traditional and simply to die for! My choice for the evening was The Gardener: a unique blend of cucumber gin infused with cilantro and jalapeño essences. A great sipper that pairs well with bold flavors. 

For dinner, we agreed to let our waiter, Mr. Excellent (Sean to his peers), pick all of our food for us. We told him of our allergies, preferences, and target price per person ($100 + drinks), and let the good times roll. 

Mr. Excellent did not disappoint. 

Over the course of 3 hours, we enjoyed selections from both the regular and specials menus, sampling some 11 dishes plus dessert: The most amazing tuna poke in the world; Seared pork belly served with a blueberry/blackberry balsamic compote and crispy Brussels sprout petals; Miso black cod lettuce cups; Columbia River salmon sashimi with wasabi salsa; An entire Bluefin collar served with a garlic ponzu dipping sauce. It was all so wonderful on the palette. Chai shaved ice over vanilla ice cream and candied ginger. And those are the things I can remember. The favorite by far was the Bincho Truffle sashimi. 

All told, our bill with plenty of cocktails and tip came to $1000, or $167 per person. It&#39;s not going to be soon, but we will be back."

The ambience and overall vibe of this place is amazing, modern Japanese feel with outstanding service. 

Every single thing on the menu is exceptional but the entrée that stands out the most to me is the black cod. It was perfectly cooked and just melted in my mouth. It will be very hard to not keep getting the same thing when I go there! 

Have some fun and try the oyster and uni shooters, I personally recommend the oyster one. So much yum in a little shooter!

Of course I&#39;ve had bad meals before, but I really felt deceived here.  Having been to other Nobu restaurants in Hawaii and Las Vegas, we knew what to expect in terms of quality and price, and those restaurants set the bar and kept us coming back.  We always loved Nobu restaurants, and we were thrilled that there would be one in our own backyard.  However, this restaurant fell far short of our expectations and we won&#39;t be back.

The good:
- The sashimi was fresh and all of the fish preparations were tasty
- The Matsutini and the Gardener (prepared with tequila) were great cocktails.  

The bad:
- We ordered the omakase and this one fell short.  Even though we&#39;ve had the omakase at other Nobu restaurants, we decided to go with it here too.  There have always been new creations thrown into our other meals, and we always enjoyed his signature dishes like the yellowtail or tuna with crispy rice, and cod.  Our waiter didn&#39;t have any details to offer when we asked about it, but we figured we couldn&#39;t go too wrong based on our other experiences.  However, in the Las Vegas restaurant (where we ate just a few weeks ago) we told the waiter our price point, and he created a great menu for us and threw in some special dishes, even with my husband&#39;s shellfish allergy.  Or at least he said it was a custom menu.  Even if it was just his regular spiel, he was so energetic and friendly, that we felt special regardless.  But that certainly wasn&#39;t the approach here.   Our server seemed aloof.  And the dishes that were presented weren&#39;t the greatest.  I didn&#39;t get the cod, although my husband did.  And one of our courses was miso soup, and another was a salad (daikon, I think), tossed in truffle oil.  These courses felt more like fillers, maybe because of his shellfish allergy, but we didn&#39;t have that type of experience in Vegas.  These dishes certainly didn&#39;t have the wow factor.  The dessert choice was also a little baffling.  It was an espresso dessert which turned out pretty good.  However, it&#39;s not one that I would have ordered for myself, given that I&#39;m not a big coffee person, and I&#39;m not sure everyone wants to have a coffee dessert in the evening.  I thought the shaved ice would have been more generally pleasing and still a unique offering.
- My husband also made sure to tell the hostess that we were there for my birthday, but no did anything or even greeted me.  Not even our server, even after he carded me for my drinks.  Even the cashier at Trader Joe&#39;s noticed that it was birthday on my ID and greeted me.  It&#39;s not like I walked in there with a t-shirt and shorts on.  I was dressed up like I had somewhere to go.  Go figure.

The ugly:
- The worst part of it all is that we felt like we had been deceived by our waiter.  My husband and I typically ask for recommendations of wine pairings with our meals.  In Las Vegas, our waiter did a great job pairing all of our courses with wine.  Here, we ordered as our glasses became empty, and once again we asked for recommendations to go with our dishes, especially since we had ordered the Omakase and didn&#39;t know what the upcoming dishes were.  But upon receiving the check, we noticed that the glasses our waiter had given us were $33 and $21 PER GLASS.  Not bottle.  The waiter recommended and served some of the most expensive glasses of wine.  And stupid us, we got more than 1 glass of each, not thinking anything of it.  His greed was very short sighted, because he&#39;s now lost patrons for the restaurant.  And I warn you now, even though it seems tacky, ask for the price of your drinks here.  I usually don&#39;t, and probably still won&#39;t at notable restaurants, but if you dine here, please do for your own sake.  Even if he felt it was the genuinely the best pairing (although I also disagree with this-he gave me a red when the next course was a fish course, and then offered my husband a white after that course. I hardly think the choices were well timed), a subtle hint or suggestions that these were some of the most expensive glasses would have been appreciated so that we weren&#39;t surprised later.  Had he done that, I don&#39;t think we would&#39;ve been upset.  My husband and I have been to many restaurants, some rated the best in the world or with Michelin stars, and we have never had this issue of someone up-selling us.  We&#39;re not strangers to paying up for great quality service and food, but we walked out of this experience pretty upset.  Not a happy birthday present.  Next time I&#39;ll just go to Sushi Den for a few nights in a row, or hit up all 3 in that family, and leave happy with all the money I spent."

That said, you&#39;ve seen the other reviews. The quality is outstanding, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is what you&#39;d expect for a high-end Cherry Creek restaurant.

Highlights: Miso Black Cod, Yellowtail Jalapeno, and the Chai Tea Shaved Ice Dessert.

Food was outstanding! Yellow tail with jalapeno, lobster tacos, black miso cod and rock shrimp in a beautiful sauce. Great wine selection.

The real star of the night was the desert selection. You MUST try the shaved ice with, the presentation and flavors are totally unique and delicious.

The wait staff was so kind and very personable. This is an expensive meal, but worth every penny!"

My favorite dish is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño The Bento Box desert is basically a slice of heaven, the molten chocolate lava cake served with fresh berries and green tea ice cream...yum! 
They accommodated our request for no onions, chives, leeks, etc without issue. The overall service was impeccable, they even put a candle on my husband&#39;s dessert since we were celebrating his birthday!
Matsuhisa is off of a busier street, so valet parking for $7 is available. It was quite busy while we were there, so I would recommend reservations on the weekends."

3 Stars: Price 

I came here a few nights ago with my friend who is extremely picky about food, hoping to expand her horizons a bit. Derek, our waiter, was extremely helpful in finding us the perfect meal. The udon soup was probably some of the best I&#39;ve had. The lobster tacos were small, but tasty. The seared tuna with truffles practically melted in my mouth. We finished with a sushi roll with salmon and avocado that was delicious. Derek also paired our meal with a nice, crisp, Sauvignon blanc. The wine prices are reasonable, but the rest of the meal was pretty expensive. I would definitely come back for quality of food and excellent service."

The food and sushi gets better and better each time as does the service. They seem to have found their groove now that they&#39;re about 6 mos post-opening. The sushi was fabulous, and the other items on the menu - shrimp, beef, cod, etc. are also very good - to say they&#39;re &#34;good&#34; does them a disservice really. The food is notable, different, tasty, delicious, I could go on. They have an extensive menu that offers so much more than just sushi, but is fish-focused with some beef/chicken options. 
This place is *not* for the faint of heart when it comes to getting the bill. It is very expensive even when compared to other high end sushi and steakhouses in Denver. I think this is the most expensive tab we&#39;ve ever had for dining out on our anniversary dinner - $450 for two, which included some mixed drinks and a couple glasses of wine, no dessert. The cucumber/octopus salad was $20 to give an idea of pricing. It was really good octopus though. :)"

Unfortunately our experience did not live up to the hype. The food was very good but it&#39;s not any better than Sushi Den and they are charging three times more! I was expecting it to be expensive and worth the splurge but it&#39;s just on par with other good sushi places in town. We were going to do the Omakase but after hearing the description (only 8 pieces for $175 per person!) we decided to just order nigiri and rolls - all of which were good but not &#34;Nobu&#34; good. 

Their wine and cocktail list is also ridiculously priced. Last I heard alcohol costs the same all over town so there is no reason that a gin cocktail should be $17. 

The worst (and probably funniest) part was the snobbery that the server had when we decided on &#34;tap&#34; water (i.e. regular water) instead of paying for mineral or sparkling water. The waiter actually said &#34;here is your TAP water&#34; to us. We just started laughing as soon as he walked away. 

The interior is beautiful but the tables are SO close together. Not so much the romantic vibe I was hoping for. We won&#39;t be back, I would much rather spend my hard earned money at Sushi Den or Sushi Sasa. 

PS There is very limited street parking and even though you will end up paying $100 per person for your meal the valet isn&#39;t complimentary. The valet parking spots are literally RIGHT next to the stand so it&#39;s not like these guys are running down the block in the rain to retrieve your car - they are just pulling it out of the parking spot for you."

We decided to order the nobu signature and the chef&#39;s daily creation which if I remember correctly was at least an eight course meal per order. All courses were refreshing and delicious, but due to high expectations and all the hype fell short. Was a good experience but sushi den and izakaya den are still my favorite sushi restaurants."

We sat at the bar and for the most part let the chef pick our dishes, he did a great job with the selections. Everything was extremely good and we tried a few things I would have never picked myself. Great flavor and beautiful presentation throughout. Also, for a sushi joint they made some killer lamb chops, anyone who describes them as &#39;too fatty&#39; clearly doesn&#39;t appreciate good lamb.

I think some of the negative reviewers must have been too fixated on the price to enjoy their meal.. To be clear, this is an expensive restaurant, and in my opinion the cocktails are unnecessarily pricey, but if you want a top tier dining experience this place will suit you well."

After giving it a try, I have to say that I had a great experience! The servers were all super friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. They were attentive throughout the entire meal, constantly checking on us, refilling water, and asking how we liked certain dishes. Since the menu isn&#39;t very descriptive, I really appreciated their extra attention and willingness to explain things in a bit more detail. They even told us how certain things came to be menu items which was really fun to hear. Our group feasted on quite a variety of rolls, handrolls, sashimi, and entrees. One of the stand outs of the evening was the mushroom salad which included 5 different types of mushrooms. We also ordered the amazing shaved ice dessert which is super impressive and SO delicious!

As for the food, it is ok to good, but the beverage service is completely out of whack. The Sake selection is mostly proprietary and all but one option is / are extremely expensive. Gave up on sake and went to wine by the glass. Not once but twice in one dinner I ordered wine for two and got only one glass. WTF?

Note to Sommelier, try offering what the customer wants and not what is going to bump your sales numbers. When in doubt let the customer refer back the wine list. It&#39;s there so use it and don&#39;t assume that you are the only one in the room who knows wine. 

With regard to sushi, I honestly think you could do better at King Soopers, Tiny little, below average sushi. I am a twice a month Sushi Den customer and I am not afraid to spend money on good sushi. Good sushi I did not have at Matsuhisa. Extreme high prices, ok service, opaque beverage choices and poor sushi. I would only be back if I was spending someone else&#39;s money. Just because it is expensive doesn&#39;t make it good. Seriously."

The food was good/decent, certainly didn&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the price of $100-200 for dinner for 2. 2-3 stars for value, 3-4 stars for food flavors, 4-5 for quality of fish and food and atmosphere. I&#39;ve eaten at all the more upscale sushi restaurants in Denver, the sushi here is pretty plain and not very fun or flavorful. Dishes were better than the very standard sushi.

King crab tempura- 5 stars
Lamb- super fatty,  -2 stars

PRO: Ambiance, quality sushi, friendly staff, fun vibe.
CON: Ridiculous expensive, waitress upsold menu items, quick to remove plates with food remaining(don&#39;t rush the guests!), cocktails/sake list grossly overpriced.

Overall, a good experience, as the sushi was dynamite, but too expensive to make it a regular stop in my &#39;restaurant circle&#39;. I likely spent twice what I typically do at other favorite sushi restaurants around town. And that was me tempering the waitress, who kept pointing out all the most expensive items as &#34;must try&#39;s&#34;. Also, I passed on my beloved sake, because the options were so outrageously priced, very disappointing...$20-40 for a 4 oz pour, c&#39;mon folks....

We shared an enormous variety of foods. Everything was well executed with very fresh ingredients and beautifully presented. The food is simple but refined. My favorite was the very simple melt in your mouth yellow tail jalapeño sashimi. We had an unusual crab with a unique presentation which tasted a little cleaner than other crab. Anytime the sake and little plates keep coming the bill easily adds up. I have two complaints. Six of us were squeezed together at a table suited for four. Giant tvs are so tacky at a restaurant in this price point. Otherwise the space is beautiful.

I tried Matsuhisa three times now.  I think the food is good.  The decor, ambiance and people are great.  We loved most of the food items we had the opportunity to taste.  The restaurant is excellent addition to Cherry Creek.  I disagree with a lot of the bad reviews on Yelp.  There&#39;s no way the food is from King Soopers.  The restaurant is a competitor with the other sushi restaurants in town while they are probably working out kinks after just opening.  I love Sushi Den and Sushi Sasa and several others. If I&#39;m in Cherry Creek having happy hour and in the mood for Sushi after being at Del Friscos or North or Hillstone, I&#39;m going to go to Matsuhisa or Kona ;).

I was completely astounded by the rudeness of our server. 
We were rushed through each course--couldn&#39;t even enjoy what we were eating because we had to be interrupted over and again to pick up the menu in order to choose the next entree so that our server would calm down. 
Picked up plates before we were finished, asked, &#39;Is that all you&#39;re ordering?&#39; but really, the best was when we asked a question about a dessert and he couldn&#39;t be bothered to describe it, so started saying &#39;Blah, blah, blah&#39; as part of the description. Really couldn&#39;t believe any of it.

I was thinking of words that would match this experience, and really, I just felt bullied. Nice way to feel after dropping $350...which is another thing--this place is way overpriced. The food definitely is not good enough to fit in this price point.   

This place is a scam with no integrity."

Never tried a dish I did not like. The ambience is great. Price point is just what one would expect from a Nobu Matsuhisa restaurant. Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re on a budget.

As far as ordering sushi, I wouldn&#39;t recommend ordering more than one or two rolls. Your best saving your dollars else were. You don&#39;t come to Nobu or Matsuhisa to order sushi. Yes the sushi is still great. However, if your craving just sushi you&#39;re better off going to a sushi restaurant, such as Sushi Den. 

As for any review I have previously made mentioning other Denver sushi restaurants mis-labeling products. I saw a news report stating multiple Denver restaurants had been caught mislabeling fish at rates up to 36% and mentioned in my comment that sushi den was under investigation. I must retract this defamatory statement for after further research I have found that Sushi Den in fact was never one of the restaurants under investigation for mislabeling fish. Up to my knowledge both Matsuhisa and Sushi Den have never engaged in such conduct."

Our waiter, Shaun, was very helpful &amp; said that we could give him a price range &amp; he would put together a menu for us. We&#39;re so glad we took him up on his offer!

I&#39;ve been here twice now and both times everything from start to finish was incredible! The first time I was with a group of 7 people and very single one of us loved every dish we had.  In fact, the food was SO fresh and delicious that no one would let our server take any plates away until until all of the food was gone. Also we were all very impressed by Carlos, who I only saw the first time. Not sure if he was a manager or sommelier, but his knowledge of wine and getting something that all of us would like was very impressive. 7 different palates are not easy to please. 

My second experience was at the bar and Wes was our bartender. One of the most attentive and knowledgeable bartenders I&#39;ve ever met. He really took the time to ask all of the right questions and made our experience wonderful. The cocktails were almost too good and it was scary how easily they went down. Just don&#39;t be deceived, they are still strong! 

If you want rolls filled with mayo and too many heavy sauces, go somewhere else. If you want extremely fresh tasting and amazing seafood dishes and sushi, go to Matsuhisa! It is on the pricier side, but they have their fish flown in fresh multiple times throughout the week, so just save up, indulge, splurge and enjoy! Worth every penny. 

MUST TRYS:

- Yellowtail Jalapeno
- King Crab Tempura
- Spinach Salad (I&#39;m not even a fan of uncooked spinach) 
- Miso Cod Lettuce Cups
- New Style Salmon or Scallops or really anything 
- Any dish with Truffle Oil
- Adam, Dragon and Tiradito(sp?) Rolls 
- Shaved Ice Desert
- Any of the cocktails Wes recommends"

We tried the sashimi and thought it was comparable to Hapa Sushi. The miso black cod was decent but was really small.  The lobster tempura was just ok. Salmon salad was nothing special. The new style sashimi and yellowtail sashimi were ordinary. The sushi rolls are mediocre. My sashimi combo was not great. It seemed like something I could&#39;ve purchased from the supermarket.

OMG it was horrible and I wanted to throw up after the meal.  One of the worst meals ever and ridiculously expensive.  My son who resides in LA was like I told you we shouldn&#39;t gone there and he eats very well in LA.,well I guess live and learn.  Just because food is expensive doesn&#39;t however guarantee its good.  Nobu, I wish you would take more pride in your food and train your staff properly as opposed to opening yet another expensive restaurant, its like a huge chain of restaurants, about equivilent to the other corporate restaurants but a lot more expensive and not worth the trip!   I&#39;ve had much better food in LA, NY and Japan in fact there are a few really good Japanese restaurants in Denver like Sushi Sasa or Sushi Den.  This restaurant is typically located in Cherry Creek, posh but over-rated area!"

High culinary skills aren&#39;t cheap; However these are the observations that I made. One thing I would like to point out is their sake selection is mostly Nobu&#39;s brand which I am not too happy with, as well as the serving portions are minimal as in 3 ounces ( 89 ml ) which is similar to the amount of a sample cup you could get at your local grocer. In Japan, anywhere you go, you get 6 ounces per serving of sake which is the minimum ( 180 ml ) By the way, a regular full bottle size is 61 ounces which is 1.8 liters. I expect 10 percent from each regular bottle as a serving. Is anyone aware of &#34;Masu&#34; ? ( Masu is wooden square box/cup ) A regular sized Masu holds exactly 180 ml. A little background to Masu is, is that most restaurants ( in Japan ) think it&#39;s wrong to be stingy with the serving amount so many times a drink is served on a plate and poured so it overflows onto the plate. Which shows hospitality and symbolically persuades the customer to pay more including me. But each restaurant doesn&#39;t always serve with Masu but they would serve with a glass cup that still holds 180 ml equal to the Masu. I&#39;d most definitely return but hopefully one day their selection increases with sake that I can be happy with."

And, they didn&#39;t even ask us if we wanted dessert. And, my husband had told them twice that it was my birthday. Very disappointing experience, and very expensive. We don&#39;t mind paying more for a great experience. But, this one was not good. I emailed the restaurant and they never responded, which makes it even worse. I will not return to this restaurant.

The staff was friendly and polite but they do try to upsell you on everything.  The space is pretty, but the overall feel is a bit snooty.  Most importantly, the food:  miso black cod was superb, but a small portion; everything else was just ok, including nobu tacos, various nigiri, house roll, and softshell crab tempura with spicy garlic sauce (which was neither spicy nor garlicky).  Overall, the fish was reasonably fresh, none of the food was bad, I&#39;m glad to have tried the black cod, but none of this justified the price tag.

You can&#39;t beat the location with a nice patio with cool outdoor fireplace right on Colfax!

DECOR: this is a modern, sleek yet comfortable space. The outdoor couches looked pretty inviting in front of the fireplace - definitely the spot to hang out with a group of friends!

FOOD: new American with an international twist! We ordered a few shareable appetizers and we liked all of them especially the crunchy curried cauliflower! The sweet raisins are perfect pairings for the salty and spiced cauliflower! The Ahí tuna poke with the tempura crunch and seaweed salad was refreshingly tasty! The citrus flavor elevated the dish to another level. The flatbreads had thin crispy crust and yummy toppings like goat cheese, bacon, chicken and so on. 

SERVICE: excellent throughout our meal! The waitstaff was all very attentive and cleared out the plates so we&#39;d have more room on the table. 

VERDICT: for a group of dietetic professionals who are not easily impressed, we all left satisfied from our meal! This restaurant can be both causal or more formal if you choose to sit in the quieter booth section. The dinner menu caters to both carnivores and vegetarians at a reasonable price range! I need to come back to check out their brunch menu soon!"

Thankfully they allow you to order from the regular menu. I had a Margherita flatbread while other people in my group ordered the omelette.

The flatbread was flavorful but nothing unique. My companions said the omelette had too much going on and it affected the end result. It seemed like the restaurant was trying too hard to make the dishes fancy and thus worth the price. On the plus side the staff was great, very attentive and helpful. The restaurant looks impressive and has a great patio. It is also great to be next to Humble Pie as it makes for a great desserts destination after a nice meal.

I also tried the pork belly eggs Benedict ($14) with Texas toast, chipotle Hollandaise sauce, and breakfast potatoes. They have a chocolate chip bacon pancake dish that looked humungous. I also had some fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. They have lots of brunch cocktails like bottomless mimosas and blood marys.

I will say the curtain game is strong here, but I was distracted by the bartender measuring out liquor into a little plastic measuring cup-- that&#39;s not the picture of class and hip any joint&#39;s trying to broadcast.

I mean, the word mixologist seems silly to me, but if you usin&#39; those little tumblers an&#39; all that, that&#39;s what&#39;s up. If you&#39;re tracking every drop of gin but charging too much for food (according to Yelpers below), you gotta flip that paradigm.

And the name... Listen to Tyler Durden: &#34;Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.&#34;

Ergh. We sat at the bar and there was only one other couple there so hard to excuse how someone else&#39;s drink got on our tab, let alone that we ordered a bottle of wine and no other beverages.  Not inclined to try this spot again now, despite how much I want(ed) to try their curried cauliflower.  We had two burgers, burrata starter and a $47 bottle of wine (+ mis-billed drink) = $110 for a very &#34;meh&#34; dinner.

Pros: liked the atmosphere and large amount of bar seating; hubby liked that you could see tv&#39;s from all angles of the bar; patio seating and furnishing were very appealing; 7 pm on a Saturday and we easily found space to sit (although this should have been telling about food/service); the server had good insight on exactly how the chef cooked burgers and how we should order ours to get them as desired; meat in the burgers was good and flavor profile of topping on the lamb burger was complex and good; location fills a &#39;neighborhood locals spot&#39; gap

Cons: service was slow (took several minutes before we got menus, then only one for the two of us; we sat with empty wine glasses for a while just waiting to see how long before the server would refill from our bottle, but gave up and refilled ourselves); being charged for something we didn&#39;t order (shame on us for not checking the bill - be sure to check yours!); burrata was swimming (drowning) in a pool of balsamic

Overall: pricey meal for such a bummer experience and now just hoping CUG ups their game so people outside of walking distance are motivated to burn fuel and money for a meal here."

I had the trout sandwich which was fantastic. Delicious breaded trout, very nicely seasoned and flavored, nice roll. The accompaniment of a couple of bits of iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and a slice of onion was pretty boring and I was not thrilled with the side of an arugula salad either. Given the quality and creativity of the food, it would really be nice to have more options for sides than French fries or an arugula salad.

My friend had the octopus. It was phenomenal; probably the best either of us had ever tasted. Very tender; perfectly cooked and seasoned. Unfortunately the sauce was unpleasantly sweet. This was OK with the octopus itself as most of the sauce was on the plate, but it also came with a very odd chorizo which combined with the sauce was awful. Fortunately this was a small part of the overall dish.

The restaurant had a marvelous apricot blonde on tap from Dry Dock Brewing in Aurora, CO. The waitress said they&#39;ve offered this beer since they opened and it was definitely worth maintaining on the menu. A perfect balance with the fruit and it went very well with our meals."

Started off on the wrong foot with this place from the start.  My buddy and I sat at the bar and both ordered beers.  I noticed that for my friend&#39;s beer, the bartender pulled out an already-poured beer from the fridge, poured it into a new glass, and served it to my friend.  I thought this was sort of tacky.  Just pour a fresh beer, especially if we can see. 

My friend and I both ordered the seared tuna salad ($18), it was good, but I noticed my friend&#39;s tuna looked considerably better than mine.  I sent it back, and they took care of it, but they seemed pretty annoyed with me.  I wouldn&#39;t normally have sent it back or said anything, because it still tasted good, but I was annoyed with the whole beer situation.  

We didn&#39;t get a whole lot of attention after this.  In fact, they started doing inventory in the bar, measuring all of the liquor bottles and shining flashlights into the bottles.  They seem to keep tight control over the liquor/beer inventory levels.  Perhaps this is why the bartender felt the need to give us the beer he mistakenly poured for someone else.

Food was good, atmosphere was good, customer experience needs some work."

With that being said, all of our friends that have been here warned us they don&#39;t recommend. I can honestly say I had forgotten that until I got home from this experience and remembered our friends experiences. 

A small group  of five met her for brunch. We all commented how odd it was that for such a great sunny day that the patio and inside was empty. We quickly discovered why....

Service is S-L-O-W...I do mean slow. Not only did we have to beg for water, eating utensils and napkins but to place our order as well. I had to literally walk up to the bar to get our drinks that had been sitting there long enough for the ice to melt on a 60 degree day. 

It was like a weird time warp in that all the servers I spoke to had a weird smile and would ask how things were and when told &#34;not good&#34; they kept the same smile and said &#34;thank you&#34;. It was like talking to a programmed robot!

Space is great...food ok and service horrific!"

It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining and the patio was playing some great tunes. We decided to check it out. I am glad we did. Our waiter was great. He gave us some suggestions on the drinks. For my boyfriend, he loves to try new beers, so the recommendations were perfect, from the tangerine ale to the double hopps beer. Me on the other hand, I prefer a good cocktail.. I went for the strawberry, mint, bourbon drink.. WOW.. it was perfect on a nice spring day, fresh strawberry and mint garnish. 

We decided to split a salad and a burger. We got the wedge salad.. It was beyond Amazing. The yogurt dressing should be bottled and sold,, but the real star is the smoked grapes... They are a trip. It is hard to describe them other then it tastes like you are eating a piece of meat, but it is a grape. Mixed with pickled apples and walnuts. It was wonderful.

As we were enjoying the salad, the waiter came with the burger. Cooked perfect. We ordered the burger with the horseradish and caramelized onions and bacon. It was moist, juicy and seasoned perfect.  The Fries were good, pickled just the slightest so give that sweet taste to go with the spiced up ketchup. 

As we were finishing the Manager came over to greet us and ask us how our experience was. He was very pleasant and outgoing. We are looking forward to going back and trying some of the other items on the menu that sound so wonderful"

I even left my phone number and name....I literally never tell someone not to go somewhere but this place was absolutely the worst. Even while trying to talk to the manager informing that cash was paid, he was very standoff-ish! If you want to feel like you are a crook while you are being robbed then this is the place for you!

Overall, the experience was alright. Nothing special but nothing horrible either. 

I went with my mom and we went through the bar entrance which was a mistake because it took slightly longer for us to get seated. It was really busy outside (which is where we wanted to sit) and we were told it would be 30 minutes before something opened up. Since we were hungry, we sat inside where it was empty. The food is fine. I got some sort of chicken burger and an arugula salad. The salad was very tasty and the sandwich was okay. The prices were high for what we paid. I feel better that my mom and I only split the salad and the sandwich and each didn&#39;t order something. 

The people are friendly and the manager introduced himself. The server was attentive and nice and a little more talkative than I was expecting (we were the only ones there, he might&#39;ve just been really bored XD). 

Overall, it&#39;s a solid choice for dinner, it&#39;s just not anything super special."

The service is decent, the food is actually pretty good. But the prices are near extortion in this part of Colfax. I have grown to really dislike this place based on sticker shock alone. $9 a shot for a decent whiskey is really ridiculous (and higher than every other place in the area) so I don&#39;t have to drink Beam (Swill). $15 for 4 wings (regardless if they are duck) is just not worth it, tasty, but you end up doing math at the end and wondering if it was really worth a new game on Steam. I was so unimpressed with the rest of the place (it seemed like it was trying way too hard to be lodo in a very residential neighborhood) that I asked that we stop going back. I have a feeling it will go the way of the Park House (who also started so strong and then cut corners on food) eventually anyways as who serves shepherd&#39;s pie (with GROUND BEEF instead of traditional lamb) who isn&#39;t trying to cut corner&#39;s? 

Simply, there are better, more affordable places around. The food just isn&#39;t worth the &#34;high-end hipster&#34; tax. and is apparently starting to go downhill.

Unfortunately both those dishes were disappointing. The flatbread was soggy and bland and the poke was also bland. We were hoping for a place that was more reasonably priced however the cheapest entree on the menu was a burger for $17. In fairness, this was the restaurants first week of opening so  maybe they need some time to work through these issues."

The burger was flavored well but just to moist/greasy.  The fries were both soggy and crispy... not sure how that happens.  The salad was soaked in dressing.  Luckily the dressing had a mild flavor so it was still edible.  The biggest gripe was really the table.  We were right next to the hostess station so we constantly had hosts/servers looking across our table to assess the other patrons.  Plus, we were right on the main walkway.  Think sitting just outside the kitchen plus worse.  Gave 2 stars for over priced average food with not so great service or table.  If I&#39;d been there for after dinner drinks, the rating would probably be better.  (Bartenders seemed top notch and patio was really nice.)"

I expected the neighborhood to gain dining concepts offering maybe one or two of these things over the coming years, but then Chow popped up out of nowhere and left nothing to be desired. I&#39;ve been in twice and it&#39;s plainly apparent that their chef takes great pride in his work and their management and servers really care about the service they&#39;re providing. After dining at many restaurants during their opening weeks, I have to say the lack of &#39;hiccups&#39; during my visits really does say a lot about the team that they assembled. Hopefully(for locals) Chow remains a hidden gem where you can just walk in, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if, once word gets out, it becomes a &#39;reservations encouraged&#39; kind of place."

The first meal was great - good portion sizes, balanced flavors, and despite the prices, left me satisfied enough to recommend it as a new favorite. Not so tonight. The tuna poke appetizer had generous portions of fish &amp; avocado, but the sauce had too much spice that overwhelmed the tuna. If I&#39;m paying for fish, I want to taste it, not the sauce. The banh mi sandwich with pork belly was satisfying, although the side fries were undercooked. Overall, meh meal."

The place was very clean, from entrance to the booth we sat in, which is always nice to see.

The food was just okay.  The green chili wasn&#39;t very flavorful, and with my burrito smothered in it, sort of dulled out the flavors.  The meat was tasty, and the portions were large, and perfectly-sized for a bigger guy like myself.

Pricing wasn&#39;t bad, and for the meal it only slightly dented the wallet.

Until my meal was interrupted by a man on drugs who attacked an employee until the police showed up. The situation was handled well buuuuuut I think I&#39;ll order to-go next time! ;) 

Hot Sauces:

MEDIUM: A well balanced complex sauce, It&#39;s almost a chip-dippable. You experience the heat more immediately as opposed to as an aftertaste. 

HOT: A slightly smoky habanero sauce. Adds some heat without changing the flavor of your food too much. The spice is more in the aftertaste. 

AVOCADO: A fairly thin, slightly dull avocado sauce with a hint of lime. Would prefer it thicker. It&#39;s good but not my fav. 

On a side-note, their California Burrito is all wrong. A true California Burrito has carne asada with guac, pico de gallo, and French fries. And usually sour cream."

Ok, that said, it is a solid place.  As noted by others, food tastes homemade.  I had a very good relleno and a couple street tacos.  Rerfrieds were maybe the best I&#39;ve ever had, creamy and smoky.  Staff was very nice and accommodating, letting you taste the different salsa options.  You do go through a line like Chipotle but this is WAY better so can&#39;t even really compare them."

Always a fan of that.  Thanks Bocaza!

Everything was great until Cat found a hair in her burrito.  I guess it wouldn&#39;t have been that bad but when she brought it up to the counter three employees claimed they didn&#39;t see it, making an unnecessary scene.  Then Cat pulled the light colored hair out and one lady said to put it on her finger and claimed she didn&#39;t see it, the dropped it, then showed her empty finger to the other people.  Of course she didn&#39;t see it any more because it fell off.  After the scene they offered to make her something else - but at that point she just spent five minutes arguing a point and being made a fool of, so everything felt unappetizing.  The guacamole was OK - but Cat didn&#39;t want to eat any more :("

Went here with Hubs on Wednesday July 4th 2012.  Thankfully while we were there, we are the last patrons since they decide to close early due to the July 4th Celebration.  Time was about 19:35hrs ish.

We ordered our food/beverages at the counter.

We opt for these items from the Menu :

*  Steak Tacos ($5.59)
*  Steak Burrito Smothered with Sour Cream ($5.59) + ($1.09) + ($0.50)
*  2 Bottled Drinks ($1.75) each hence ($3.50)
*  Large Fountain Drink for Hubs ($1.49)

The staff behind the counter was indeed accommodating and inviting.  While at the counter ordering, we can opt the kind of ingredients to be put in our order.  There is a SELF-Service salsa/sauce counter available in which I so wish the salsa or the sauces provided could be spicy for my personal taste bud.

Our food came out piping hot and made to order, the service was fast.  As for the food, its A-OKAY for our taste bud.  I so wish the Tacos I had to have more flavor.  Since both our order contain &#34;Steak&#34;, as the main protein, it seems what they put in the Tacos tasted similar to the Steak Burrito.  To return, its a maybe when time and schedule permitting.  We left at 20:10hrs after a full belly in our tummy.

My favorite is their chille relleno with green chile sauce covered over it.... The bomb. They have a variety of meats to choose from for your taco or burrito needs. Keep in mind this is not your dollar taco place it is a little pricier but the quality is worth it."

The food is fresh, perfectly seasoned, and reasonably priced. Not only that, the service is excellent and even with their long lines they manage to treat their customers well and serve them in no time. Yes, there are the too-americanized, yellow-cheese, all-smothered offerings to cater to the taste of the region (I guess!) but there are also some authentic Mexican menu items that are prepared just like they would at  restaurant this size in Mexico... not to mention the delicious desserts!

The counter is manned by friendly staff that will offer you a variety of solid options to enhance your taco building experience to your individual taste. I recommend the green tomato salsa, which is in the medium range when it comes to spicy providing an excellent taste and a comfortable amount of heat. My mutant co-worker would have none of this and opted for some uber spicy stuff that is involved in pepper spray testing; proving that not only do they possess a variety of toppings but have a nice selection of &#39;heat&#39; options to suit all needs.

It was a cold and snowy day and we were able to warm up with some beers and food at the bar while watching some good football.  This trip was another great experience and we were able to enjoy the upstairs roof top seating as we came on an unusually warm day in November.

We arrived around noon on a Friday, starving after coming from a flight from SF we were in need of beer and food.  The hostess sat us at a high top with some sunshine and the server greeted us pretty quick to grab us some beers and food.  We grabbed a few local beers, brussels sprouts, and a chip/dip trio (tortilla chips, guac, salsa and queso).  The experience was enjoyable.

We were in the mood for burgers, and this place has an amazing whiskey selection and super reasonable prices, so it was the logical choice. Unfortunately, the food did not impress. 

I have to give these guys credit, because the service was excellent. They went above and beyond...truly. I ordered a bison burger medium rare with BBQ sauce (no idea what it was called and don&#39;t feel like looking it up). I was craving fries as well, so I got the regular french fries. When my burger came out, I knew something wasn&#39;t right after the first bite. It was well done (which translates to DRY with lean bison), and didn&#39;t have cheese on it. I notified the waiter, and he immediately rectified the situation. The manager came over and apologized, and they comped my meal, which I didn&#39;t feel was necessary, but I obviously appreciated. 

My second burger was better, but was still lacking a bit for me. The fries were really dry and overcooked. Essentially, my entire meal was dry and overcooked. My boyfriend liked his burger, but was not wowed. That said, I appreciated their excellent service, I still have an unused Passbook coupon, and I would definitely give them another try.

Mmmmm bacon. Or as they call it man candy Mmmmm I ordered a bloody Mary with bacon and I want this recipe. It was spicy, delicious, bacon it was great. They also had bottomless mimosas. The beers my family had were great too.  In  house printed kiddie menus were delivered promptly with crayons. 3 happy kids made us 4 happy adults.

I had the truffle burger and it was wow. Cooked perfect and so juicy. Most places have mushroom and Swiss here they went over the top with a fried egg and arugula. It&#39;s messy but worth it. I stayed true to truffles and had the truffle fries. They were crispy and flavorful. 

The ambiance was great too! Rustic and friendly.

I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s good or bad for you the reader but read on you shall because I have hooked you in!  HA!

I came here on a trip with my compadres for our annual baseball trip and it was a complete accident.  Other places before Sunday&#39;s game were packed so we just walked in here.  When we arrived they were serving their brunch menu which I was happy to see as I wasn&#39;t wanting a burger.  We started off with drinks, being a son of New Orleans I was stocked to see a Sazerac on the menu.  The drink was made well except they put the drink in a martini glass.  Seriously???  It felt wrong, it almost ruined my experience.  How dare these mountain people emasculate my drink in such a way.  I can&#39;t drink my Sazerac with my pinky out!

Luckily the rest of my experience was so amazing that I was able to over look such a travesty! I ordered some sort of spare rib hash. I came with some rib roast over these perfectly fried fluffy pillows of heaven potatoes with an over easy egg and poblano peppers.  This was the ultimate hangover cure.  My buddies were talking about the wonders of their food too but I was in my own little happy world and didn&#39;t pay attention.

The service was spot on.  Our young waitress handled us 3 middle aged smart asses with ease and did a phenomenal job.  At one point in our meal my compadre asked her for the check from another table that consisted of Air Force cadets.  He&#39;s a retired Air Force guy himself but he didn&#39;t want them to know he paid.  Apparently the manager ( I assume it was the manager, they wouldn&#39;t tell us who it was) found out what he did and comped our meal for him being kind despite our protest. ( we still had to pay for the drinks but still amazing).   The entire staff seemed to stop by and tell us how great we were for the gesture.  

Phenomenal food, service and atmosphere.  Just put the Sazerac in it&#39;s proper Old Fashioned glass and you will be perfect."

The upstairs patio is awesome, so glad it was a perfect Colorado summer day for it too. I&#39;ve been in here for a drink before, but only about 20 minutes at the bar downstairs. I ordered the Avocado Bacon cheeseburger with a side of sweet potato tots. Outstanding! I would highly recommend their burgers to anyone, it was simply delicious. 

Our waiter was fantastic, though I sadly do not remember his name. He was quick to take care of us, and left me feeling very welcomed to the restaurant. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more delicious items on their menu! That short rib grilled cheese sandwich is calling my name...."

I&#39;m not a huge burger person in the first place but I ate this entire thing and it was huge! I could have done without all of the arugula on top, it was almost the size of a side salad!! The bison was very juicy and lean. I especially liked their sweet buns. The bottom bun got a little soggy but that is to be expected with a fried egg on any burger. Each person at our table tried a different side. I had the green chili mac n cheese and it was very good! I would only order it as a side or it&#39;s too much cheese at one time. The sweet potato tots were so good! Had brown sugar in the mix because they were more sweet than salty. The classic french fries were very good. Not too salty or greasy. Just right! And the chili fries had an amazing flavor! I think it&#39;s worth it to upgrade to a nicer side for $1 and we taste tested a few! We didn&#39;t order drinks but they had a nice wine selection. Definitely returning here to try some other great burgers."

If not, the restaurant ambiance itself is nice; like an upscale sports bar vibe. Service is super fast and friendly, but expect some wait time if you&#39;re dining right before a baseball game!! 

I ordered the hangover burger and was blown away by the sheer size of it! Picture two potato buns sandwiching a crispy hash brown, generous bacon slices, a fried egg, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, and a juicy patty. It&#39;s a ton of food so make sure you&#39;re starving when you order!! I also upgraded to the Brussels sprouts as my side. They were phenomenal. Extremely well cooked and deliciously flavored.

NO! We waited maybe fifteen minutes at prime-time dinner time! We were fine with sitting outside which sped up our wait time ;) I loved everything about their rooftop patio. Beautiful views of downtown Denver and the cleanest air that you can imagine. I am from Louisville Kentucky were allergies are number one in the world and the air holds a mildew smell and feel.

This reminded me of my favorite restaurant back home, Mussel and Burger Bar. Burgers and cocktails are the specialties in this slice of burger heaven! I wanted to try the bacon cocktail and ended up LOVING IT! 

After much deliberation and many questions to our sweet server, I decided on the PB &amp; JJ Burger with a peanut butter aioli and jalapeño - raspberry jam. I am a HUGE fan of the weird and explainable. I think it&#39;s pretty delicious (although my personal preference is to hold the cheddar.)  

My sweet travel sauce ordered a pizza to split! We also shared the delicious PB &amp; JJ BURGER! The wood fired pizzas also are an amazing choice. Our favorite was the Fig &amp; Pig- prosciutto, fig jam, arugula, and fresh mozzarella. With a sweet and savory flavor, you can&#39;t go wrong with this pizza!

It&#39;s not bad except the dressing created a little pool on the plate - too runny! 

The Wake Up Call Burger (a.k.a. the coffee burger) wasn&#39;t as smoky as the name suggested, I could barely discern the coffee! And it was kind of dry. The Pork Belly Burger sounded like it would be juicier but all that piece of pork belly doing sitting there was looking day-old. I recall the fries were good and so were the burger buns; also enjoyed the steamed brussel sprouts. Our server was very sweet to split a burger order into 2 after hearing us decide to share it."

-Ignite fries
-Loaded chicken tenders
-Mahalo Burger (this was my entree I split with my friend. Comes with pineapple and jalapeno cream cheese, as well as some bomb fries! SO good) 
-Moscow mules ($5 on happy hour and so refreshing. I had two throughout the night because I liked them so much)

It&#39;s upstairs and outside seating is prime real estate to have a beer and watch the sun go down - especially those nights the sky looks like fire over the ball field. Did I mention the free beer with a yelp check in? 

I think one minor disconnect you&#39;ll find is if they are a restaurant, a bar, or sports bar. They have a few flatscreen tvs but the main room is SO huge and the tvs are so high up on the walls that you cannot really see what&#39;s happening on them. You&#39;ll probably discover if you ask for their business plan that they were hoping to be all three. 

So if you&#39;re looking for a place to come watch a game, it may not be the place you&#39;re looking for. But if I mentioned the free beer on check in you may get passed the obstacles and come anyway. 

Thanks ignite for the generous giveaway and please bring back 2-for-1 burger Tuesday&#39;s."

I&#39;ve honestly been too bewildered and angry to come back to this, which is why it&#39;s taken me so long. My waiter the first night completely messed up, meaning he gave me false information about weather or not a particular product contained gluten. By particular product, I mean the pizza I was raving about in my previous review. I will preface this by divulging that I had ordered the steak and my husband had ordered the GLUTEN FREE pizza. Key word there. It didn&#39;t look like gluten free pizza, or smell like it, or taste like it, which all stem from the fact that it WASN&#39;T. But given the fact that I had heard my husband order it gluten free (they did have normal pizza too though), I decided to ask the waiter, with the idea in mind to filch a piece for myself. I asked our waiter what was in it, to which he replied &#34;Why, is there something wrong with it?&#34; I said no, and that it looked too perfect to be gluten free. The waiters response was a 10 minute explanation of the process of how they make their gluten free dough in house, let it rise, all that. How all the gluten free breads in house were made that way. How they were the best in town. I had to try the bread. Yes, this guy actually went to the kitchen and brought me one of their house made gluten free buns. It was good, his energy was good, I was sold on the outstanding quality of their bread. So naturally, I ended up filching that piece of pizza. And then a second. It was so wrong.... but not right at all, because of some waiter&#39;s flub. Was he just trying to cover his own rear with his enthusiastic reassurance that the pizza had not a shred of gluten within it? Perhaps. But the problem is that his lie, or lack of knowledge, or the kitchen&#39;s screw up or WHATEVER it is that actually happened caused me serious health problems later. But wait. How could I possibly know that the pizza my husband had ordered wasn&#39;t gluten free as promised? Because I am a serial restaurant visitor, and I had to go back for more the next day. First of all, the real gluten free crust tasted, felt and smelled 100% different-- it really wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. Second, I must say, the fig and prosciutto version of their pizza was drowning in arugula (its a pizza guys... gross), ultra beyond salty without that spark of sweetness it needs to really pop, and honestly, just overall not good. The version with the sausage on it was actually good... but also glutenous, unfortunately. I am aware that as someone with Celiac&#39;s I probably shouldn&#39;t be taking the gamble of eating out anywhere, especially considering the likelihood of human error, this case being a perfect example. Can I hold any one person accountable for this mistake? No. I can&#39;t even hold the restaurant accountable in reality, so please don&#39;t read this as a flaming, horrible review of Ignite itself. Consider this re-review an objective, 100% honest account of my 2 experiences there. Folks with allergies, be mindful. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: If you want a gluten free pizza that actually tastes like a real damn pizza, go here. My faith in the possibilities of delicious, fluffy, chewy, PERFECT pizza that won&#39;t make me sick are restored because of Ignite. The difference is that they give their gluten free dough time to rise, and it seriously makes all the difference. Their buns are also perfect. Their gluten free baking set up is seriously on point. 

Their steak is tasty, I love the sweet potato tots and crispy brussels too! Their gluten free options are seriously awesome, and if you dont have an allergy or have a friend who doesnt, they offer a free draft beer when you check in with the Yelp app, too! Its a really great deal. 

My waiter was knowledgeable about the food he was serving, and friendly. The atmosphere was nice for a group outing or a date. I really loved the food and the establishment both, and will be back!"

I think I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s best to stick with a restaurant&#39;s speciality- at Ignite Burgers &amp; Bar, the specialties are... burgers and bar food!  I&#39;d consider Ignite&#39;s menu items to be playful, upscale versions of your typical bar food.  I have to admit, the PB&amp;JJ Burger with a peanut butter aioli and jalapeño - raspberry jam sounds kind of weird, but I think it&#39;s pretty delicious (although my personal preference is to hold the cheddar.)  The wood fired pizzas also are a solid choice.  My favorite is the Fig &amp; Pig- prosciutto, fig jam, arugula, and fresh mozzarella.  It&#39;s the perfect combination of both sweet and savory.

And for the bar food... yum.  They offer a few of their appetizers for $5 a pop during happy hour.  This includes the truffle fries, crispy brussels sprouts, and jalapeño deviled eggs.  All good choices.  However, if you MUST choose only one appetizer, it MUST be the man candy.  Sweet and spicy bacon- flavorful, decadent, and memorable.  You&#39;ll love it- I promise.

I also must mention the atmosphere.  Ignite is home to a rooftop patio with both covered and open air areas.  The views of downtown and the ballpark are pretty darn amazing.  I also do love their downstairs area too- high ceilings, a large, open bar area, and comfy booths.  I&#39;m pretty happy dining in either spot here."

And our server was awesome. The hostess and female manager not so much. I was meeting 2 other people there and did not know if they were there already. I had never been there before and didn&#39;t know the restaurant layout so I Asked the blond hostess who worked Friday lunch  if 2 other women had arrived who said they were expecting a third. She was distracted, by what I don&#39;t know because there were only 3 tables occupied downstairs and she is the hostess, not a server. She never made eye contact and said for me to go look for them.  I said maybe they went upstairs?  She said &#34;go look&#34;. I was wearing heels and it is about 40 steps to get upstairs. If my friends were not there hen I&#39;d have to come back down and then go back up when they arrived. Then the short dark haired manager came over to help the hostess (??) not me. And told me I could go up. I tried to explain I was waiting for other guests then she and the hostess started talking to me at the same time so I did not hear either of them. I decided to just text my friends and let them know where I was instead of any more of this painful conversation.  

I think they advertise their super tall burgers. None of ours were big at all. It was maybe a third pound burger. I ordered medium rare and got medium. You are a &#34;burger&#34; bar, you should excel in those and temperatures. We had to ask for more sauce for our burger because there was barely any of the main ingredient for that particular burger. The Brussels sprouts were way too salty and the chili paste took away from ever being able to taste truffle oil.  Not a good combo idea. Or maybe it is, that attempt was just not executed well. Again, The server was super nice and attentive."

Good was great. Drinks were good as well. Out server Liz was awesome making sure we didn&#39;t go dry. The jalapeño cream cheese was amazing. Needed a quick crunch factor. Friend I was with really really enjoyed the PB&amp;J slider. It was good! Little more heat would have been good. Maybe spice of the jam more? The bacon - wow!!!!! And that bison burger was amazing. 

Totally recommend this spot.

The location is ideal for people wanting to grab a bite prior to a baseball game and the atmosphere is hip and relaxed. We had a couple of beers, nothing too special, and tried the slider burgers. They were good... about as good as any other burger place in town. We also tried the Man Candy (bacon with brown sugar maple type glaze topped with red pepper flakes, I think) and those were delicious. I would go again for those, but not just for a burger."

We had heard that they had excellent juicy burgers and had to give them a try. We were seated and handed the menu. Immediately we saw man candy on the menu. Basically, it was some candied spicy bacon. We started with an order of that and then moved on to the burgers. I ordered the classic with cheese.  This is my go to for trying burgers at a new place.  If they can&#39;t make a good basic burger, then I pretty much don&#39;t need to go back. The burger looked like a tower.  It was so tall! I bit into the burger (which was difficult since it was so large) and it began dripping all over the plate. It was messy and delicious.  I fell in love. This was then put into my top 5 best burgers I have ever had. It was so juicy and packed full of flavor.  This made for a great Valentine&#39;s Day. I will be back to try other burgers on the menu."

We went today for a company lunch and I was so happy I wasn&#39;t spending my own money here.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish tacos which were bland and the smallest serving I&#39;ve ever seen.

She has Celiac disease and is hugging the toilet 90 mins after ingesting a decent amount of gluten. Since we have been together, almost 4 years, she has only had 2 incidents and this was one of them. We were promised that the calamari was gluten-free since it was crusted with corn and nuts. Well, the toilet says otherwise. Sure enough, she was sick 90 mins later. The staff needs to understand the implications of giving out false information.

Again, the food is pretty good and a great rooftop. Service is so-so and they made a unforgiveable error."

Solid place to go before a ballgame. They have a good happy hour menu with half off all appetizers and $5 drinks. We got the steak and cheese egg roll appetizer which was delicious and the best tasting thing we got. We also ordered the mahi mahi tacos, which were good, but nothing too special. I wish the waiter had told me not to order cole slaw as my side as there was a bunch of cole slaw in the tacos themselves. We also got the hangover burger, which had hashbrowns, fried egg, tomato, and lettuce on it. It was very tasty. The service was really great, our waiter was super attentive and even the kitchen staff were very friendly and helpful."

This place should spend less time trying to plate their food to look trendy and more time trying to make their food delicious. I ordered a bacon avocado burger with truffle fries. The bacon wasn&#39;t all that good. The burger wasn&#39;t juicy,  and the bun was larger than the burger. The truffle fries were disappointing at best. I&#39;ve had truffle fries many places,  and these were a letdown. I also ordered a dessert that was a cookie ice cream sandwich. The waitress brought out a different flavor than I had ordered. The cookie itself was so hard I couldn&#39;t use my fork to cut it. I determined that I would not use my teeth on it either. The waitress was busy because they were crowded due to it being trivia nigh,  so service was rather slow. The mid twenty something table in front of me amused me by having no knowledge of classic songs that anyone who has ever spent any time listening to a radio should have heard enough times to be instantly recognizable. On the plus side,  after I explained to the waitress how inedible the dessert was, it was removed from my bill. For what they charged for their burger,  I was expecting a much better burger experience."

I received a call from my bank that he did Bill the card.

AMAZING FOOD. Happy hour apps are amazing! Our server was Laura, and she knew exactly was to recommend when we told her what we were looking for. She was knowledgeable and such a great time! She made the experience better! She got in our second round of drinks right before happy hour ended and really wanted us to have a great experience - and we did! Even the leftovers we are later were amazing! We were in Denver for three days and ate here two out of the three days!

Front girls aren&#39;t as nice - they told us it was a 20 minute wait, then the wait turned into over an hour and instead of them coming up to us while we wait and letting us know, we went up to them and asked what was going on. Tables were empty and so many people were waiting. They should really touch base with people waiting and keep us updated, because people are hungry and waiting."

I had heard about the man candy, and after doing some research and discovered they offered bottomless mimosas, we were sold. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately, and our server was adorably pregnant and extremely attentive. Our mimosas were never empty!

Not completely sold on the esthetics of this place (a little too commercial feeling for my tastes) I was a little skeptical, but one look at the menu and I was very pleased.  I pretty much could&#39;ve ordered anything on the menu and my tastebuds would&#39;ve been satisfied. I finally settled on the Ignite hash, and it was delicious.  My friends ordered the green chili mac and the breakfast burrito and loved them. My boyfriend ordered the veggie scramble and it looked fabulous as well.  This place really nailed the playing as well, so my eyes were just as full and satisfied as my tummy at the end of the meal.

We had fairly large groups both times we went in here and the hostess handled things very well - for dinner we realized that our sizable group wasn&#39;t going to fit in the dining room so management and the hostess helped us out by sending us upstairs...great move for sure! The rooftop is the spot to be at Ignite. 

They have a great selection of brews, food, and even a Mantini - that&#39;s a thing. I had margherita pizza and it definitely did not disappoint! Brunch was fantastic here as well - get there and make sure you hit the rooftop on a sun-filled, mimosas-on-Sunday kind of afternoon. You&#39;ll definitely enjoy that for sure!

Quick note - if you make reservations, the rooftop is not available. This is first come first serve so we ended up waiting 20mins for our table.

The bar - we waited at the bar for our table and usually I find bartenders to be super quick. I asked for a water before the other two in my party ordered their alcoholic beverages and he didn&#39;t grab it. I get that it&#39;s just a water but I don&#39;t drink so it&#39;s usually all I get. It took us asking another time for water and then a few minute wait before I got any.

The food - really good! I would recommend the man candy and the Brussels sprouts. It was such a fun combo for apps. I had never had such sweet bacon! It was so yummy! I got the California and my sister got the Mahalo - both were really goods In addition, we had the truffle fries and sweet potato tots. These were surprisingly good. I wasn&#39;t sure what I expected but they exceeded expectations.

I would definitely come back to sit on the patio, the view can&#39;t be beat! I&#39;m not sure though if I would take the time to sit inside. The best part is the deck."

Now I know I don&#39;t need to tell you this but free beer. Should I end my review there? 
I will proceed. I have had pizza, mac and cheese and burgers when I have gone here. It was all multiple times not in one sitting. That wouldn&#39;t be possible because the burgers are huge! Most of the time I can just eat half and be full. The place has always had a wait and been busy when I have went so I recommend a reservation.

The rest of the meal was good, but the PB and JJ was not as good as last time my friend got the Ignite Pizza and I&#39;m definitely going to order that next time.

The service was unfortunately really slow, the main floor of the restaurant wasn&#39;t full so I&#39;m not sure why it was so slow.  After waiting awhile to order our drinks we had to wait over 15 minutes to get the drinks that we ordered and then we had to wait a few more minutes to order our food. The apps and the food didn&#39;t take too long, but after our food was brought out, the waitress who brought us our plates proceeded to grab ketchup and mustard and walk past us to another table. We had to wait at least another 10 minutes to get the attention of someone to get the ketchup for the fries.

The bartender was clearly overwhelmed while several tables throughout the restaurant remained open with available wait staff.  It was 45 minutes before I got asked for an order.  If it was not for the fact that I was very hungry I would have walked out. The food is good but does not make up for the inadequate service.

A reservation was made as we were a large group, probably 20+ people.  The reservation was at 6:30.  We arrived at 6:30, not everyone was there, probably 8 people at this point.  The tables were set and ready to go, but we were not allowed to go sit and start eating/drinking because there was not enough of us yet.  Finally let us sit down around 6:45.
The biggest issue became apparent right away.  For a group of 20+ people, we had 2 waitresses.  And not 2 waitresses that were just for our group, but that were also serving other tables.  One appeared to be in training and one appeared to be the trainer.  So apparently, the way they thought you should train someone was to make the person in training do all the work while you stand and watch over their shoulder.  So, basically one waitress for our whole group plus other tables.  As you can imagine, this made it take FOREVER.  We wanted to order food, but couldn&#39;t because they wanted to finish drink orders for guests who had just walked in first.  We weren&#39;t allowed to order food until about 7:15.
Again, the waitress in training took all of the orders with the other waitress looking over her shoulder, taking forever.  Then the waitress in training put in all the orders by herself, again, with no help from the other waitress.  I would say we got our food around 8?
I attempted multiple times after I finished eating at get the attention of our waitresses, to no avail, I am pretty sure they were ignoring our group at this point.  I wanted to get the check for my portion and leave.  I know large groups aren&#39;t fun, but if you don&#39;t want them there, and are going to ignore them, then don&#39;t allow reservations for large groups.  Simple as that.  Finally after about 15 minutes of hoping a waitress would come close enough for me to get her attention, I gave up and asked someone else in the group to pay for my food and I would pay them back.  I have no clue at what time everyone finally got their bills and settled up, I had left at that point.  I can&#39;t imagine it was quick.
Last problem, I couldn&#39;t get out of the restaurant.  They packed everyone in so tightly that I actually had to ask someone to get up from their seat and move so that I could exit the restaurant.  If a Fire Marshall had walked in, it would not have gone over well.  I cannot imagine they were within their allowed capacity.  Sorry fellow patron, please stop eating and get up so I can leave the restaurant.  Not cool.
The food is okay.  Not wonderful, not worth the bad service and crowd.  
Won&#39;t be going back."

Wellll, the menu looked so good when we got there that neither of us ended up ordering it, teehee. He got the fish tacos, which were delicious, but there were only 2 and they were very small for the price. There was also so much of the sauce on there that it soaked the tortilla and made it soggy and a little messy to eat. 

I got the Bacon Avocado burger with fries and it was EXCELLENT. The fries are seasoned nicely and it was a perfect portion. 

We also had the jalapeño deviled eggs for an appetizer, and they were very good as well, but we won&#39;t be getting them again because we felt kind of ridiculous spending $5 on four deviled eggs. 

The Bloody Mary&#39;s were $7 apiece and watery, so we won&#39;t be ordering those again either. 

Overall: decent prices on some items, hefty on others, wonderful atmosphere, friendly and responsive service. We&#39;ll be back!"

Came out fast and fresh and holy hell they were good. She&#39;s a GM of a large Asian restaurant that has fantastic calamari, and she thought it was the best she&#39;d ever had.

Cool open dining room with exposed brick, helpful attentive staff. Young but not overly trendy clientele. 


We&#39;ve found a new watering hole when in Denver.

EDIT: I wrote this before our entree came. She ordered the flat iron steak, I had the chopped Cobb. Both were insanely tasty. The Brussel Sprouts in her flat iron were amongst the best I&#39;ve had.

I see a lot of negative reviews on service? These guys are on point. Our service was great and we were well taken care of. Came in for early lunch Sunday Jan 4th. The place was freezing. All the guests including us stayed in hats and Coates. I asked the waiter &#34;what&#39;s up&#34;. He says it&#39;s on full blast but because of the big front windows you can&#39;t get the place warm? Invest in a few powerful heaters guys! We ate with our coats on. Now the food has excellent presentation and is all good. I will say it&#39;s expensive though. $10-$13 for a burger, but it does come with fries! Fries were awesome!! They just couldn&#39;t seem to get our order right and the place was VERY empty. Ordered a cheese burger (no cheese), ordered medium and wife ordered well , they mixed up the patties? Pointed it out to the waiter who said &#34;Yep, they sure did mix em up&#34;. He offered to start over with the burgers. We said it was okay, besides we were freezing and hungry. Lol.. Bottom line 3 burgers, an appetizer and 2 teas came to $64 before tip. I like this place, but having a difficult time justifying a return."

I had a salmon salad that really satisfied my hunger and had no expectation to go for dessert.... until the bartender/server I was chatting with told me about their smores. What a treat that was! 

Because I enjoyed my experience there the first night so much, I returned the following night. Once again my dinner was exceptional, but that wasn&#39;t the only thing that I was so wonderful. My server (a different one than the previous night) had noticed that I wasn&#39;t having such a good day, and when I asked for the check she said not to worry, that it was on her because we all have those days. 

I hope to return to this incredible restaurant the next time I&#39;m passing through Denver. Thanks to all the staff there for making my day!"

Dinner, get the burger (really any burger you won&#39;t be disappointed). The Brussel sprouts here are delicious, a little bit on the sweet side but great none the less.

Brunch is a must here. Not only do they do bottomless mimosas, they have a great rooftop patio, but the food is phenomenal. The waffles with the seasonal fruit on top (think strawberry goodness on top) is always a crowd pleaser.

Divey diner setting with ambitious restaurant pricing? The gyro sandwich has a brand based and promoted out of Chicago. I&#39;m not sure if that makes it more authentic but definitely means it is not fresh or local. It wasn&#39;t awesome- just ok.

I see similar promotions from hotdog carts who brand name drop trying to add street cred to their inferior encased meats but this is a restaurant that claims to be authentic. It was $10 with fries. Add $2.50 for a 20oz coke in a plastic bottle - that&#39;s lame!

The nice lady owner actively engaged in social conversations with her opinions and political commentary. Eye roll - homely and unrefined business sensibilities here.

We have really good Greek places in Denver so lots of better options nearby with more menu variety, a better vibe, and cheaper. I&#39;ll pass on this place next time."

Parking is, of course, a bitch on that stretch of South Broadway (but where isn&#39;t it these days)?

Place is an old fashioned kind of typical South Broadway dive - dated decor - TV blaring - sticky floors - etc.  Nice older YaYa waiting tables - looked to be a real mom/pop situation.  We were the only customers so service wasn&#39;t an issue.  Very limited standard Greek menu but expensive.  The lunch special today was lamb and rice $19.

My issue was that the food was pretty ordinary but so pricy for a little diner.  She had a gyros sandwich and rice $10 and a beer ($5) - I had the appetizer sampler - $19 and water.  She thought the sandwich was OK but nothing special and my very expensive sampler was a real yawn.  A couple of room temp soggy spanakopita, 3 falafel (way dark and falling apart), some hummus, tzaziki, and 3 dolmas which appeared not homemade (1 store bought pita on the side).  Totally MEH.  Both Pete&#39;s and Byblos are FAR better and less expensive plus both have much more interesting menus.

So, lunch tab was $39 + tip - won&#39;t be going back here.  We could have had lunch for the same price at Gozo next door and next time we will."

I live far enough away that it isn&#39;t worth driving back to return the food.

We both had Greek beer called Fix, the lady who waited on us said Fix was the beer she used to have back in Greece as a young girl, and that&#39;s pretty much all they had... So I tried it. Loved it, light and crisp. 

Had the sampler appetizer. OMG... Loved it. The falafel, dolmas, and tzatziki were my favorite. 

My husband ordered the Greek salad with the Gyro meat. This has been the best Gyro meat I&#39;ve ever had. It was definitely top notch. I&#39;d go again and just have that. My husband raved about the entire salad in general: huge portions of tomatoes and lots of feta and meat. 

I had the patitiso and feel totally full, total pasta comfort food right there.

I came here randomly the other day before my move to the other side of town, with no food in the house, and a growly tummy, and a grumpy attitude towards everything else I have tried in the neighborhood, I decided to give this cute little blue place a try.

I walked in and was greeted by a very friendly, warm woman and an amazing smell of Greek Cuisine. She informed me before I ordered that unfortunately they could only take cash because their credit card machine was down. I scavenged for every quarter in the bottom of my purse and managed to just barely afford a gyro. She kindly took my change and apologized about the inconvenience. 

I took a seat and a few minutes later it came, I took it home to get some work done while I devoured it, but it barely made it home it smelled so good.

The pita was so fresh, the meat was so tender, the sauce was outstanding. The amount of tomato and onion was perfect. I will absolutely be back soon, their credit card machine will likely be up and running again. Only downside is trying to park in this area."

My husband were walking down Broadway looking for a place for dinner after having just moved to the area.  Gyros in an uncrowded casual place sounded good, and so glad we stopped in.

The food is well above average compared to other Greek restaurants, in my opinion.  My Greek salad was fresh and tasty, with delicious seasoned chicken, but the best part was the dressing.  I usually skip salad dressing b/c I prefer without and most dressing has funky added ingredients, or a lot of fat and sugar.  The proprietress encouraged me that this was not typical Greek dressing from a bottle and to try it.  Sooo glad I did.  Amazing olive oil, with a bit of vinegar, oregano, salt, pepper and nothing else.  Sounds simple, but I was almost licking the ramekin.  

The lamb in my husband&#39;s gyro was also amazing, and we left both very satisfied with the meal.  The proprietress (waitress, chef, and I&#39;m assuming owner) was also very friendly, and encouraged us to come back after telling her we were new in the area.  Don&#39;t have to ask us twice!"

We went on a Friday night at six and the place was totally empty except for us. No one came in while we were there.The owner said the night before was standing room only. Really?
I thought the pita  was good but the hummus was really mediocre. The falafal was good and the french fries weren&#39;t really cooked. Our sodas were in bottles served with cups of ice. Just overall my experience was slightly disappointing. I wouldn&#39;t return."

We went there during dinner time on a weekend and the place was empty. The gyros were good but the portions are a bit small. When the food came out, I felt like I could have gotten it from a fast food restaurant so it was below my expectations. The owner was nice and offered us a traditional greek dessert for us at the end of our meal. Unfortunately she cut us such a small portion and charged us $5 for it. To be honest, I felt a bit cheated because of that. Not a way to earn loyal customers..."

My boyfriend and I ordered the gyro special, which included a gyro, soda and fries. I was a little disappointed that it was a canned soda rather than a bottle but nonetheless the meal was excellent. One of the best gyros I&#39;ve had. We also ordered the hummus and pita plate as an appetizer, which was also very tasty. I noticed that they also serve alcohol, greek beer and ouzo as well!

This neighborhood can easily support this restaurant if everyone experienced the delicious high-quality food, affordable price, the comforting, unpretentious atmosphere, and authentic culture and family vibe of the place. I hope that our neighborhood can get behind it!!! The food is good, the owners are committed, and the place is down to earth. Our neighborhood is built for places like this!!! Let&#39;s support them ASAP!

Broadway&#39;s restaurant scene is good but polarized. We either have trendy/moderately high end options, or good budget options. There is not much in between, unless you count some just-ok spots like Hornet and Punch Bowl, but let&#39;s be honest, the food there is not great. Gozo, Lena, Beatrice and Woodsley have interesting cuisine, while Thai Monkey Club and Illegal Pete&#39;s let us enjoy ourselves in the cheap seats. This place adds a fantastic option for affordable and delicious cuisine we can&#39;t get elsewhere. 

I have been wanting to try this place as I live down the street. I will admit, because of the quiet opening and lack of hype, I instead tried &#34;Cho 77&#34; (little sister of Cholon) before trying this. I feel guilty that that hype an marketing got to me as this little Greek place is far superior than Cho&#39;s disappointing and overpriced experience. 

I don&#39;t exacltly know what this restaurant is supposed to be called. On the outside, it just say&#39;s &#34;Greek Restaurant.&#34; This is an accurate title. Inside, it feels like an established east coast Greek restaurant complete with a welcoming greek matriarch, and straightforward menu items.

GO HERE! TRY IT! You will not be disappointed."

My husband had the gyro sandwich and he thought it was tasty. Being meat-free for nearly 20 years, I went with a vegetarian option: the falafel sandwich. Upon telling the owner how much I enjoyed the texture of the falafel, the moistness complemented the slightly crunchy pita well, she explained that the falafel patties are made in house using fresh ingredients (never from a box). This goes for the rest of the menu, as well. We will definitely be back!"

And as old friends also grow and change we miss the past yet the evolution is also very good. From a gyro sandwich Moussaka  to the occasional roast leg of lamb the food is excellently prepared, and seasoned.   Home style Greek cooking with Greek beer or ouzo, Ismini has continued to provide excellent service and food. Smiling as I think of the pleasure of dining here.

Not masses of food but plenty for a lunch meal and very reasonably priced at $7.

I&#39;d been hesitant to try this place since it opened because, let&#39;s face it, it looks kinda dumpy from the outside and hardly even has a name.

Let me tell you, that was a mistake. My wife and I went last night for the first time and it was *incredible*. We had Dolmathes for an app and they were soft, warm and delicious. The tzatziki that came with was also excellent. It&#39;s going to become a theme, but the Gyros sandwich was the best I&#39;d ever had - tender, perfect seasoning, and great lamb flavor. Falafel was also, by far, the best I&#39;ve ever had. It had a crunch on the outside, but was soft and incredibly delicious. We had Baklava for dessert and once again, it towered over any I&#39;ve ever had before. To start with, it was a huge piece fresh out of the oven, and it was also packed with nuts and spices and honey and was just great.

I highly recommend stopping by this place for a cheap, fantastic meal! I was very, very glad that I did!"

I saw that this place had good reviews and so I gave it a try. The outside isn&#39;t sexy, and there isn&#39;t anything &#34;hip&#34; or fancy about the place. This is your a-typical hole in the wall diner, but with excellent food. The owners ( I assume) acknowledged me right away when I walked in, which I feel is key to starting off on the right foot. I got the lunch special falafal in a pita with french fries. I did have to wait a little bit which is never a problem with me. I would rather wait an extra 5 minutes to have something fresh from the kitchen than feel rushed and have cold sub-par food. The falafal was amazing! Hot and extremely tasty with the fresh tomatoes and onions. I had to order an extra side of tazitki, as it was extremely flavorful and thick. Not mayonnaise thick but it stuck on my pita wrap . Awesome! This has got to be one of the best greek places around . I totally recommend this place, and yes I will be back!"

While the food was fairly good, the price was too high for what is offered and this ;leaves it in a no-mans land between diner-cheap and destination worthy. 

I had a falafel sandwich, upgraded to sweet potato fries and added a side of tzaziki. With tip, my bill was just under $15.00.  In my opinion, that is too much for the &#34;neighborhood diner&#34; category I think they are going for. The portion is certainly not big enough for leftovers, which might have softened the price tag. 

The food itself was tasty. The falafel patty was moist, rich, flavorful and complemented by the tomato, red onion, and tzaziki sauce included.  Serving it in a little sleeve is a nice way to keep it together. 

The fries were standard, though again I&#39;m not sure the portion justified the 1.50 up-charge from potato fries. Same with the sauce. The tzaziki sauce worked fine in the sandwich, but as a side (1.80 or so up-charge! For 1 oz of yogurt!) it was way overpriced and much too salty. 

To become my neighborhood favorite, a place has to either bring on an amazing experience worth the sticker shock, or it need only be simple and keep it to less than $10 a meal. Isminis misses either mark, but it has promise if only the owner restructures the price model to keep it in competition with the many sub $10 options in the neighborhood, and there are many!"

We wandered up B&#39;way and came across a home-constructed sandwich board in front of the old Swift&#39;s (now the Ismini&#39;s-  same owner, new branding) promising falafels.

YUM.  ismini makes the falafel from scratch, flies in pita from Chicago, uses lovely greens...  AND there&#39;s a full bar.

Ismini, impressed with Eryc&#39;s ability to pronounce &#34;souvlaki&#34; and &#34;tzatziki,&#34; sat to chat with us for awhile about Crete, Greek food and restaurant operations.  We deemed her adorable.

It&#39;s not fancy, but it&#39;s an awesome, healthier alternative to Famous Pizza when you&#39;re crawling So B&#39;way."

My waffle came cold. The unassembled &#34;waffle sandwich&#34; was the worst, though. The cheese grits (that you pay an additional $1.25 for) had a square of fake Kraft-like American cheese plastered to the top and inside of the container. Looked very microwaved, lol.

Their fried chicken sandwich and Mac n cheese are honestly all I&#39;ve ever had there - BUT THEY ARE GREAT. If you can get down on some Mac this is the place to do it. 

As for atmosphere, Sam&#39;s feels a lot like your local Chilis. This is a casual dining place that is typically pretty busy, I would say &#34;ok&#34; for large groups in that they can accommodate you, but there will probably be a wait. The staff is always super friendly and it&#39;s clear they have a low retention rate since I&#39;ve only been a handful of times over two YEARS and they&#39;re all the same!

I normally eat at the downtown location since my hotel is close by. I always meet a good friend of mine before she goes to work, so we get there quite early and usually we have to eat fast and can&#39;t order a adult beverage.

Well this trip - I switched things up. I stayed the weekend and we were able to get brunch at the Sam&#39;s in Glendale.

No brunch is truly a brunch without a mimosas. Did you know Sam&#39;s has an entire mimosa menu?!?!?! Nope, I didn&#39;t either (see my picture). And these aren&#39;t just any mimosas for $10... they are ginormous!!! Absolutely I am convinced that you are drinking two &#39;normal&#39; sized. I ordered the Colorado Mango Mimosa. The mango puree really added something. The entire glass was gone pretty quick, and I had a nice buzz before 11a.m.

Food - I ordered the &#39;high-maintenance gluten free skillet&#39;. Yep, that&#39;s the actual name. Basically it&#39;s a veggie skillet with two corn tortillas with green chili on the side. The chili is by far the best part. Still hungry after eating my entire entree, I was offered and accepted the gift of leftover french toast from my friend. It was pretty good. Nothing fancy, but still yummy all the same.

Something I always forget about Sam&#39;s... you pay at the counter. It took me a while to notice our server wasn&#39;t coming back for my check and card. Must start to remember this!

We got there early, around 9:30am. By 11am there was a wait to be seated. If you can&#39;t be seated right away, the Glendale location has a full-service bar that you might snag a seat at."

For 11.00 it was a LOT of food to eat and I of course took what I couldn&#39;t eat home to share with my grandma who in turn now wants to go to Sams.

That being said, they don&#39;t seem to do any of it particularly well. My burger was dry and the fries were not cold, but room temperature- obviously they sit in the hot window and aren&#39;t made to order. Hubs got the fish and chips, it was 2 pieces of gorton&#39;s. They charge $13 for this! He sent it back and got a gyro. It was pretty average. The service was really good, but I wouldn&#39;t come here again unless I had a bunch of indecisive people.

My only suggestion would be to turn the music down for breakfast and up for dinner...the music was nonexistent when we went for dinner one night, but we could hardly hear each other during breakfast because the music (which was terrible) was TOO loud.

The food is hit and miss.  I come here a lot, and typically, it&#39;s pretty good.  Obviously good enough to keep me coming back.  I can&#39;t say it&#39;ll blow your mind, although some of their burritos the portions will - they&#39;re insanely huge.  Their green chile is nice, and makes a nice companion to a lot of the breakfasts.  Don&#39;t order a waffle though - it looks like an eggo waffle - thin, flimsy, not worth it.  Also, don&#39;t order bacon.  It&#39;s really fatty, not meaty.  Ask for suggestions if you&#39;ve never been.  Burritos, pancakes, mexican breakfasts - all good.

Opened in 2013, the new restaurant lives up to the Sam standard. Hearty portions. Great service. Wide selection. The Sam standard. Can&#39;t beat it. Can&#39;t rival it. It&#39;s hefty goodly fare.

Be it Curtis Street downtown, or the Aurora location, all Sam&#39;s are so wonderful. The service is always top notch at any location and the old photographs on the walls add to the rich Sam standard  history. This new location is no different. The iced tea is great. The International Sausage and eggs are meaty. The biscuits and gravy are so-so. Add a mimosa if you&#39;d like. You can.

We showed up today for Saturday morning breakfast. Luckily seating is open around the bar area. We put our name down on the waiting list, and also watched for two seats to open up, which they did, so we grabbed them.

Service at any of the Sam&#39;s No.3 is excellent, fast, and just plain good. Your coffee cup or glass of pepsi, etc, is always filled, without you really noticing. Your used/opened sugar packets and creamer containers are whisked away as well.

I am actually amazed the Sam&#39;s in Cherry Creek is even remotely affiliated with the one in denver.  

Waitress...horrible.  I have high standards I guess like don&#39;t tell me I didn&#39;t ask for sour cream when I did or how about not slamming my plate on the table.  I know that&#39;s asking for a lot but that&#39;s why I&#39;m never coming here again.

I normally go for breakfast/brunch as most of their entrees are very large portions.

My favorite dish is the veggie skillet. I sub green chile for the veggie version and then have tater tots (always crispy and delish) and flour tortillas. The skillet comes with two eggs any way you want them, a whole lots of veggies, a boat load of tots and covered with green chile. They bring it with two large flour tortillas and I always have leftovers.

You know it is worth going back to as the parking lot is normally packed. Since it is a horseshoe around the actual building it&#39;s not too hard to find a space."

Traversing my way through back lot neighborhoods to find a place to have a breakfast that doesn&#39;t taste of hotel squalor is tough in this town...but I managed to venture out, and found Sam&#39;s No. 3. 

I&#39;m a hard sell when it comes to service, in this new day and age...it&#39;s a lost art. As I walked in the busy facade, I found it interesting. And Jared (J-Bread) made the experience over the top. I wasn&#39;t expecting much from the tatted up server, but I was pleasantly inspired to rethink how these great diners are supposed to be. When I read on the menu the history, it was clear that this place is one of those neighborhood staples. 

For that I thank the bar tender at my hotel for the recommendation. If I find myself back in Denver, you&#39;ll find me in the corner booth, in J-Bread&#39;s section, looking forward to some great tasting steak and eggs with a side of pumpkin pancakes.

I&#39;ve tried a few of the other area restaurants for breakfast.  Some of them have been pretty good, but it&#39;s hard to beat Sam&#39;s.

Full (&amp; extensive) menu available all day, so I was able to order a blue cheese bacon burger for breakfast with no problem.  Staff is always friendly and efficient. No matter which side of the menu that you order from, the food is always top notch.

Our order was a bit slower coming out of the kitchen today than usual.  With the volume that they do on Sunday mornings, I guess that is to be expected occasionally.

They practice great customer service, and they get your food out in a flash.  Cocktails available for those needing their drink.

This location is nice, the interior is fairly new and looks clean.  The restaurant is big, with a lot of eating area options.  This location has a big bar with TVs positioned to watch sports.  There are also a couple of partitioned dining areas.

I was quite impressed at how quiet the place actually was considering how many people were in the place and the time of day that I went.  I had no trouble hearing the person sitting across from me despite the business of the restaurant.

They let you stay at the table as long as you like, we were there for over a couple of hours, including spending time just sitting and chatting.  The staff was nice, left us alone, and did not poke or prod, or annoy us with subtle reminders that we needed to be moving upon finishing our meal.  I noticed this was the case with several parties near  us.  Thanks!

What I also like about this Sam&#39;s is how it draws a good, mixed crowd of patrons.  Families, seniors, couples on a date, friends catching up over a beverage.  

Other reviews say that there is a wait?  Perhaps, but I&#39;ve never waited longer than 10 minutes.

The waiters and waitresses are the only reason why this place doesn&#39;t get a one star. The food is greasy and bland. The portions are simply too big even for even the hungriest of appetites. 

I get that it was on the food network for its &#34;Kitchen Sink&#34; burrito, but really, who cares at this point? Just because it was on tv, doesn&#39;t make it worth eating. 

There are so many other places around this area that blows the roof off of this place.

Not good or great, but OK.  They have a fun menu, but the execution of some things needs work.  For example, one day I ordered the Chile Rellenos and Eggs that&#39;s covered in their green chili.  In theory, this could have worked, but the chile rellenos were covered in a batter that was way too thick.  Once fried and then covered with chili, it was a real mess.  I pulled off most of the batter, but in the process lost all the chili.  What I was left with were a couple of nice poblano chiles with way too much cheese inside, eggs, and potatoes and a huge pile of breading and chili.  Yuck!

I&#39;ve had better luck with omelets.  The Denver omelet is good, as well as the Western omelet (Denver plus tomato), but I&#39;m not sure the Western omelet is worth the extra buck for the piddley amount of tomato they added (I actually had to look for it).

The servers are friendly.  The food comes out fast.  The restaurant is cute and big enough that the tables turn fast so you don&#39;t have to wait hours for breakfast.  Overall, it&#39;s an OK place to grab breakfast, but I think I&#39;ll stick to the less adventurous items on the menu."

The Buffalo burger comes one step below a burned hockey puck, despite having ordered it medium. The buns on all burgers were so toasted they crumbled at the first bite sending a sandstorm of crumbs this way and that! 

Good if you&#39;re desperate, or perhaps wanting eggs. There are several pages worth of eggs on the recipes. I haven&#39;t been here for breakfast so I can&#39;t comment on that.

Yeah, that was kind of how I felt after ordering the Kitchen Sink Skillet, upon the recommendation of Vicki P.&#39;s husband.  This massive mound of food contained onions, bell peppers, tomato, mushroom, ham, bacon,  sausage &amp; gyro meat.  It was topped with melted cheddar (Oh, yeah!).  And it was smothered with Kickin&#39; Pork Green Chili.   It really was a bit of a greasy, messy, gut bomb.  I think because I asked for my taters well done, I received an extra ladle of cooking oil to get them scorching hot.  This grease did pool a bit on my plate, but man this was a tasty heap of fried delights with eggs on top.  My marbled rye toast on the side was nicely done as well.  My iced latte (still just a bit warm out for me to switch to hot coffee) was not too shabby.  All in all, I am glad that Sam&#39;s #3 took over the old Sam Taylor&#39;s BBQ space."

I would otherwise be giving Sam&#39;s a 4 or 5, they&#39;re great for breakfast in general, and have delicious pancakes. But the other day my God mother and I met for breakfast and I sadly ordered the above. 

Sadly, because it wasn&#39;t steak, it was Fake and Eggs, and was so terrible that I absolutely had to doctor it up with A1...a good steak needs only salt and pepper. 

This was the kind of road kill fake steak that has been compressed into a brick of meat and dyed and called steak...given the quality and reputation of Sam&#39;s, not to mention the 7.99 price, I never would have thought I&#39;d be getting a (st)fake like it was. I remember looking at the grill lines, and then the indentations left by the compression machine, and thinking I may have gotten a fatter better smelling McRib meat slab...

I usually stick with breakfast no matter what time of day that I go there. The chile rellenos and eggs are my favorite or the hard hat. I usually order the green chili on the side that way my rellenos don&#39;t get too soggy. The hard hat includes 2 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon or sausage (I usually get two of each or upgrade to turkey sausage) and it comes with two sides. I like to split the chile rellenos and the hard hat with my mom or husband when I go. That way I get some meat and one relleno (which is plenty). 

Today, I tried a hamburger wrapped in lettuce with a side greek salad. It was very yummy but I think I would rather have breakfast when I am there.

When you go in, there&#39;s a counter where you can put your name in and pay. If you eat to the left of the counter near the bar it will be much quieter. If you eat to the right of the counter it&#39;s a little nosier. I am not sure why that is but it can get loud.

I lightly twisted my cousin&#39;s arm into coming here; we were gonna have brunch at the Egg and I but I&#39;ve been there pretty often and wanted to try something new.

This location was crazy busy on a Saturday morning.  We were seated very quickly and the waitress was as patient and kindly as a human could be while I perused the choices on the menu.  My cousin and I hadn&#39;t seen or really talked to each other in 3 months so it was hard juggling things while he was asking me questions about my life goings-on.  I think my cousin ordered the Mr. Sam&#39;s Big Breakfast, and I finally settled on the Kitchen Sink Skillet -- it looked awesome, and I&#39;m happy to say it tasted that way as well.

I was on about day 5 of a bad summer cold then, and my throat felt like raw hamburger -- I was wondering what to drink when my eyes fixed on the Bloody Mary option.  I asked the waitress if they were fairly strong and spicy; she told me I&#39;d have to be the judge on whether they were strong or not, but that they were spicy.  It was bliss drinking that stuff down a sore throat; it actually helped me to be able to speak much better.  Cheers for spicy boozy drinks.

Great diner feel with a boatload of options; very happy with my experience and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back at some point."

I work close to Sam&#39;s so I come here often. The menu is huge so it&#39;s a perfect place to come if your group has diverse food preferences. I like the breakfasts, american food, greek food, burritos, and Green Chili. I&#39;m not as much of a fan of the other Mexican and south of the border options. Friendly and fast service.

The atmosphere and decor was pretty friendly and they had a wide variety in their menu.  I&#39;m a skillet kind of guy so I ordered one of their many skillets, this skillet had a little of everything which sounded uh-mazing plus it was smothered in green-chili yum! Sad to say the skillet was just alright, the food didn&#39;t come out hot and the mix of flavors was that I thought would be flavorful just didn&#39;t live up to the expectations I had.  Overall the environment was nice but the food was okay.  Wouldn&#39;t mind trying again but not dying to go again with all that being said I give it a solid 3/5."

Keep making the mistake of giving this restaurant my money. Every time we go there or get delivery from there, the food is always wrong, and the staff at the restaurant is always rude and never takes ownership for the mistakes they make with the orders. Sad excuse for a food establishment."

I&#39;ve only been to this Glendale location but I go at least once a month and it never disappoints. The menu is so large - and being from the Midwest it&#39;s nice to have a place with (really good) cheese curds. My personal favorite to get though is the 3 cheese omelet with the French Toast - I got that on Black Friday morning and it was the best its ever tasted in all the times I&#39;ve been coming here. The atmosphere here is also my favorite - I love how modern it is. Staff is always beyond friendly and very helpful. I take anyone from out of town to this place. Best spot in town for breakfast especially, and I love that it&#39;s served all day. Highly recommend stopping by if you&#39;re in the area."

The staff here is always busy talking to each other and sometimes it feels like they aren&#39;t paying attention. 
Breakfast here is good - pancakes, cinnamon roll, french toast, muffin top - All wonderful. The 3 pound burrito is really good and not over stuffed with any one thing which is good because who wants to eat all potatoes? 
Lunch/Dinner items - EH. My Gyro wasn&#39;t great the fries were bland and limp and one of them when I took a bite was still raw - gross. My friend got a french dip which looked good but he said didn&#39;t have much flavor. My daughter got chicken strips which normally she loves and even at 1 she threw them on the floor. After tasting it I know why. It was flavorless and tasted like they were frozen ones I could buy at the store. I was pretty disappointed."

What happened to number one and two?!?  All kidding aside, I wish we had more diners like this in LA.  

Sam&#39;s No. 3 has an extensive menu, which makes it hard to decide on what to order.  Once I settled on something, I made the mistake of flipping through the rest of the menu and probably changed my mind five times!

I finally settled on the Naked French Canadian Swiss Melt (two scrambled eggs with Swiss cheese and Canadian bacon inside two pieces of French toast).  It was pretty heavy on the grease, which is to be expected at a diner.  The corned beef burrito is filled with canned corned beef and home-style potatoes.  It was good, but nothing special.  

Our waitress was pleasant and friendly, but it took her a little while to take our order because this place was packed with hungry patrons.  She was very diligent in making sure my coffee was always filled and came to check on us often."

This location is now my favorite, while busy it is not crazy packed and did not resemble the circus seen outside the downtown location during brunch time.  I was able to easily get a spot at the bar and I did not have people in big groups giving me dirty looks because I got a seat before them.  The food is just as good as the downtown location.  I had an omelet and french toast and it could have fed two people.  Considering the french toast was included with my order I definitely got my money&#39;s worth.  Service was friendly and fast.

Salads are good.  My biggest issue has been the slow service I have experienced - several times with my family at a booth, but also alone at the bar.  I swear I have sat at the bar 3-4 times with both bar tenders (the cave man guy and the brunette) both moving back and forth in front of me, serving everyone but me. I felt like the invisible man, it was amazing.

I will probably come back out of convenience, but knowing I will likely get slow service."

I&#39;ve been to the one downtown a number of times and I&#39;ve always really enjoyed it there, once I finally made it through the line of people.

If you&#39;re expecting the same feel as the two other smaller Sam&#39;s No 3&#39;s, you won&#39;t find it here. It&#39;s a large one, which has some beauty in itself (remember those lines of people I talked about?). However, in my opinion, Sam&#39;s No 3 got famous for its small restaurant feel and its delicious breakfast creations. So if you&#39;re trying this place for your first Sam&#39;s experience I would strongly recommend taking your business to the downtown location first. You&#39;ll wait a bit longer but you&#39;ll get a good feel for the hustle and bustle that is Sam&#39;s No 3.

I was approached by Amanda (bartender) and asked, &#34;Do you want anything to drink?&#34;  I affirmed, &#34;Yes, water&#34;.  About 20 minutes later, Amanda was present in my section of the bar again.  I said, &#34;Excuse me.&#34; Amanda responded snarky, &#34;Can you give me one sec?&#34;  Everyone present in my group gasped at her tone of voice.  I did not immediately respond, given my shock.  I said, &#34;Okay&#34; to her eventually.  Amanda did not return to service my request within the next hour or so and I was greeted by a new male bartender.

At Approximately, 1 pm I was asked by Amanda did I want anything to drink and I said, &#34;no&#34;.  A few minutes later, I struck up a conversation with another patron regarding the meal he was having and if he enjoyed it.  He stated, &#34;I did.. but the service here sucks.  He went on to talk about his experience in customer service and his girlfriend was former manager at Toby Keith restaurant.  She was appalled at the service here.&#34;  I began to tell him my earlier experience with the snarkyness from Amanda and how I was planning to email corporate and write a Yelp review.  At this time, Amanda had walked over to your corner of the bar and while wiping counters near me, she stated &#34;You don&#39;t think I can here you.&#34;  I responded, &#34;What?&#34;  She said, &#34;You don&#39;t think I can hear you talking about your Yelp review and the service.&#34;  At this time, a friend of mine interjected to alleviate the situation.  I was not pleased that a bartender would confront a customer for discussing the horrible experience/service received.  Amanda returned to the opposite corner of the bar and spoke with the male bartender.  The patron who I had been conversing with received a reduction in their meal/drink for the poor service, according to the male bartender.  I assume this at the request of Amanda given the discussion held prior to his explanation.

Moments later, my friend apologized to Amanda for possibly sounding rude when explaining customer service.  Amanda responded, &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t... He (referring to me) was just over here talking about his Yelp review and thought I didn&#39;t hear him.&#34;   I took this as another snarky indignation against me and I was beyond pissed with this woman.  I didn&#39;t say a work to Amanda after this comment.  

Soon after, I asked for my check from the male bartender and left.  I did not receive a discount, apology, etc. from anyone at the business.  I think Amanda is extremely unprofessional and should not be working in customer service.  She obviously has a bit of a chip on her shoulder and is confrontational, which does nothing but elevate the situation.  I was shocked and surprised by her actions this afternoon and I have never experienced this from staff at Sam&#39;s No. 3.  Needless to say, I have no desire to continue spending money at this place of business and will seek refuge elsewhere.  If I had been snarky, disrespectful and confrontational with a bartender.. I&#39;m sure I would no longer be welcomed and I feel the same in return."

It&#39;s diner fare, so don&#39;t be expecting some kind of haute cuisine.  I enjoy a variety of things here but tend to lean on the Mazatlán Omelet paired with a fruit parfait as a side (a substitution upgrade), scratch corned beef and hash with the fruit parfait, the chili dogs, or even the French dip."

I can tell when a Vietnamese is authentic when its full of Vietnamese eating there.   i started with spring rolls and some jazmine tea. The service is good and the server does appreciate you as a customer. Every time I go here they do have good service a majority of the time. 

I ordered the number nine and instead of waiting like a hostage to be released the order was filled quickly. 

The broth is authentic and they supply a generous amount of vegetables to go along with it. Simply put, well prepared. 

I felt like getting a treat afterwards so I ordered the Mango boba drink. I know its made with powder, but it&#39;s still good. 

The restaurant itself is not fine dining but its the food and good service that  keeps me coming back. There are some bad pho places in Denver, one of them located on 6th avenue, but it&#39;s places like this that give the patron an authentic experience of eating authentic food."

Walked into the building and was impressed by the interior: black granite and a big mirror along one wall. Cheesy Vietnamese music playing overhead...Vietnamese music is hilarious but adds to the ambiance of eating this delicious food.

I don&#39;t know why but at many Vietnamese restaurants they have no idea what I&#39;m talking about when I order veggies to add to my rare steak and brisket pho. To me this seems like a no brainer. Soup. Add vegetables. Feel me? Soup should have vegetables in it and it makes pho 10x better. I asked for &#34;carrots and snow peas on the side&#34;. His response, and I quote, was &#34;what  that look like, a salad?&#34; This is despite the kitchen having said vegetables, in broth, ready to be served. I dunno. He brought me a side bowl with ONE (1) carrot slice, some green beans, squash, and broccoli. Not even close to what I asked but, it&#39;ll work I guess.

The pho was A1. Hot broth teeming with noodles and meat. The broth was a little on the fatty side but still slurpingly delicious! Prices were within pennies of 98% of the pho joints in Denver, which is about $10.75 for a medium plus my so hard to understand extra veggies."

This restaurant is very similar in layout as all the other pho restaurants, such as having freedom in choosing your table, as well as the condiments on the table (siracha, hoisin sauce, salt/pepper and chili paste).

Upon entering, one of the waiters yelled across the restaurant saying to pick any seat, very informal, but expected, and not bothering. The staff was very friendly and the food came out super fast. I ordered the small pho with beef and tendon and a spring roll appetizer. 

Here are the reasons why this place only got 3 stars: the tendon had a very unusual taste. I&#39;ve been to plenty of pho restaurants and tendon has never tasted like that. It was an unpleasant, unusual taste. The broth was wholesome and savory but was a little colder than normal. I can tell it was cold because my steak was still pink and stayed pink in the center. The spring roll was mostly chopped iceberg lettuce, and for $5 it&#39;s not even worth it. This restaurant is mediocre compared to other places I have been to in Denver. 

Pros: friendly staff, open environment, fast service"

1. Broth - First sip very good.  A little salty but still good broth. Add stuff.  And get down. 

2. Cleanliness - clean.  Open.  Maintained.  Some one cares. 

3. Ingredients - really fresh.  Generous. 

4. Staff - these guys were young and helpful.  New a bunch of regs so that was good hearing them interact.  I was there at 2:00 and people we still coming in every couples minutes.  So obviously established.

Service was quick. Food was served promptly. They do have paper napkins, but not disposable chop stick. Restaurant was clean and food was at a good price.

Pho broth was tasty and the vegetable mix was nice, but it only came with a couple pieces of tofu.

It wasn&#39;t bad either by any means, but there just wasn&#39;t anything to rave about after dinner. Their service wasn&#39;t all too impressive either, which is probably why I don&#39;t plan to go back except to maybe give their food one more try and I guess see if their service improves.

We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer with pork and shrimp, these were great!! A little on the smaller side but I can see why they were less than $5. I had the medium pho with meat balls and rare steak - some positives were that it was huge and they give lots of meat, the broth was good, it came out nice and hot, and good tasting meatballs. My bf had the sesame chicken - we had better before, but it wasn&#39;t bad (like I said, it was &#34;okay&#34;). I&#39;d go back for the nice portioned pho.

The service. The servers were not very friendly - actually one particular server that took our order was not friendly, the rest that occasionally (very rarely) checked on us were at least pleasant. There was a football game on tv which was far more interesting than doing their job. They only refilled our water once without needing to ask for it, even though we had been without water a couple times and needed to flag someone down. All three of the guys working just sat together and watched the football game.

Having been to many noodle houses (saimin and pho), the service is usually where they are really exceptional because in Asian culture (I am Japanese), serving your guests is very important. I&#39;d say overall, their food was average and their service was below average. Had they provided better service I would have given them 4 stars. I suppose I&#39;ll give them another try and rate them again in the near future to report if there&#39;s improvement."

I legitimately have never had more delicious crab cheese wontons in my life, you really just have to try it to believe it.

The &#34;famous four&#34; (Tu quy) at $29.95 is a large family style dish that contains grilled pork, grilled shrimp, deep fried shrimp paste, soft shell crab with assorted vegetables and lettuce.   I recommend inviting 2 to 3 other friends to dig into this dish as you wrap up meats and veggies with rice paper and dipping it into the fish sauce.  The meats are flavorful and the variety from this foursome keeps the taste buds from becoming bored.  Hard to go wrong with that.

Im pretty disappointed that the price went up though when i came in today. The price of a small pho is 7.25 now. Im pretty sure it used to be less. I actually just went to another pho 3 days ago and there small is 5.75. The taste is the same and so is the portion so I would prefer to go to one thats lower in price.

And then he told me to wait, because he said he&#39;s going to ask the owner. 15 minutes later, one if the waitress came over to my table and said with an upset tone, he said no we can&#39;t change the channel because there are a lot of people watching the channel right now (while pointing at the other customers.) Then i said, well if you can&#39;t change it for me, then just said so without looking so upset in front of me my family.

Okay I&#39;ll admit it, so I walked into Pho 75 thinking it was Pho 95, which had raving reviews and I just had to try it out while I was in CO Springs. But to my own disappointment I got the numbers confused and I walked into Pho 75 instead. I knew the front of the restaurant didn&#39;t match the picture in my head! But oh well, we were there so we tried. it.

They seated us quick, and the service was good considering it was pretty packed the night we went. The waiter took our order as soon as we sat down. The prices were decent, but the portions were pretty big. In my party we had both the smallest and the biggest size and fullness wise both people went home stuffed.

From my experience with Vietnamese food (and correct me if I&#39;m wrong), most pho places I&#39;ve tried call the crispy, small, egg rolls &#34;spring rolls,&#34; and the wrap with lettuce and shrimp &#34;summer rolls.&#34; Here, the egg rolls are called egg rolls, and the other wrap thing is a spring roll so when I refer to it don&#39;t get confused because I did at the restaurant.

Either way, we ordered both, and the &#34;spring roll,&#34; was a bit spicy because they stuff the center of it with cilantro and some other types of leaves. I couldn&#39;t quite figure out what it was. Added a slight bitter taste to it, and there wasn&#39;t enough shrimp in it so it was just like biting into a lettuce wrap. The &#34;egg roll,&#34; was really good and crispy overall.

The broth in the pho was satisfying because it wasn&#39;t too salty nor oily like some of the bad I&#39;ve had in the past. The quality of the meat wasn&#39;t too bad, and the server was good on accommodating what everyone needed for their soup ingredients.

The lasting impression? &#34;Overall, good broth but not impressive. Someone tell me what the numbers mean! Or do they mean nothing?!&#34;

Thanks Thomas S! :

Hi Julie, 

The Pho # is usually a number significant to the owner, most commonly the year they arrived in the U.S., which is why you see a lot of Pho 75, 77, 79, and other numbers greater than 75.  Sometimes, it is just a lucky number like Pho 555."

The prices are very reasonable. If you aren&#39;t in the mood for hot soup, order #16 - you won&#39;t be sorry! The rare beef pho (#2) is phenomenal. The only thing that might improve the experience is a liquor license. A beer or rice wine would be a nice competent to the meal. The spring rolls are delicious and the dipping sauce is tasty with a nice amount of zing."

The bun bo hue on the other hand is really really really ridiculously good! If I had to compare it to my mom&#39;s, I&#39;d give my mom the slight edge just by default lol. The bun bo hue is so flavorful and fragrant. Pipping hot steamy spicy red hot broth of deliciousness. Pigs feet, beef, blood pudding, what more could you ask for? It&#39;s not as popular and ubiquitous as pho, but it&#39;s just as damn good if not better than it in my opinion! You don&#39;t need hoisin sauce to add or enhance the flavor.

Apparently a friend of his experienced the horror everyone thinks about but either disregards it or ignores it.  This is how the story goes:  his friend ordered and complained about his good.

My vege pho came packed with veges including bok choy and I love bok choy. They will ask on their own what broth you want and that is a plus imo considering some places will just give you beef broth if you dont say anything.

The restaurant is pretty large in size, especially for a Pho restaurant. The weekends and evenings are usually pretty busy, just not jam packed. The waiters are always very nice and quick at taking orders and having water out.

I love the Pho as it always arrives hot and there&#39;s enough noodles in meat to fill my hunger and satisfy my Pho fix.

Something else I LOVE from here is the Bun Rieu! A huge bowl for an affordable price, very authentic flavor as well. I would advise not to buy it when the place is about to close because it gets a bit salty. 

I also usually order the egg roll appetizer; their egg rolls are delicious (my favorite, actually)! It comes with four egg rolls, lettuce, fish sauce, and various vegetables.

They have have bun rieu on the special&#39;s menu that is a must try, definitely worth it... better than the pho.

Definitely very annoying, but I&#39;m hoping they get their act together soon."

Their Sinh To (fruit smoothies) are the best. I especially recommend the juicy Mit (jackfruit), sugary Mang Cau (soursop) and, of course, the notorious Sau Rieng (durian). I am a huge durian fan and find myself often singing the praises of this admittedly noxious-smelling fruit. At times I have even been known to &#34;accidentally&#34; order the durian smoothie just to annoy my dining companions. But if anything will convert you to being a fan of this fruit, it&#39;s Pho 75&#39;s smoothie. 

Food you say? I was just getting to that thank you. I like the deeply spicy Bun Bo Hue (central Vietnamese beef, blood and offal noodle soup in a lemongrass broth served with shrimp/chili paste). This bold beefy broth is even better with the sawtooth herb, perilla and shredded banana blossom that come alongside. Their rice plates, like Com Suon Bi (with a moist pork chop and squishy shredded pork skin) and Com Ga Dai (bone-in free-range black chicken, or as the menu calls it, &#34;special chicken&#34;) are also winners. 

So what are you waiting for? Get down there and see for yourself."

Seeing as how it is crap-tasticly snowing and cold out today, I thought pho would be a wonderful choice for lunch.

I strolled in and got a to-go order, a #2 (steak pho) to be exact.  The man at the counter was kind of grouchy, but they were super busy so I let it slide.  Just about every table in the place was taken and the waiters where constantly in &amp; out of the kitchen with giant bowls of pho goodness!  It also smelled so very good in there!  I was getting hungrier by the minute while I waited!

My take out order didn&#39;t take too long.  Maybe about 5 minutes.  But it wasn&#39;t packed very well.  The bowl of broth crushed the container with the veggies, meat &amp; noodles in it and the broth kept falling over.  I just took the broth out when I got to my car and put it in my cup holder.

When I got back to my office and un-packed everything, as per usual, as with EVERY freakin&#39; pho place I get take out from, the bowl is so full of broth that there is no room to add anything!  Why can&#39;t these places put the same amount of broth in a larger bowl?!?!?  I&#39;m just sayin!!!  The chopsticks they gave me were also warped which made them very hard to eat with and the little plastic spoon was a joke.  I actually have sores on either side of my top lip from the somewhat sharp edge of the spoon rubbing on it.

Anyway, down to the food, which is the point of my ramblings here.  It was hands down, the best pho I&#39;ve had so far.  The broth was so flavorful and I was super impressed!  It just sucked having to suck down broth, add some ingredients, then suck down more broth, add more ingredients, and so on.

On a side note, they don&#39;t deliver.  I asked.  However, I will DEFINITELY be back again!  Maybe I just need a giant bowl, chopsticks and a big spoon to keep at my office?  Nice job, Pho 75!"

I&#39;ve been coming here for years. Even back before it was Pho 75. I didn&#39;t know what good Pho was until Pho 75 took over the location. The broth is the best with rich flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. Prices are cheap compared to some other places around. The servers are very nice and know my wife and I well. We go here at least once a week if we can help it. 

Highly recommend this place. The Pho, bun rieu, and bun bo hue are our favs. Actually everything I&#39;ve ever had was delicious. Try them out!

It&#39;s not bad or fabulous, but I feel like the flavor is kind of forgettable. I only really go here because I live right by this place. So it&#39;s convenient. I usually get the number 6 small. The meat is pretty good. The noodles aren&#39;t hard and they give a good amount which is nice. The onions are good, but one thing that makes this thing just okay, once again, its the broth!

When I lived in Aurora, I was a weekly regular.
It does have it&#39;s off days but usually it&#39;s consistent.
The key to a good pho place is their broth, and the broth here is usually very good (there have been times when it hasn&#39;t been but that&#39;s very rare). Once it&#39;s served, if you screw it up by what you add to it, that&#39;s your pho inexperience showing. Suggest slowly adding to it &amp; sampling until you get it the way you want.
It can get very busy during prime hours but since I usually don&#39;t go during prime hours I&#39;ve never had problem. 
I&#39;ve tried most of their menu and most of it has met with my satisfaction. 
If they have the fresh avocado boba (fresh is the key!), get it! It&#39;s delicious &amp; very refreshing on a hot summer day. Personally I usually order without the boba balls as I don&#39;t care to &#39;chew&#39; my drink.
Decor could use updating but that&#39;s pretty typical of most Vietnamese places around town. 
Most people would probably visit during lunch &amp; dinner but I&#39;ve been there right when they open too (comes from traveling throughout Asia where it&#39;s typical to have soup for breakfast). As far as I know they open earlier than any other pho place n Aurora and most of the Denver area (I think there&#39;s a place on Federal that opens half-hour earlier)."

Sister and I were debating on what to eat so we decided here. The broth was AMAZING! It has never tasted that good. So their broth isn&#39;t consistent which is a shame.

The menu isn&#39;t large but, they do have some non-pho and vegetarian selections. This is a good place for lunch. Service was ok and the coffee and tea selections(specifically the filtered espresso with condensed milk you get to pour yourself) were tasty.

We go here at least twice a week for our pho fix.  Consistently good pho and decent selection of rice dishes.  My favorite dish here would be the Bun Bo Hue or Hue style beef noodle soup.  This dish is spicy and aromatic, with a mix of beef, pork feet, and congeled pork&#39;s blood.  OK, sounds gross, but very yummy.

Another can&#39;t go wrong dish are the combination wraps - a mix of soft shell crab, lemon grass grilled beef and pork, as well as a fried shrimp and a fried shrimp paste.  This all comes with rice noodles, veggies and rice paper to make wraps with.  All of this for $24 or something like that, plus tip, around $30, but this can feed 5 people easily, possibly six.  We always have food to take home with only 4 people."

That being said I spent some time on the phone and with Yelp looking desperately for a pho place in A-town that served vegetarian pho.  Not in the &#34;oh we took the chicken out&#34; way but in the legit, veggie broth way.  After three calls I happened upon Pho 75.  After questioning them &#34;you have vegetable broth?&#34;  &#34;Yes.&#34;  &#34;Like made with vegetables and not chicken?&#34;  &#34;Yes&#34;  So off I went.  

It&#39;s in a strip mall (what isn&#39;t?) and the interior wastes no time with frills but looks are deceiving.  The choices for pho were plentiful and they offer pho in three sizes all for a reasonable price.  Foolishly I ordered the large to go. Jesus H.  I got the beast home and opened the bag to set things up.  One giant container of broth and a to-go plate STUFFED with noodles, veggies, and herbs.  Holy sh!t is the only way to properly sum up the reaction to this and I picked it all up for around $7.  Crazy.

The flavors are spot-on, subtle yet flavorful allowing the other bits to shine.  Veggies were plentiful and crisp even after transport.  Well played. I&#39;m really going to have to fight the urge to eat here for the rest of my trip.

Hooray for Pho 75!

Although nothing beats home made pho from a vietnamese family (which my friend Kimberly graciously introduced me to), Pho 75 is not too shabby at all. 

I thought the Pho was pretty good. I mean, I&#39;ve had better (cough cough Golden Deli), but it was actually authentic. I could tell they were a little understaffed when I went, which might explain why our bowls came a little later than we expected. If you are familiar with Pho restaurants, Pho is a relatively easy dish to assemble. It shouldn&#39;t take that long to bring us our order. That is the first thing I look for in a Pho restaurant. 

The Second is the quality of the broth. Quality pho has to be flavourful and refined enough to be clean (not greasy). The flavour at Pho 75 was just okay... nothing special. Actually I would say it was slightly watered down for my taste. BUT I didn&#39;t see a single drop of oil on my broth, which is great. 

The Third thing every authentic viet restaurant has to have is good noodles. Some pho places use noodles that are too thick. I&#39;ve seen restaurants (like the Rio Buffett at the Rio Casino in Las Vegas, which by the way serves Pho during lunch) serving pho in linguini-like noodles. Sacre bleu! Fortunately Pho 75 uses standard rice noodles. 

Although service is a bit slow, they are quite friendly (and they don&#39;t seem to rob you of a few cents). My only complaint is seeing the waiter&#39;s fingertips touching my soup as he served it to us (yuk). I guess I won&#39;t die from it, but... yuk. Try their coconut ice cream with deep friend banana rolls... it&#39;s very delish. 

In my eyes, this is a 4."

I&#39;m sorry; I can&#39;t get on board with the Pho movement. Being as this was my first experience, I can&#39;t say that I know what I am doing as far as this stuff is concerned. Alas, I offer a newbie perspective. The place was really busy when I went, so it must be popular. The service, for the amount of people in the restaurant was decent; these guys were running from table to table the whole time I was there. The place smelled funny and the bathrooms were a little grimy, which sort of made me worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen. The food tasted okay, from the looks of it this stuff is really what you make of it. If you add the wrong things to your bowl, you will likely be unhappy. The bowls are very large, and even with a small I was surprised by the size. Still, for the price... I just don&#39;t understand how some rice noodles, broth and a few pieces of meat are worth it; perhaps I&#39;m just clueless.
Why is everyone making a big deal out of this stuff? At this point I am kind of wishing I hadn&#39;t eaten it; not because it was bad but because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth smelling like Pho all day after the fact. Anyways, it was nice that they have other options on the menu here if you aren&#39;t in the mood for Pho. I certainly wouldn&#39;t recommend bring someone here who isn&#39;t adventurous when it comes to food, they will be very unhappy.

So now for the negative part of my review so food can take a place far but only as far as the customer service and attention to detail to the patrons order, right? Well I ordered a &#34;pho dac biet&#34; (combination) with my tai on the side with a bowl of onions and vinegar. Well I didn&#39;t get my tai on the side it was in there whoopie I&#39;ll let it go, but where was my onions and vinegar? So I asked again and got a small dish that had some vinegar spooned onto it I assume, so really I got onions that someone spilled vinegar on so on my order missed 2 for 2 for my very simple special orders, now my friend wanted one of the boba drinks but is not a fan of the actual boba so she said &#34;no boba please&#34; well like the plot of a nancy drew mystery, her drink mysteriously came with boba!!! So special request were all out the window!      But a bonus to this place is not only do thay have kiwi boba! There right next to a Pleasures, so after you get your pho on you can walk next door and get something to help you get your freak on! Nice!!!"

I will say they do have very fresh vegetables and good tofu. But If you are vegetarian, dive a little further until they improve the broth (it was mostly just water)."

It&#39;s pretty far from where i live, but this place is sooo good and cheap! I&#39;ve tried everything and its&#39; all delcious! 

Cabbage rolls are juicy and moist and tasty flavors.

Goulash is a nice hearty delicious flavorful stew

Hunters Stew- was really good and similar to goulash IMO.

Pierogis are the best I&#39;ve had so far and better than when I bought them at the polish store and even had them at Cracovia.  I love the options you can pick an the garlic parsley sauce is my favorit. I love the mushroom sauerkraut flavor because the pork was a bit mushy  and the only one I don&#39;t care for.

Keilbasa sandwich is soo good, my husband wished they offered a sausage plate though. The sausage is soo juicy and plump and the sauerkraut is deliciously sweet, but not too sweet and I&#39;m not a sweet person when it comes to my entrée&#39;s but rather more on the savory side. 

Their cinnamon crisps and desserts are delicious and I also get some when I go here.

Now on to my Favorite addiction! 

The Zapiekanka is a delicious half a sliced French bread with toppings of cole slaw, mushrooms, corn and what seems to be somewhat of a thousand island dressing flavor. It is Absolutely DELICIOUS!! Oh god, I&#39;m salivating just writing this and yesterday I got 2 of them, thinking it would keep my cravings at bay, but seems not.
They give you a stamp for each entrée you buy and I was able to get 10 stamps and cash in to get my 10 free pierogis too. I have just 2 more stamps till my next 10 free ones.  This place is Really delicious and worth the drive."

It was a very late lunch for Hubs.  From the simple Menu, they had Hubs ordered the Goulash and Pierogies that afternoon.  The first order was Beef Goulash with 6 pieces of Feta &amp; Spinach Pierogies ($7.99) and the second order was Beef Goulash with 6 pieces of Potato &amp; Cheese Pierogies ($7.99).  All the Main Entrees comes with Sauerkraut Salad. 

Since I already had a heavy Breakfast that day, I just opt for the Chocolate Croissant ($2.99).  The Main Entrees are relatively cheap on the books at least below $10.00 after tips and tax.  We so wish they could expand more in terms of Food offerings, for those who DO NOT EAT PORK.

Overall, Hubs liked his order for Lunch.  The dishes he had reminded him of his late Grandma cooking.  Hubs is happy that afternoon.  Personally for me, I prefer the Beef Goulash more than the Pierogies.  Maybe due to the fact that I don&#39;t grow up with Pierogies as compared to Hubs.

I also like my order of Chocolate Croissant.  Its slightly different from what I am used to.  Maybe because it has some Polish roots that I am unaware of.  All in all, it was a successful late Lunch event.  May return when needed and perhaps from there my review my differ.  3.5 stars!

I have never eaten authentic Pierogis or Polish food, so I can only give my overall impressions.  I ordered one of the more popular of options to get a benchmark of sorts, the Golabek-cabbage roll with sauteed potato and cheese Pierogis  topped with sour cream and onions.  Loved the cabbage roll!  They were delicious and the tomato sauce a perfect compliment.  I think my choice of filling may have influenced my impressions of the Pierogis.  Though the potato and onion and / or potato and cheese are &#34;traditional&#34;, they were not my favorite, and I knew that would be the case from the beginning.  I would like to try some of the other flavors, perhaps the meat or feta and spinach to get a better sense.  Pierogis were cooked with a nice crisp base from being sauteed, maybe a little more &#34;doughier&#34; than I expected but still very good.

My boys all took the high road and ordered Kielbasa Sandwiches.  They enjoyed the sandwich, but had no real comments, good or bad.  Overall friendly, quick service and solid quality of food.  The frozen pierogis looked like a great option to try."

With the perogies factory a mere 7 minutes from our house, we have just found our new local place. For starters the owner is unbelievably nice. We overheard him telling another customer that his grandma taught him how to cook. And boy was she a good teacher. 

For lunch I went with the golbaki, a cabbage roll filled with pork and spices topped with a sweet tomato sauce. It was a perfect marriage of sweet and savory. I went with the 4 pierogi option and got the sauerkraut and mushroom. They were sautéed and oh so good. The hubs got the pork pierogis topped with onions and sour cream. Another home run. 

We cannot wait to come back and explore more of the menu."

And with good reason!  This former taco shop has been cutely updated into a Hidden Gem for authentic Polish Pierogies on middle Wads.  Whodathunk?

It&#39;s counter service, and they&#39;re newish, and each order is made fresh, so they&#39;ve got some tweaking to do in the efficiency department.  If it&#39;s busy, expect to wait in line to order, and then to wait at the table for your food.  (For now.)  

But it&#39;s worth it. I promise. 

I&#39;ve sampled their (Hungarian-style) Goulash, served with their house-made Sauerkraut Salad.  That Sauerkraut blew me away. Not too tangy, but contrast enough to pair perfectly with the hearty (yet surprisingly not heavy!) Goulash.  This plate comes with either 4 or 6 of their trademark Pierogi, sautéed with onions.  I mean... Yeah!  

Hubs got 6 fried Pierogi, 3 Potato and Cheese and 3 meat (Pork.)  They were somehow not greasy, and he dunked them in tomato sauce for a great little hand-held snack.

Happy to see another local, ethnic, fledgling business sprout here in the area.

Added bonuses: they have vegan ice cream from sweet action! (along with other non-vegan options too), pellegrino fruit drinks and take-away frozen options.

Polish food is extremely underrepresented in Denver (and most cities), especially when compared to the ubiquitous Italian and Mexican food establishments around town. Well, there may not be many, but Pierogies Factory makes up for that with some great quality and exceptional value. 

For people who&#39;ve never had a pierogi, I&#39;d describe it as the Eastern European equivalent of the potsticker.  They&#39;re most commonly filled with cheese, potato and/or onion, however at Pierogies Factory, you can branch out to some fillings that are less traditional and more exciting.

I think pierogies are best when pan sauteed and topped with onions, but you can get them done a few different ways.

One thing not to miss is the sour kraut cabbage salad. I could eat that stuff by the quart, it&#39;s that good.

The restaurant is counter service; and they&#39;ve very efficient and friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed my first trip there, and I look forward to going again soon."

The attendant was very friendly, and the service was prompt. The potato pierogi were fresh and fluffy. They had a perfect, slight crispness on the outside. I went with the mushroom sauce which was good but a bit rich for me. I imagined more of a mushroom gravy than a cheese sauce. I think I&#39;ll go for traditional style with sautéed onions next time. I also found out I could do half and half between pork and potato ones with my six piece order. I&#39;ll definitely need to try the pork ones! Overall, the food was fresh and a great value."

The service was nice and quick. The gal at the counter explained our choices to us to make sure it was what we wanted.

This restaurant is housed in an old fast food building and is pretty unassuming, but the food shines.

I really liked the spinach and feta sautéed with the onion and sour cream topping.  

They do have entrees such as goulash, stuffed cabbage, and a street sandwich (delish!).  And, they have really good pastries!  If you are really into their pierogis, you can take home twelve frozen ones for the price of four fresh ones.

I love dumplings of all kind, and I love potatoes, cheese, onions, sauerkraut. Now imagine that enveloped in dumpling form. It&#39;s delicious. 

My favorite way to have them is sautéed. They also will cook them for you if you want them boiled or deep fried, but go with the sautéed please. Crunchy exterior with a soft, flavorful filling. It&#39;s the BEST.

Periodically I get a bee in my bonnet and attempt to make my own, which normally results in lots of cursing and sub-par pierogies (seriously, folks, don&#39;t let your grandparents pass away before teaching you their secrets!)
Thankfully, Pierogies Factory exists, and I can relive my childhood without having to coat my kitchen/cats/husband in flour. 
I visited them for the third time yesterday, and it was just as tasty as the first two times. They ran a special on pork schnitzel with a side of cucumber salad (with yogurt and dill, yum!) and either 4 or 6 pierogies. For three hungry adults who just drove back from snowboarding, it was the *perfect* meal. The pork was crunchy and awesome, and smothered in mushroom gravy (which didn&#39;t make it soggy, amazingly enough!) The cucumber salad was light and the perfect palate cleanser after the dinner&#39;s star: the pierogies. We all ordered ours cooked in the traditional manner - sautéed with onions. Seriously, nothing beats their pierogies. I&#39;m actually sort of glad we live a good hour away from them because otherwise I&#39;d be eating there for lunch daily, and my waistline would hate me for it (although I should probably mention we picked up some frozen ones to make at home... ;) ). 

A few items of note:
~You can buy a bag of 12 frozen pierogies to take home for $4.99, and if you buy 5, the 6th bag is free. 
~They have a stamp card!!
~If you ask nicely, they may allow you to mix up the flavors so you can try different ones. 
~Their pastries are made in house. I had an almond paste kringle for dessert....flaky, the perfect amount of almond, and...well, wow. :) 
~It&#39;s counter service, so you order, sit, and they bring you your meal. 
~Why are you still reading this and not eating there? Go!"

But consider the fact, I&#39;ve stayed in Warsaw, Poland almost 3 weeks every month for 3 years and during my stays, I ate perogies nearly every day, so I&#39;m going to write sincerely.  As many reviews mentioned, it&#39;s not an upscale and fancy place. Prices are affordable and offering good and friendly service. But I must say I haven&#39;t eaten pierogies with such a thick dough. We ordered 6 boiled pierogie, mushroom and sauerkraut flavor with tomato sauce. It was like Chinese Dim Sum which is something I dislike. Mostly dough and fewer fillings. Tomato sauce was simply just tomato paste, nearly bland taste, nothing special.  Beef Goulash which was served with sauerkraut and 4 sautéed pierogies. We expected Goulash to be serviced with bowl, rather than just spread on the plate. Has to be!  (The taste was good though.) Also we ordered Sauerkraut salad because that is one of my favorite food. But I haven&#39;t tasted anything like this sauerkraut in Poland, Sadly...  Overall, not too bad, but not extraordinary.  I think it&#39;s fine as Polish style dishes in the U.S.  However, I wonder how many reviewers who wrote &#34;authentic pierogies&#34; have actually eaten pierogies in Poland."

I have been waiting to check this place out since it&#39;s owner is also the creator of Polished Tavern downtown, one of the few places to get decent pierogi in Denver! Pierogis Factory seems to be using the same delicious recipes! The space is small &amp; set up almost like a fast food restaurant. There are about 10 tables and a small counter where you order &amp; they call you up when your order is ready. It&#39;s nothing fancy and there is no real ambience, but if you want some authentic Polish food, it&#39;s totally worth a trip!

They are keeping the menu simple, with about a dozen polish options, and all of them looked good! I only tried pierogi today: potato &amp; cheese, pork, and sauerkraut &amp; mushroom. Potato &amp; cheese were outstanding, their pork is delicious, and the sauerkraut &amp; mushroom were good (just not as good as others I&#39;ve had.)
 
My favorite part by far though is that they are making Polish desserts!!! All of them looked delicious, and the Kringke Strip that I got was so so tasty! It was flaky, sugary perfection! Definitely try a pastry!!"

Everything on the menu is great, but the pierogies are the star of the show here.  They are prepared three ways: Boiled, Sauteed or Fried.  All are great but sauteed and fried being the best in our opinion.  You cannot go wrong with any of the filling options or any of the toppings.  Our fav toppings would be the traditional with sour cream and perfectly grilled onions or the super delish cheese sauce.  

This place is a must try.  Especially in Wheatridge/Arvada area where there is little to be found for great food.  Its very authentic and very friendly.  Its also an affordable option for dining.  Don&#39;t forget to get a punch card, because like us, you will be back!"

I&#39;m from Pittsburgh, where periogies are as common on menus as fries. And Mrs. T&#39;s can definitely fill-in in a pinch, but Pierogies Factory blows them out of the water. Like way out.

I ordered 10 of the Farmers Cheese/potato pierogies, sauteed, with the mushroom and cheese sauce. I was ravenous when I ordered, but was pleasantly annoyed (is that a thing?) that they took a few extra minutes because they were made/sauteed fresh to order! DROOL. Also, because I&#39;m a pierogie-aholic, I bought 2 dozen of the frozen ones to go (cheddar/potato and Farmers cheese/potato) for when my craving returns. I haven&#39;t made either yet.

The ambiance of The Factory could use some work, but who really cares about that when I&#39;m most likely to order take out from this place, anyway? Also, the take-out container was cardboard/porous so by the time I got home, it had absorbed more-than-I&#39;d-like of the cheese sauce. Maybe a foil liner could help with that? No star deductions because their product is seriously AMAZING and perhaps I&#39;m just being picky. 

Also noteworthy are the phrases I used while describing them to my husband: &#34;Tastes like home!&#34; and &#34;It&#39;s like I couldn&#39;t get them in my mouth fast enough.&#34;

Go try it and fall in love with their tasty tasty noms. :)"

For some reason my phone had a VERY hard time locating this place. But once I found it, I enjoyed it. The meat pierogie was my least favorite, and I really enjoyed the potato &amp; cheese one the best. For toppings I got the carmelized onions and sour cream and it went well with all the pierogies.

YUM!

This place is great; the price is great; the food is great.  

I&#39;m not being terribly eloquent on this review, and I feel slightly bad for it, but it&#39;s because I&#39;m reliving the joy of shoveling these pierogies into my face.  They will fry them, or steam them, they come in platters of six or ten, and for a fee you can mix and match.  I will admit, I went for the old standbys: Potato-and-Cheese, Pork, and Potato-and-Onion all topped with sour cream and onion.

The decor is definitely spartan (it appears to have been a Taco Bell in the mid 80s) and they seem to be new in this location, as Street View has it as something else completely.

My six pierogi (2 kapusta, 2 meat, 2 potato &amp; cheese) were delicious and gone way too quickly!! They easily could charge more; I thought 6 bucks was a deal. Just put your saved cash toward a tip for the kitchen &amp; servers. 

No frills to the dining space, but I was happy to have the fast, casual option instead of going into Denver to check out their lounge/restaurant. 

My only disappointment was that there were no Polish desserts. That being said, the cinnamon stick was also delicious.

Support this small business!"

I love me some pierogies and I&#39;m pretty happy this place exists at all, seeing as Denver is not exactly flush with eastern European food. The dining area is a little sparse and it looks like they get pretty crowded, but the food is great and the service is pretty good. It takes a while to get your food, but it seems like they prepare everything to order. It&#39;s also worth the wait.

Very unsuspecting restaurant in an old taco fast food building. My husband and I had the 10 pierogies plate, sauerkraut salad and a filled donut (sorry, don&#39;t know the official name for the dessert). Loved our food, and was pleasantly surprised by how good the sauerkraut salad was. In addition to selecting the filling for your pierogies, you select a topping, and how it is cooked (boiled, sauteed or fried). All of the food was delicious, and the service was very friendly. We ate there, and it somewhat lacked in atmosphere, but with food so good, it didn&#39;t matter."

The restaurant is an old Taco Hell building, but has been sufficiently redesigned inside to be original. The owner is extremely nice and will answer all of your questions about the different dishes. But the star of this place is the food!!  Fresh handmade pierogis, goulash, and kielbasa to die for. Don&#39;t even get me started on the desserts that they make themselves.

Other reviews have already done a better job of describing why you should come here. I am not Polish but for the first six years of my life I was babysat by a Polish grandmother down the street, and the smells and the flavors totally take me back. Except for the spinach feta pierogi, but that just keeps things interesting. The mushroom and sauerkraut pierogis are to DIE for!

I agree with what everyone else is saying about this place being the single best incarnation of this building. 

It&#39;s on the west side of Wadsworth, directly across from Safeway&#39;s gas pumps, I point out the location as a public service because it is a little set back and you don&#39;t want to miss it. If you&#39;re at Jiffy Lube, do yourself a favor and wait for your car over here.

To top it off, they have a loyalty punch card. Like I&#39;m gonna need that to come back."

Huevos rancheros were great: big portions of spicy green chili on the perfectly-done eggs, fresh rice, tasty beans, and hot corn tortillas.  Went down so well with a couple of daytime-beers.

Waitress we had was great as well: very polite, fun, prompt, clean, and kept checking on us to make sure we were doing alright.

Helpful suggestions about menu. I started with the Ceviche Mixto. Eating ceviche in the Rockies, I had some trepidation - no fella though. I felt like I was in Acapulco again, sitting on the beach. The cheerful, bright interior definitely helped. The dish had the right zip to it, crunchy freshness of the onions and the bite of lime enhanced the gorgeous fish, shrimp and octopus. I just smiled as I enjoyed it all.

Salsa was well balanced and had a great burn. Chips fresh.

I ordered Tacos Macho, based on recommendations. Spot on. Que sabor! Flavor satisfied all my desires - beautiful, simple food that made me happy.  What more could you want?

Tamale was one of the best examples, I have eaten in Denver.  Boyfreind had the macho burrito, he loved it. I think the huevos were 6.99$ and the massive forearm sized burrito like 8.99.

I&#39;ve tried a lot of their dishes: Crispy chile rellenos, burritos, enchiladas, molcajetes... The mole is incredible! Seriously, EVERYTHING is delicious. The only thing I wouldn&#39;t recommend is the fajitas, but why would you order fajitas at a place like this that has authentic food. That would just be silly. (Yes, I did once.Silly me. I was missing my mom and she loves fajitas. Oh, nevermind.) The service is very friendly and very good. The prices are reasonable. They&#39;re open every day. You can even watch TV in Spanish.

It is a very small place on federal that doesn&#39;t look much like a restaurant, so the first time we decided to keep driving. After it was recommended to us by some friends, we decided to give it a try, and so glad we did! It was very good, the service was wonderful/ staff was friendly. Our food was hot and seasoned very well! Portions were large also. I tried the pazole, and it is the best I have had in Colorado (in fact one of the only places I have found that serves real pazole and not just manudo). The tacos mucho were also very good if you like spicy. We ended with the churros which were very good! Definitely worth a stop (don&#39;t just drive by this place)."

Having them open up close to our house made her quite happy.

We&#39;ve been here for lunch and breakfast, I&#39;ve sampled quite a few items.  Their steak and chorizo are both very flavorful.  The tacos are of a good size, my first visit I ordered three, and quickly learned that two is plenty.  Their diablo sauce is really good, and they have some excellent creations on their menu using different salsas.

We like to sit at the bar, service can be a little hit-or-miss, I have sometimes gotten the feeling that a bartender didn&#39;t really want us their, but they&#39;ve never been rude.

Overall they have pretty decent tacos, like most places it&#39;s best to sample until you find what suits your tastes and establish that as your go-to order when you come."

WHO: Just lil&#39; ol&#39; me.

WHERE: Torchy&#39;s of course!

WHEN: I stopped by lust before the lunch rush on a Thursday. To my surprise there was no line. Woot!

WHY: To quench my taco craving and check out a new hot business.

WHAT: Good things always come in threes, so why would tacos be any different. I noshed on the Baja Shrimp taco, the Trailer Park taco (trashy of course), and the Fried Avocado taco. They were all super tasty and had tons of flavor! They also offer Maine Root sodas from the fountain in a variety of flavors like black cherry, root beer, cola, etc... as well.

As other reviewers mentioned, is that the service was somewhat lackluster. You order, grab a seat with your number, tacos are dropped off, as you eat someone will stop by and take away your baskets. Not bad, but not the best. At one point a woman, who I&#39;m assuming was the manager, stopped by to check and insure my food was alright. That&#39;s just about all your interaction with the staff. 

Def going to be back for some more damn good tacos in the future!"

Since then Torchy&#39;s have grown on me quite a bit.  Yeah sure they&#39;re not authentic by any means, but each taco is creative and unique.  What I like most is the sauce that accompanies these generously portioned tacos.  My favorite has got to be the trailer park which is comprised of a fried chicken tender, almost reminiscent of a wrap I guess.  You can also make it &#34;trashy&#34; where they substitute lettuce for queso or keep the lettuce and make it trashy anyway I like do.  Green chili pork is good, also the democrat.  What I didn&#39;t particularly cared for was the Mr. Pink I thought that fish taco was way too fishy tasting for my liking."

I asked the busser if he thought they would sell me some, and he came right back with a container FULL of mangoes!!!! Great service, great food, full bar, what more could you ask for? I&#39;ll be back to try some other versions of tacos and definitely to get the brushfire again!
Oh! They also have some great kids meal options for around $2-$3! Something that annoys me is inflated kids meal prices. These prices are right and so are the portions, my kid almost actually finished her meal for once, plus all those mangoes!"

Here&#39;s my take on Torchy&#39;s:

- A lot of hype for Americanized taco&#39;s and not worth any amount of wait
- The fried chicken taco is scrumptious and would be perfect to cure a hangover
- Delicious queso that&#39;s good enough to drink
- Lackluster service at the counter and the bar

The tacos are good, not great and certainly not worth waiting in a line.  The lack of service is just yet another reason I won&#39;t be coming back in the near future.  I wish Torchy&#39;s luck with their Denver expansion and hope service improves over time - this will be necessary if they&#39;re looking for any kind longevity in Denver."

I especially love that you order &amp; pay at the counter and your food is delivered to you -- just makes for a smooth exit when you&#39;re ready to leave.

They are HUGE, delicious tacos and the queso is to die for also. The Stapleton location is closest to us, but my husband goes to the Broadway location for lunch near his office. 

My favorites are the fried avocado and the trashy trailer park (skip lettuce, sub queso). I also love that they have LOCAL beer on tap. My husband&#39;s favorite is the Democrat. I want to try them all, but I love the avocado and trailer park so much that I don&#39;t like straying from them. 

Beware, they don&#39;t have a specific kids menu, but my 7 year old loves them anyway. Her favorite is also the fried avocado hold the tomatoes (weirdo). If you don&#39;t get any alcohol, a family of 3 can easily eat for $25 or under. 

Just beware, depending what time you go you could encounter a long line, and if you get behind people who have never been before it could feel like an eternity. The bright side is, once you place your order, you&#39;ll have it in about 5 minutes."

I had three tacos + the Mexican corn but I would have totally been full off of 2 tacos + the corn (roasted off-the-cob corn with ancho aioli, queso fresco, cilantro, chile powder). The tacos are street-style tacos but there are tons of toppings on it so they become larger than your average taco. I&#39;ve never been to the Torchy&#39;s in TX so I have nothing to compare this place to. The tacos I had:

-trailer park: fried chicken, green chile, lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese, flour tortilla, poblano sauce 
-fried avocado: hand-battered avocado with refried greens, pico, lettuce, cheese, poblano sauce and corn tortilla 
-Mr. Orange: blackened salmon, grilled corn, black bean relish, queso fresco, avocado salsa, lime, corn tortilla 

They seem to have a bar with a bunch of alcohol and cocktails as well. The ordering style is casual. you line up, order your food, take a number and they bring your food to you. They have breakfast tacos that are served all day for you breakfast-loving folks. They also have a couple dessert options that includes brownies and cookies. I would definitely order the street corn. That stuff was delicious. Don&#39;t forget to squeeze some lime onto it. The ambience is fun and there are plenty of indoor tables."

Colfax and Pinche Taqueria (Tacos Tequila Whisky) also on Colfax where 3-4 constitute meal size portions.  These are massive, bring reinforcements!  

That said, the queso and the tacos my husband and I tried were tasty!  Both of us tried the Republican (which I wouldn&#39;t do again) and the Green Chili Pork (favorite).  I must say, in Denver you can do so much better, and that isn&#39;t even taking into consideration the loud, inebriated, sales conglomerate at the next table over.

I was utterly disappointed. First the wait to grab a couple tacos to go was over twenty minutes. Which was sad. The tacos were not hot when they go to to us. Anyway, the avocado taco was okay not overly flavorful but fine. The meat tacos (we tried about 3 different ones) were okay. They didn&#39;t stand out. There was nothing that had me making yum sounds as a gobbled it up. It was not worth the wait. I probably wont go back.

The service was friendly and the wait was maybe 10 min after the order. The menu and taco name items are FUN. I got the trailer park fried chicken one on flour tortilla and the pork democrat one with an assortment of their salsas. Both were good but nothing overly exciting for me. Each were labeled and wrapped nicely in foil. I had a take out order since most of my friends wanted FIVE GUYS and Tokyo Joes next door after our Long morning at a cider place.  Both tacos I ordered were devoured... But the flavors were Nothing Id crave. It was a delicious lunch but I may need to try other styles they offer. The Torchy&#39;s experience was just a Mediocre taco to me 
I&#39;ll be back to try more of their selection, menu, and some there. I do hope to try their breakfast ones but after this first experience I don&#39;t really agree with the hype on these tacos."

We biked over to Torchy&#39;s early one morning with our hearts set on breakfast tacos. We ordered a variety and biked home to eat our tacos on the couch, in our pjs with the Sunday cartoons. Because that&#39;s what Sunday&#39;s are all about right?

Unfortunately of our 4 tacos, The Smoked Brisket Wrangler, Migas and a #3 and #5, two of them were filled with raw potatoes. If we hadn&#39;t already biked home we would&#39;ve gone right back and requested new tacos but instead we picked out all the potatoes and ate our, now sad, tacos. I will say the brisket was fabulous, perfectly cooked and delicious/ potato free.

Final comment...they have a fabulous &#34;Text to let us know&#34; how your meal was sticker on their receipts. Love it! So that&#39;s what I did. I want to give every business the benefit of the doubt. It&#39;s been over two weeks now since I sent that text and I never heard a word. So much for feeling like your voice was heard! Alas...I&#39;ve come to yelp! 

Sorry folks, beware of the breakfast potatoes and examine your order before you leave!"

I Specifically ordered a gluten free fried avocado taco, reiterated that it was an allergy. It came to the table battered and clearly not gluten free. I kindly brought it to the attention of my waitress and she brought it back. My family proceeded to eat and FINISH their meal, and over the span of 20 minutes they could not flash fry a freaking avocado and put it on a corn tortilla. I had to ask 3 times and it took 30 minutes. Really irritating and the waitress seemed irritated at ME. The manager on duty said it got lost in line, which I think is just a way of saying the waitress forgot to let the kitchen know to make a new one. Too bad because the food is good."

The atmosphere is somewhere between a bar and a fast food restaurant, and the food is probably also somewhere between those two standards.  I tried the Republican, the Green Chile Pork, and the Crossroads.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;d recommend the republican, it was more or less a glorified hot dog on a tortilla.  The other two were much more impressive, especially the Crossroads, and there are plenty of other decent looking tacos on the menu.

Trouble is, nothing here really blows me away.  If you&#39;re looking for more authentic tacos, then Tacos y Salsas and Taco Mex are both fairly close and MUCH better.  If you&#39;re looking for someone&#39;s creative spin on street tacos, then both Odelay Tacos and Pinche Taqueria are close, and MUCH better.  If you&#39;re at the mall and just want some tacos, then this place is within walking distance.

Side note: these tacos are a lot bigger than a typical street taco.  If you&#39;re REALLY hungry, three will easily be enough.  If you&#39;re not starved, probably just get two."

The Jamaican Jerk Chicken is unreal.  Pair it with the Diablo hot sauce and you got a DAMN GOOD taco as promised by the slogan.

Another DAMN GOOD option is the Brushfire with the smoked brisket!

Also, try the Green Chili taco.  All of the tacos are amazingly flavorful on their own.  The sauces are the bonus."

I&#39;m not a big fan of Denver and this location is much more convenient for me. It was pretty busy during lunch on a Monday but we were prepared for that. 

We ordered chips and queso as an appetizer. They brought this to our table within five minutes. We were glad we ordered an appetizer because it took about 20 minutes for our meal to arrive. The queso was fantastic! Very different from what I&#39;m used to getting but still great. I&#39;m still thinking about it two weeks later. I had a breakfast taco (the egg and potato with no meat) and the chicken fajita. Both were good but I preferred the chicken taco. Unfortunately they brought the wrong salsas but the ones they brought were fine. My husband had a burrito (very messy, needed a knife and fork because it was falling apart) and the shrimp taco. He loved both. He got the spiciest salsa which wasn&#39;t the least bit hot. Since I was served the wrong salsa I&#39;m not sure he was served the correct salsa either. 

The service was very friendly. Cost is fairly comparable to Chipotle and in my opinion you get better options. With an appetizer and two meals it was about $25. We spend about $20 at Chipotle for three burritos, a few more dollars for chips and guacamole. We will definitely be back here to try more tacos."

Ordered the Democrat, and got a wire in the Barbacoa. You would think this would be a negative review but just the opposite! The customer service was SO good and the food so amazing that it was seriously no big deal (the brushes used to clean a lot or dishes in restaurants have old wires that sometimes come loose.) they made everything right and gave us some compensation as well. The food was very good, with tastes that were unique enough to make it interesting but kept the palate wanting to have more. Recommend buying two tacos though; they&#39;re kind of small."

I recently moved to Denver so when I found out there was a Torchy&#39;s down the street from the office, I was thrilled. The interior was definitely more flashy and more upscale than the one I&#39;ve been to, and there&#39;s a really nice bar area that opens up to the patio. *Hint: someone told me that it&#39;s quicker to order your tacos at the bar if the line is too long at the counter! 

I&#39;ve been here a few times to make my way through the menu and everything is good, but not nearly as great as it&#39;s Texan counterpart. I believe that they&#39;re still working out the kinks because some of the tacos are cooked inconsistently, but the flavors are all there. The salmon for the Mr. Orange was a small piece of overcooked fish, though still good with the rest of the fixings. Same with the trailer park- the fried chicken was not spectacular and a little small, but the sauce that goes with it is always awesome. I recommend the Green Chile Pork and the Democrat, always flavorful and well filled! 

If you&#39;re thinking about whether or not you want 2 or 3 tacos, do 2 and go for the chips and queso. It is a heavenly experience that you can&#39;t pass up and trumps everything else on the menu. 

Service is not so good, to be honest. A bunch of younger kids that need to be trained a little bit more. This is hard because there&#39;s always a huge corporate lunch rush and the food takes a while to come out too, so this slows it down a little more. 

Other than that, Torchy&#39;s is definitely worth checking out if you have time and won&#39;t disappoint once the food hits the table. They also have cool tacos of the month to experiment with some new flavors, regardless of their already extensive menu."

We love the set up of the indoor/outdoor seating. The food is pretty good. We had the Western  and the Crossroads. The Western was a good combination  of eggs, potatoes and brisket. The avocado  sauce is da bomb and sets the taco off. The Crossroads was good as well  though the brisket was over cooked.
We feel the tacos are a little overpriced tho the portions are decent. Main complaints are how the line to order is set up, it is short so very congested, the wait time for food and the selection of fountain drinks. Would like to see regular Pepsi  or Coke products  added.  Overall both times have been good experiences  and we will retun."

Very unorganized? Not trained? 

Order at register but of you want alcohol they may not can help you but can send you to the bar to order which isn&#39;t great after waiting awhile in line. 

May not get a receipt.

You do not get water unless you order it so after you finish your margarita, better hope your food isn&#39;t spicy as there is no option for another drink without waiting in line again for however long that takes. We plan to stop somewhere AFTER we leave and get a drink.

TIP: if you want alcohol, go to bar to order everything. Learned this the hard way.

Food is awesome, love the queso, avocado tacos and fried chicken tacos especially. Everything had flavor and want to try more!

Do not love that three peoples food comes out at different times, one being 15 minutes later so polite people either eat cold food or just go ahead and then wait in the last person to finish.

Also food has a 50/50 shot of being right and if wrong, that&#39;s another 10 minutes at least while they start over.

In the time we were there, every table in view sent them away because of a order mistake and I wasn&#39;t the only one chasing servers down to find out about missing food.

Maybe wait another month or more before you try or only go if they look less busy."

We&#39;ve been here a number of times and although the food is consistently awesome, the service is consistently slow and they always seem understaffed. We took my parents last Sunday after the Broncos game around 6:30. There was a line, to be expected, and we ordered around 7 - 8 tacos, chips and queso (SO GOOD) and drinks. There were two people taking orders, two bartenders and then it looked like only two food runners/bussers. We got our drinks and chips in about 5 minutes, which was awesome .... but the at 7:50 we still didn&#39;t have our tacos. I went to go find someone, told the first person I saw and she said she&#39;d let someone know and follow up. 10 minutes later, no one had some by, so I went to talk to the bartender and to ask for a manager. There was a manager at the computer and I told him what was going on - he didn&#39;t turn around to talk to me but just said our order had been lost and that they were making it now and that they would refund our meal. Super appreciated!! However, our food didn&#39;t come until 8:25 and even then it was brought to us as a to-go order and all out tacos were cold. We were so disappointed!!

They person that brought our food out was nice about us asking for a remake of the tacos. They didn&#39;t have the ingredients on it like avocado, etc, so it&#39;s not just because of the onions. I still can&#39;t get over how many onions, there was more onions than shredded cheese. My husband and I both got the chicken and the democrat, he got his plain, meat only, and said it was delicious. When my remade tacos came out, there was only one, the waitress replied with oh, you wanted both remade, why yes, I do believe that&#39;s what we agreed on several times. I sucked it up and ate it anyway. The chicken was better than the beef, which while it had avocado on it this time and no onions they added in the cilantro I didn&#39;t want before.

This place is fantastic. The food is always hot, the ingredients taste fresh, and the flavors seem to all just come together really well. The only downside to Torchy&#39;s can sometimes be that the wait can be longer than expected, or the service kind of slow, but I tell you, once the food arrives all reservations or doubts over your selection or venue of place to eat go out the door. My favorites would be the &#34;BrushFire&#34; and the &#34;Baja Shrim&#34; I&#39;ve had the &#34;Trailer Park&#34; extra &#34;trashy&#34;, and one of their breakfast tacos as well. (Dirty Sanchez) Breakfast taco was good, but just okay, nothing spectacular. Trailer park would have been better if it didn&#39;t seem the fried chicken was cold/dry/overcooked most likely. The sauces they offer with everything are awesome, but when they say one is hot, if you like hot go for the ones above it. The sauces are extremely mild in all cases. The real MVP a must have everytime I go here would have to be the chips and queso. The cheese, and the cilantro mix are the winning combo in this dish. INCREDIBLE! I took my friend here once for a business/catch up meet, he now brings his son here regularly. People watching while you eat is definitely advised. One of my favorite parts is watching servers scout around for the numbers correlating to the order they are carrying, looking lost in the sauce. Good times, have fun!"

These tacos are without a doubt very filling.  I am used to eating 5-6 street tacos and here I was full with two even though I ordered three.  I liked the one with Barbacoa and been fajita over the chicken.  It might seem pricey but the tacos are huge!

There was no music though but we settled for the faint music playing at the restaurant across the street.

Again, I could deal with a a little slowness, but everyone says it&#39;s quick.  When our food arrived, it everyone&#39;s was cold.  My son&#39;s chicken taco from the kids menu was a joke as the chicken was very cold - so much that the cheese couldn&#39;t/didn&#39;t melt at all.  I had Mr. Pink and Mr. Orange with corn tortilla&#39;s... the tortilla was cold and falling apart.  I highly recommend the flour over the corn.  My other son had the Mr Pink on the flour and it stayed together, but again, was just above room temperature.  

My kids, 10 &amp; 11, don&#39;t care to go back and I&#39;m not planning to go either... my food was cold and fell apart. Flavoring was decent, though."

Super creative taco options here in a large, open space. Only setback was if you want to order beer you can order it with your tacos/main food items and the bar (separate from where you order) will bring to your table. The bartenders totally missed the order coming in and didn&#39;t get us our beer for about 25 min. It wasn&#39;t super crowded either so not sure what the hold up was for. This is also on the heavier side as it&#39;s Tex-Mex (but that queso is worth it!)."

This will help determine if your sensory organs on your tongue will really enjoy the experience! When we got started I felt like we were in a sea of tacos! We ordered at least five different options (see pics below) along with guacamole and chips! Our hands were moving from one taco to another, like those of an octopus as we took bites of different tacos! I have to say my favorite was the Baja Shrimp! I was thanking my tastebuds for allowing me to appreciate the fried shrimp and perfect chipotle #goooodness. My tastebuds didn&#39;t however enjoy the Green Chili Pork! That cheese and pork combination were stomach churning! Seriously, I could only eat one bite...and that&#39;s not like me... I love food!

They give you a number, which the staff uses to bring your food to your table.  The counter line can get very long.  Ordering can be confusing as there is no frame of reference as to the size of each dish.  The dish sizes are underwhelming for the price.  Tacos are street-taco sized, and you only get one.  Very small portions.  At least offer two streat tacos for the price they charge.

The service is also very slow.  They seem to suffer from some kitchen inefficiencies.  From the time you enter the store and finally receive you food, you could have lost half of your lunch hour...all for one tiny taco.  

The tacos also seem to be a hit and miss as to taste.  You really have to experiment to find a taco you&#39;ll like.  

Not worth the time and money."

We ordered three tacos (Brushfire, Democrat, and Baja Shrimp), a steak burrito, street corn, kids bean, cheese and chicken tacos and quesadillas. Fountain drinks.

The Democrat (with barbacoa) was bland. Hardly any taste at all, and that was with all the salsa dumped on it. The Brushfire (jerk chicken) was gross. I took a couple of bites before spitting out my last attempt. The Baja Shrimp was good, but it had very little of the slaw that it&#39;s topped with, and I wanted more. None of the tortillas on any of the tacos were very good. The flour ones were really low quality, and the corn ones were cooked funny and came out kind of rubbery. The portion size&#39;s were  not what I expected for $4-5 tacos. Overall, a very poor taco experience for a taco place. 

The burrito was ok, but probably not even as good as Chipotle, which isn&#39;t great or anything. Portion size was adequate, but I wouldn&#39;t know this burrito from any of a million &#34;meh&#34; burritos anywhere. 

The &#34;Street Corn&#34; was ok, but it wasn&#39;t street corn. Street corn comes on  the cob. This was served in a bowl, and they don&#39;t tell you on the menu that it&#39;s served that way. So if you&#39;re expecting actual street corn, as we were, you will be disappointed. Plus, it had way too much chipotle aioli, and the $4 was obscene considering the portion.

My kids said they did not like their food at all, and it certainly did not look appealing in the least.

This was not good food, and it definitely was not $45 worth of food for a place with no servers and where you bus your own table.

We won&#39;t be back."

Accompanied by glorious 00&#39;s pop music, the Japanese-themed walls put us at ease and relaxation. Our server, Dong, was friendly and very helpful throughout our dining experience. 

Our ramen arrived quickly and was surprisingly loaded with 4 fat slices of chashu (most other ramen places might serve only 2!). Overall we all enjoyed our ramen (especially the Tonkotsu!) very much. My one suggestion is that the noodles could benefit from a heavier broth! Also, my pork slices were cold, so chewing into it initially was a bit surprising."

The noodles. They are all properly done. The rest like they say is all in there. Portion to bowl ratio? Perfect! 

The location is awesome if you want to be where the heart of d/t DENVER is. It is after all on 16th St. People walk on this street. Because you can&#39;t drive. Duh. 

Met up with Pete G. This was his suggestion. Thanks Pete! I would&#39;ve never come this way for ramen. 

There&#39;s parking in the same building. I found it by accident. You will come out right next to Menya! Entrance to the garage is on Champa. If you park next to the 16th St elevator and take it down to the same St all you have to do is make a right out the door and you&#39;re right next to this yummy ramen restaurant.

We sat outside and chatted and people watched. Time flew by. Pretty soon goodbyes were said. But no goodbyes for Menya. I will be back to check out their inside and to try their other flavors. Can&#39;t wait!"

Food: I ended up ordering the spicy chicken ramen and it turned out really good, also ordered the shoyu Togo for my girlfriend and she enjoyed it. Decent portions and great cost for a place on 16th street mall. It was 23$ for 2 ramens.

Service: service was good, I first ordered the tonkotsu and soon after saw a poster for the spicy chicken ramen. I was talking to my buddies about I should have ordered that and the waiter heard and came to ask me if I wanted to switch. He was always there when we needed, but it was a bit slow that day."

White rice was $2 extra, which seemed strange, but he bit the bullet and got that too. It took a while for food to arrive and when it did, it was only my friend&#39;s food. He was a few bites away from completely finished with his meal when my ramen finally showed up. 

Mine was tasty, but mostly noodles with only a stray shrimp, squid ring, or scallop here and there. He said he enjoyed his chicken teriyaki, but if I hadn&#39;t insisted he eat, it would have been stone cold by the time my food arrived. The server was apologetic and told us the kitchen was slow today once we both had our food, but she ghosted in the time between each order arriving."

I had the seafood ramen, which the waiter said was his favorite. The portion is huge! And it is full of shrimp, squid and scallops. Some places have a tendency to over salt their ramen. Not here!!n the broth was light and perfect!

Since I&#39;m not an athlete (only workout at the gym and run a small race for fun) I came to the highest peak to eat! My first day in Denver was awesome. I took a long walk on 16th street Mall. I visited the Money Museum so that I won&#39;t go broke while in Denver. I entered some small restaurants to check on their menu lunches, I took photos of the street, I enjoyed watching the hybrid buses go up and down the street. Then I ended-up here because I thought the soup photos looked delicious. They have outside seating so I chose that because I was a tourist. Since hubby&#39;s busy working, I enjoyed my delicious seafood soup. The broth was incredible. It&#39;s all about the broth when you the soup. Sitting outside is nothing like  Fifth Avenue in NY. It was super pleasant to eat outside here. The weather was nice that day and there&#39;s no cars except the 2 hybrid buses allows on this street running thru  narrow lanes. I loved it. I got 25% off from checking-in the place so I ordered a cheese cake  woohoo! How kind. I&#39;m so kind to myself. Just don&#39;t order more. The price was reasonable although it&#39;s a huge bowl of soup. They gave me that tiny bean sprouts (loved those!). I mentioned it to hubby about my soup  experience.

Kara-age came out halfway through our meal... the fried squid legs were awesome but the fried chicken was just ok... kinda dry for dark meat and flavor was again lacking.

I will preface this review by saying I am an Asian food snob that has spent a lot of time in Asia and SoCal, so my standards are admittedly high. I have been to this location on two occasions once after an evening of hanging out with friends and imbibing a good amount of beer (that night the food was on point...or at least I think I remember it being on point). The second time was the other day after work on a Monday around 7:00. 

The place was severely understaffed the poor front counter guy said it was him and one other waitstaff and the kitchen staff  (only two guys). I&#39;m and understanding person, so it wasn&#39;t too big of a deal, but lets be real a ramen noodle shop shouldn&#39;t be an hour and half experience. 

Ordered the Shoyu Ramen and the Sencha tea....Sencha was on point bitter and delightful. 
The Shoyu was missing half the accompaniments and looked as though it had been hastily thrown in the bowl. I&#39;m not a huge stickler on the presentation, it is all going to the same place and should taste the same regardless, but it was a shock because the first visit was characterized with amazing presentation. 

I will say the shoyu broth was a bit greasy this go round, but there was noticeably more meat and the additional egg ($1) was perfectly cooked. 

Would I go again, absolutely who can say no to $9 ramen? But I do think management needs to take consistency and adequate staffing into consideration moving forward."

Yakisoba had a delicious flavor, actually grilled. It was super flavorful but a little too saucy. The bottom was just sauce... Made me a little sad. 
Chicken karaage was amazing! Perfect amount of crispy and tender. A must try!

The waitress was prompt and seated me immediately. I love ramen very much and grew up on ramen, so I definitely had high expectation for this place because this restaurant specializes in ramen. I think that this place has huge potential. I just wish they would strictly focus on ramen and tapas instead of sushi as a side. I just don&#39;t think that works cohesively. In Japan, ramen shops are strictly ramen shops, so adding sushi, I think can ruin the quality and the craftsmanship of the ramen. I had their miso ramen and it was delicious. The noodles were cooked al dente and the broth had depth to it. I just felt like there was something missing, but overall, the flavors were there. Id like to come back again and try a different noodle dish."

Not bad for people new in town. Great location for this business since you walk by it at 16th street mall (when you get hungry from walking/shopping). Reasonable prices and tasteful menu. We ordered the chashu ramen, gyoza and tempura don. All were delicious but it tasted to me that the ramen was not made by hand or from scratch. Maybe pre packaged noodles. Yet the taste was okay. Not too salty or the broth too overpowering to taste. I also noticed that they did not have any katsudon on the menu. Maybe because it was primarily a noodle bar.

Appetizer came out after main course, this was because the kitchen was really backed up. The place was PACKED! Other people seem to like it, but to me this was a sad excuse for noodles which is usually a great meal. Don&#39;t come here if your in a hurry. It seems to get busy and things slow down.

I was at the convention center for a conference, and came here with a couple people that I had just met there.

Since we were visiting 16th Street Mall, there were plenty of choices.  But we all agreed on Menya Noodle Bar as the place to try.  We stepped in and took a look at the menu and liked what we saw.  It was crowded (always a good sign) and we got one of the last few free tables outside.  It was such a nice day out, we were happy to get this spot.  The dishes we saw at the other tables all looked good.  I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t just because I was hungry.  Everything truly looked tasty.

After taking a few minutes to decide, our waiter came back for our order.  We went with the Udon Bowl, Tantan Men and Seafood Men.  An order of Tako Yaki started our meal.  Deep fried wheat cake with a choice of octopus or shrimp. It was a fantastic start!  The incredible sauce (which I scraped off the bowl with my chopsticks) really made the dish!  I would have happily eaten all of them.  But I controlled myself  :).  When the bowls came, they were all filled to the full.  My son&#39;t Tantan Men had a great color to it and had a little spice to it when I tried it.  I didn&#39;t try my daughter&#39;s Udon, but the broth looked clear and delicious.  My Seafood Men was fantastic.  It had a good quantity of seafood (shrimp, calamari, scallops) and the chicken broth was clean and flavorful.  Each of us was happy with their choice.  They were not able to finish theirs, but I ate mine down to the last drop.  A very filling meal.  Menya would get my business any day."

I&#39;ve had the Tantanmen, Tonkotsu and Spicy Ramen bowls - the broth was flavorful and the noodles are actually very light.  The table spices are also very nice.

We ordered the shishito peppers once - meh, they were average and definitely overkill for lunch.

The hot tea is served in really neat pots - I embarrassed myself initially by trying to pour out the top of the pot, but the server saved me...I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s done that.

My noodle obsession loves this place..it is always great to have another option when it comes to ramen (or any noodles for that matter). I really dig their menu..on top of quite a few ramen options they also have some rice bowls and other plates. I went for the tan tan men ramen. The creamy pork broth is amazing. I don&#39;t think the other shops I have been to around town have a broth like this..or at least not as creamy awesome as this! The spicy pork topping was great too. Coupled with a few squirts of the chili sauce the heat was great. I am excited to go back and try the miso/shoyu ramens and see how they compare with the other shops in town!

The price is right too $9-10 for a good sized bowl. A good $5 cheaper than Osaka. The service was good too..our server gave some solid recommendations to my friends that couldn&#39;t decide. Since it is new it was a little busy during lunch but for our group of three we sat at the bar and didn&#39;t have any trouble at 1130ish. I think around 12-1230 there can be a bit of a wait though.

Being located downtown makes it easy to get to if you work in the city and the quality of ingredients as well as the amount of food are both perfect.  The spicy miso ramen is actually spicy, which can be a rare find as most places offer a mere mild and the Age Dashi Tofu is a must order starter.

As it is a downtown restaurant be sure to come a bit early as the place packs in the people around 12."

The takoyaki was crispy on the outside with a soft center with octopus in the center which is what delicious takoyaki should be. The spicy miso ramen was very flavorful and the noodles were chewy which we loved. The chasu was very tender. 
The only quibbles we had were on broth temperature, garlic, and bean sprouts. 
We wished the broth was hotter. We prefer our broth extra hot (in temperature) almost boiling.  The broth also had a strong garlic flavor, which we enjoyed but others may not like. The ramen also had a lot of bean sprouts which added a great crunch most of our party enjoyed but one person doesn&#39;t like bean sprouts so she picked it out.

I got the tantan men and it lacked flavor, so I added the red spicy sauce that was in the table which made it a little better. If you&#39;re into traditional ramen, you would love the season hard boiled egg they put in the ramen. Menya doesn&#39;t provide any eggs with their ramen which was disappointing. 

On the other hand the waiters were extremely kind and we got our food fairly quickly although it was busy on a Friday afternoon. Would come back if I was in the area I guess."

On my first visit I had the Shrimp Tempura, Dumplings and Chicken Karage. The Shrimp Tempura was tasty, but the rice was depressingly chewy (imagine the texture of bubble gum).  The Chicken Karage was downright tough; however, the dumplings were good.

Today I returned for more of the Shrimp Tempura, which was good, but it was served with the same depressingly chewy rice.  And, I tried the Chasu Bowl (pork belly over rice).  The few slivers of pork belly were delicious, but served over a bowl of that chewy bubble gum rice.

But here is the DISGUSTING clincher:  the glass my water was served in, was covered in a greasy film of filth, that I did not notice until I&#39;d finished drinking the entire glass--UGH!

I had to talk to three different staff members before the manager (Johnny) had the decency to come out of his office and address the issue.  Even then he preferred to placate me with nonsense about the glass being sanitized.  Really, Johnny?  So, the glass was clean but filthy?

My god, I hope I don&#39;t get sick.  But, more importantly, I hope you don&#39;t get sick from this DISGUSTING place!"

We were greeted promptly by the hostess and taken to a long table that could be shared by multiple groups of guests. The restaurant definitely was upgraded from the recent Good Times decor and seemed nicely set up with quaint seating and an expanded kitchen with a view so you could see the chefs working. The place was &#34;pretty&#34; full for an off hour between lunch and dinner.

Originally I had thought this place was like an order at the window, get your food, and choose a seat getup, but it is more of your standard host/server setup. 

It took a little longer than I would have liked for our waiter to come over and get us started with waters and to order our food. When he finally came around to us we had already picked out our dishes on the menu, which was small, but I did like how they had the pictures along with what was in the dish on the menu.

The food came out hot and fast, but I wish the portion sizes were a little larger based on the price. 

We ordered the Yasia Men ($8.25) and the Spicy Miso Men ($10). Both dishes were fairly good with nice tasting broth and noodles. The ingredients seemed fresh and the dishes overall healthy. The tables also had a range of condiments you could add to spice up or flavor your dishes. I chose to add some spicy seasoning to my broth. 

Overall, I wish they had larger portion sizes (we didn&#39;t feel very full upon leaving the restaurant..) and wish the dishes were more flavorful and addicting. It&#39;s not bad for a noodle place, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be back. I&#39;ll possibly give it another try."

I ordered the udon and green tea ice cream. The udon: either they&#39;re using pre-packaged kitsune and broth, or they&#39;re over-sweetening it, or they&#39;re southern (in which case their flavor profile will be sweet overall). Udon texture was pretty good, but the utter sweetness of the broth made it impossible for me to enjoy drinking the broth itself (which is half the battle). The green tea ice cream was very likely the Maeda-en stuff that you buy at the supermarket.

The fries are to die for, as I&#39;ve best a huge fan of their Wild dippin&#39; sauces as well as trying other food items out on the menu. My aunt even worked at this location. But a long time ago, of course. Her name was Lupe. Anyways, this location, as well as all other locations also provide their customers with outside seating benches and tables and perfectly convinced service. Their drive thru is always fast paced and on point. I love this location."

They take a bite and I touched the inside of their burritos. They were barely lukewarm. I returned to the restaurant and they were nice enough to remake their burritos and they were extra hot. But you would think that as they were bagging the original burritos they were not hot at all. But thank you for being very nice and replaced them with a smile."

This one is the only one in my area that offers a military discount. But they only pretend to do so. 

The first time that it wasn&#39;t applied they were busy and I thought it was an honest mistake. The second time they were also very busy, I didn&#39;t want to hold up the line. This most recent time I was the only one there. He swiped my card, handed me the receipt, and retreated around the corner.

Update: this hasn&#39;t happened again. I actually haven&#39;t seen the guy who kept doing it so I am giving more stars now for good food and military discount."

I ordered a double slider combo because I wanted something small. The combo comes with a small drink and fries for 3.99. He asks if I would like my combo large or the regular size (which I assumed meant the regular sized meal they have printed on their screen) I said I&#39;ll take the regular size. The kid at the window tells me my total is $5. I pull up to the window and I ask how does a 3.99 meal become $5? He tells me because of tax... I said tax isn&#39;t what&#39;s making it that much he responds well that&#39;s what my screen says.. I pay for the meal and upon looking at my receipt I noticed an upcharge for both my fries and drink which I never asked for. The kid at the window proceeds to argue with me saying that&#39;s what you ordered I said you offered me a large or the regular size so I asked for the regular size he&#39;s like well that is the regular size. I have to speak with the manager and I go through the same argument with the manager. He&#39;s like its policy to offer an upsell, which I understood but I didn&#39;t want the upsell that&#39;s why I asked for regular. He says well next time you you have to ask for the small combo. I think it&#39;s a bit crazy that you have to ask for a combo that&#39;s printed on the menu but whatever the case is I&#39;ll never come back here. Plus my food was freezing cold and my burger look like it had been cooked 6x it was disgusting."

WHY is the management of this store not staffing up the store to make orders quicker than that?  Come on, the food is decent but not worth waiting that long for.  Management, get your act together.

My basis for comparison and making that statement is 2 other Good Times I have been too, one of them in DTC.  They don&#39;t take anywhere near that long.  Maybe 2 minutes tops, but usually faster than that."

Char Shu Pork in my opinion is the best. Watch out for the green hot sauce though at the table. It&#39;s super hot, but really good if you like spicy. Really wish they would open up the lighting a bit. If you walk by you&#39;d have little idea that it was open and had customers.

My group came in last night really late (and very drunk). We didn&#39;t realize that they were closing. We were probably not the easiest to try and communicate with. As a former server I know what a pain it is when people come in at closing time. I don&#39;t even remember leaving!

I&#39;d never had tequila with ginger beer before. I&#39;m a sucker for all things ginger beer so this was a new twist.

My gf had the seared tuna burrito and, while filling up more quickly than she thought, was super happy with her choice. 

The only thing that didn&#39;t sit well was the cost. Everything on the menu feels like it&#39;s $1-$3 more expensive than it should be. It&#39;s like you&#39;re paying food truck prices but not at the food truck. It&#39;s not gonna keep me from going back, quite the opposite I&#39;m excited to go back.

This place is proving to be the exception. I&#39;ve come here twice in the past month, and I can see I&#39;ll be a regular.

So far, I&#39;ve tried the korean bbq beef (burrito), char siu pork (rice bowl), and korean bbq shrimp (tacos), plantains, and the chips and queso. All delicious! One of the servers (glasses, curly hair) doesn&#39;t hesitate to make recommendations, and she is SPOT ON every time. The complaints I have are few: tacos fall apart pretty easily and the beef is a little gristly. However, the flavor is fantastic, the service is impeccable, and the atmosphere casual and friendly.

Thankfully they are opened at their Brick and Mortar location coz we wanted to have Brunch else where in another establishment that apparently SHUT THEIR DOORs suddenly.

I did called Chuey Fu&#39;s to inform them I am bringing a group of 8 guests.  When I arrived before 10:30hrs the lovely staff, moved the HEAVY tables for us.  They are in the midst of preparing their BRUNCH Menu which is NOT out yet when we were there.

In terms of FOOD SERVICE, they can do better so as to make sure the next time we are there, it wont be slow.  

I have been to Chuey Fu&#39;s when they operate their FOOD TRUCK and which they are occasionally found @ Civic Center Eats.

I like my order of Shrimp Bowl.  My friends like their order too.  Some don&#39;t fancy as much, perhaps due to a lot of Rice in their Rice bowl, or lack of the sauce that comes with their Rice bowl etc.

YES, Chuey Fu&#39;s has potential to grow in my books.  Hope they can prosper many more years to come in this neighborhood."

We came at an odd time for lunch, about 10:30 in the morning.  While the staff was really friendly and accommodating for a large group, it seemed as if they were still getting the morning started.

The bean and corn rice bowl sounded good to me and the breakfast burrito hit the spot for the hubs.  By far and away, he ordered better than I did.  The burrito was filled with delicious chorizo and a lot of it.  My bowl was good but I would have liked more sauce to come with it.  It was a pretty basic bean and rice bowl.  I also ordered the sweet corn side dish which was good but every bit of corn stuck in my teeth which I don&#39;t love.

Foodwise - I would say &#34;meh overall.&#34; The salsa was watery and not interesting (I tend to like tangy salsa or some sort of standout flavor other than spicy and tomato), the tomalito was dry and not that tasty either, especially given how buttery it is, the ramen was so so, the Korean shrimp taco was &#34;good&#34; per my friend, portions seemed small, and all of us agreed that we probably wouldn&#39;t go back.

Good selection (bulgogi, galbi, pork, squid, bibimbop, kimchi jigae, soon dubu, katsu, teriyaki, Korean burrito), reasonable prices and the service is friendly too. Very casual - order up front and they&#39;ll let you know when your food is ready; also you throw away your own food too.

BIBIMBOP STONE BOWL WITH BEEF - $9.95
This was so tasty - I&#39;d rank as one of the best. Just be patient - the food is cooked to order so it took a while before we got our food and there wasn&#39;t anyone else in the restaurant. Still so worth it. My co-worker ordered the same thing and he absolutely loved it. Portion was generous, enough for two meals if you practice portion control. FYI we didn&#39;t get any banchan (side dishes).

GALBI PLATE - $11.95
Their galbi was very good, cooked to order and had a charbroil or chargrill flavor. Served bento style and came w/ 2 scoops rice, salad and 2 banchan (bean sprouts, japchae with veggies).

The galbi was flavorful, but unfortunately a bad choice for a burrito.  It became a messy burrito because several pieces of the galbi had to be pulled out since it was hard to bite and chew on.  One bite had a small bone in it.  The burrito temp was lukewarm to cold because of the salad I think...Lesson learned, galbi is better on a plate to eat.

Overall...I would come back to try the beef and lets hope it&#39;s easier to eat."

The parking lot is small and space could be limited with the other adjacent restaurants, but it wasn&#39;t busy and the place was empty. The decor is somewhat odd and clashing: one of the front windows is shattered (from heat?), there&#39;s various tables and chairs and lamps from IKEA, there&#39;s like a lift-up hamper for garbage, and the menu is now black marker boards in small handwriting. But it seems like the standard items are still there: bibimbap, plates, Korean burritos, etc. There are also nice wall plaques that describe in detail the menu items, such as bibimbap.

The gentleman working was friendly and helpful, explaining the menu and making suggestions. Prices are pretty reasonable. The bulgogi bibimbap took about 5 minutes and was tasty."

This is a self serve place.  Not the same owners as the previous Yelp events and pictures.  The tables and the eating area is clean but the pricing is also different than the photos posted by previous yelpers.  

The food was meh, I had the tofu soup (soon dobu) but it came in a regular soup bowl/ramen bowl, rather than the traditional clay pot.  There were only 3 sides with kimchi, bean sprouts, and shredded daikon.  I paid about the same price as some other places like Silla but have received less sides, no service, and mediocre food.  (Though I have to give it to them that they did put a lot of seafood in the soup, hence the 2nd star).

I initially intended to come here and get the ramen, but they just use instant noodle that you can purchase for less than $1 at the stores... why would I pay for someone to boil my noodles?  I make a kick-a$$ instant noodles at home I don&#39;t need to pay someone else $6 for their lamer version.  At least use fresh noodles and maybe their own seasoning rather than cheating and using pre-packaged noodles/and the spice packets.  At least they were honest about the pre-packaged noodles.  

This place is close to work but I was not impressed enough to come back."

I grew up in California, where you can just kind of assume the tiny, unpretentious Asian restaurant tucked behind a couple of gas stations is actually an awesome, authentic, family-run place ... but I didn&#39;t expect that here in Colorado, and certainly not in the endless southern suburbs.

Now, full disclosure, I haven&#39;t been to Korea and I&#39;m no expert on the food, but I ordered the San Chae Bibimbap and it came full of all sorts of yummy veggie goodness I couldn&#39;t identify. That to me is the sign of a place that isn&#39;t afraid to make a dish the way it&#39;s supposed to be, not the way they think will be least intimidating to newbies. Everything my fellow diners had in front of them looked darn yummy too.

Fortunately these guys are pretty close to my office; the next time my coworkers suggest yet another Tokyo Joe&#39;s run ... I going to make a strong pitch for this place instead."

I needed to turn around and ended up in this little shopping center. Since I had some time and needed lunch, I decided to try this place as I am always looking for good Korean food (hard to come by in south Denver).  I tried the #1 - Bibimbap - and got it with beef.  It was outstanding.  In fact, it was so good, I came back the next day even though it was a 20 minute drive.  This dish has the perfect combo of ingredients, including rice, spinach, sprouts, korean beef, and a fried egg on top.  I also got a side of kimchi, which was also very good. I am happy to have discovered this little gem."

My husband had the Galbi plate and he enjoyed the included side dishes. However, there are less side dishes compared to the usual 7-10 you would receive at most Korean restaurants but I didn&#39;t expect much since it was more of a counter service restaurant than dine-in.

I had the bulgogi bibimbap that I wished I shared with one of my sisters instead of buying two of them since it was pretty large for the price. I also wished that I ordered the stone bowl but I didn&#39;t see that option on the menu until after I payed and saw it on a sign/board standing nearby the fountain drink dispenser. My siblings ordered ramen and a bulgogi plate, which the toddlers enjoyed sharing with them. My two 2-year olds loved the bulgogi kimbap, which was pretty inexpensive for the amount received - about $4! 

It was a bit confusing whether they brought the food to you but we quickly found out once they called our orders to pick up and bring to our own tables.

Overall, if you&#39;re craving inexpensive yet tasty Korean food, Bop &amp; Gogi will sure to fill you up!"

I really wasn&#39;t expecting to find anything this good in Centennial.

Read positive reviews and love Korean food. Had a craving for the Bibimbap. Called about 11:45 a.m. to order pickup since I was limited on time. Line rang and rang - no answer. Called again and line rang and then went to fax line. Tried again and same result. 

Already driving so continued to restaurant hoping they were just experiencing technical difficulties. Arrived to find the door locked and a sign saying they decided to close for July 1 (long weekend). I guess I won&#39;t be trying this place after all.

The korean taco along with the bibimbap was extremely filling. You would either be stuffed or having to take leftovers home.

The wait for the food was a little longer than i thought (maybe 10-15 minutes because there seemed to of been one person making the food); although i didn&#39;t mind at all.

The reason I give it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because I wasnt served with traditional banchan (side dishes) like in other traditional korean restaurants.

I would highly recommend this place compared to the other korean places (seoul bbq and sushi) for bibimbap because the price is way more reasonable as well as it tasting better."

The actual UYE is at 11:30hrs but I arrived at this establishment about 11:45hrs ish.  Thankfully I managed to get a ride and meeting fellow Yelpers that Friday.  The rest of the Yelpers are already there, enjoying their Lunch.  Yes, you order at the counter.  The lovely staff will send your order to your table.  I could NOT really recall what are the rest of the sides dishes that they offer that afternoon.  The items that I could vaguely recall were kimchi, cucumber kimchi and Pancake to name a few.  

Err, NOTE TO SELF, next time please pay attention to tiny details.  *SIGH*

Unfortunately, they NO longer offer the Beef Galbi, which I was hoping for coz of their Supplier DO NOT offer the right cuts of meats for them.  *Sad Face*

Hence my second choice was the SPICY Squid Plate ($9.95), with tax is ($10.57)  THANK GOD, they have it.  I opt to have 2 sides of Egg Mini Pancake, and Kimchi, with Fried Rice.  Do my order WOW me?  NOT As Much.  The SPICY Squid, has a kick, but NOT the SPICY Kick I was hoping for.  YES, there are a couple of Jalapenos, and Serrano Chilies in the SPICY Squid.  I wish the portion of the SPICY Squid could be more BUT it was NOT.

The Kimchi was &#34;MEH&#34; aka Bland.  NOT SPICY AT ALL.  * Another SAD FACE*  It DOES NOT have the Kimchi Bite I am used to, lack of something which I cannot figure out.  The Mini Egg Pancake was &#34;MEH&#34; too, though a sprinkle of salt and pepper can make the differences.

The Lunch pricing it was just A-Okay though I feel it was a little higher than other Korean establishments that I am used to.  Maybe next time I might order something different though it might be unlikely.  Perhaps the different choices of side dishes can also MAKE OR BREAK, the dining option here.  All in all Decent Lunch and hence this 3 star review for this visit.

It would be nice if they can offer MORE Variety of AUTHENTIC KOREAN items such as Gimbap and Tteokbokki in their Menu or switch their menu to entice more patrons with adventurous palate such as me!  *Wink Wink* 

Nevertheless, I do hope they can maintain their service and I wish them MANY MORE Success in their future business undertakings and definitely there is room for improvement.  The establishment is kept very clean and the staffs are indeed friendly and inviting.  The lady who handled my transaction that afternoon her name is Jaymie.

There was the perfect amount of sauce, chicken, rice, and crisp veggies. Every bite was perfect. No plain rice bites here!
I did order mild chicken, but it was a bit spicy. I loved it, just spicier than expected. I&#39;ll chock it up to my ignorance of Korean cuisine.

It was a bit after 1pm, and we were pretty much the only customers.  I ordered the Bibimbop (served with ground beef, sunny side up egg and 5-kinds of vegetables) for $8.95.  This Bowl (which means served with 1 scoop of rice with mixed vegetables) came with a side of miso soup.  I asked if they could substitute Kimchi instead, and they were kind enough to agree.  The Kimchi was pretty tasty, both in flavor and texture.  After seeing how fast I devoured it, the lady was kind enough to bring me some more.

The Bibimbop was good bordering on very good.  It was a generous portion and it was prepared quickly.  Indeed, I was rather impressed with how well they put this together considering the fast-casual business model.  The sesame oil flavor was about right.

I ordered the Chicken Bowl and the lady behind the counter automatically ordered me the large portion without asking if I wanted the small. I realized it and told her I only wanted the small. When the food came out it was swimming in teriyaki sauce. The chicken was very tender, but there was just too much sauce on it. My boyfriend ordered the Galbi Burrito and a spam musubi. He wasn&#39;t a fan of the Burrito, but he said the musubi was good. Unfortunately, we won&#39;t be returning and our search for good Korean food continues."

Walked in today. Inquired about the udons and ramen. Female owner did not understand English. Male owner sitting at dining table walked over.

Owner: &#34;All noodles are from package.&#34;
Me: &#34;What brand.&#34;
Owner (proudly) &#34;Shin ramen&#34;
Me: &#34;That&#39;s the same stuff I have at home, and you charge $8?&#34;

Me: &#34;Did I just hear a cough in the kitchen? Someone is sick.&#34;

Me: &#34;Not if she&#39;s cooking my food. (Male owner continued to give me the death stare) Dude, seriously?&#34;

Yes, it would have been better for the spicy pork to have been freshly cooked, but it just isn&#39;t that type of place.  They fried the egg fresh to to the bowl with though! 

The rice was great quality rice, straight out of the rice cooker.  Way better than the rice you&#39;d get at a place like Tokyo Joe&#39;s.

I used to frequent this small Korean place for lunch.   I would get the spicy pork bowl.   The food was stir fried to order and always delicious.   

Unfortunately I just ate here last week,  (after they reopened)  and was severely disappointed with the food.   Instead of cooking the food for us the new man preparing the food just assembled our bowls from pre cooked veggies and meat in a minute or two.   Although the food isn&#39;t what I would consider bad,  it definitely was not nearly as good as they used to make it.   The veggies were soggie and it just didn&#39;t have the same fresh taste as the previous version. 

I never minded waiting the five or ten minutes for them to cook the food and then bring it out to us because it was always so tasty. 

I probably will not be coming here anymore because of this.   I now think that this precooked food is no longer worth the $9 per bowl.   

I love supporting little mom and pop restaurants like this but not when you prepare food like Panda Express. 

Let me know when you cook to order again and I would be happy to give you my money."

This time, we decided to just sit down and see what happened, and they brought us our food with a smile!  The runner was quick to tell us to let her know if we need soy sauce or anything else.  Then no less than 3 times, we had a staff person approach our table to ask how everything was, if we needed anything more, and if they could clear our plates.  They were unobtrusive, kind and appeared to genuinely be interested in helping, etc.

Came here for late lunch with friends. I honestly don&#39;t even really know what I ordered though I think it was the bulgogi beef plate with all sorts of little scoops of salads. Everything was tasty and I cleaned my plate. 

With a drink though, I thought the meal was expensive. Cost over $12 and wasn&#39;t really a TON of food. The employees are friendly but pushy. They start putting food on your plate before you tell them what you want. HAHA! Being my first Korean food experience, I didn&#39;t know what I was choosing and I felt pressured... I just had to point to things that looked good and take my chances. Oh well, at least I was pushed with a smile.

It is nice to have a Korean place in this area and it is setup to have quick service.  They had a decent amount of seating inside, but it was almost empty while I was there.  I imagine most people don&#39;t know about it yet and I think the location is hard to notice from the main roads.

There are a couple of issues that, if resolved, would definitely bring this up to a 4 star rating.  

1. Every time I go there...something is broken.  First it was the credit card machine, then it was the soda fountain, then it was something with their computers.  BUT, they&#39;re always apologetic and try to make up for it in some way or another. 

2. I can&#39;t seem to get Korean-style hot bean paste here to save my life.  What&#39;s up with that?  No, not Sriracha.  No, not garlic-chili sauce.  No, not the Bibimbop sauce.  HOT BEAN PASTE.  It comes in a giant tub and is FREAKING DELICIOUS."

Bob and Gogi is just about everything i want to see in a Korean fast food joint.  You have all your classic Korean dishes and then you have some off the reservation Korean dishes such as spicy squid and Kim Chi chi gae or a pork kim chi stew.  Truth be told, the kim chi stew is no where near as good as my home made stuff, but since you will not be coming to my house, you could give it a try just for fun.  If you like posole then you will probably like Kim Chi stew.  
The bul go gi is nothing to write home about but for a fast food joint i give this a pass.  All in all, I liked the place and would recommend it if you like a more American friendly Korean style restaurant."

Combines spices and sweet tastes with traditional kimchi.   Korean burritos are not something you find normally in the Denver area. Strongly recommend the spicy pork burrito.

I ordered teriyaki chicken bowl and pork BBQ bowl two separate times and both dishes tasted about the same.  Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be back but I certainly wish these guys the best for the future.  Taste is about the same across the board.  Temperature is certainly cooler than normal when my dishes were served.  This place is just OK.  I would gravitate down the road a bit to find other lunch alternatives.

The concept of fast-casual Korean food is one rarely ventured. The niche and quality of food here could potentially bring this place great success. However, of the five times I&#39;ve been there, it has typically been empty.

As prices are currently, a standard bibmbop is 9 dollars. If you want to be full and order more rice, they&#39;ll charge you another 2 dollars. In comparison, fire bowl cafe is across Peoria, and provide much more food for about $8. Chipotle is around Arapahoe and Peoria, and provide a healthy and filling meal for $7. 

If the owners here lowered their price by a reasonable 20%, I could easily see their business doubling. I know I would go at least once or twice a week if so. 

But right now, despite their relatively good food, it&#39;s hard to walk away from this place without feeling a bit ripped off. They&#39;re trying to charge the price of a full service restaurant, but providing fast-casual food, service and atmosphere."

Me being picky with what I eat and how it tastes, wasn&#39;t expecting much from another korean fast food joint.  I tried the spicy pork bowl around $8, it was awesome. The meat was tender, sweet and had the right amount of spice. Me being a big guy, the bowl seemed kinda small to me. I was there during lunch hour and it seemed to get buzy during that time.

The kimchee was not sour (whew...dodged a bullet there) and the portion size was adequate. The only reason this doesn&#39;t get five stars is the rice seemed to have been sitting out a while and I really wanted more variety of banchan.

We had the beef lovers combo( I know that is the wrong name but its the number 4 combo) that had enough food for 3 kids and we even had a little left over to make 2 tacos. We hadthe California Burrito which was from heaven and will be eaten monthly. And last but not least the Mexican Ribs. They were falling off the bone moist and succulent.  The dessert followed dinner in the same grab fashion and i could not be happier.  This place would get 100 stars if they had it."

We are willing drive to somebody else&#39;s neighborhood because that&#39;s how much we enjoy this eatery named after Poncho Villa&#39;s horse.

During dinner service, you not only get unlimited zesty and delicious salsa with your complimentary chips, you also get slaw.  Mr. P is a huge fan of slaw and says this version is the best in the city.  Because it&#39;s made with vinegar and not mayonnaise, I really like it, too.

The menu is absolutely huge and you may need some time to study it thoroughly.  Just about any kind of Mexican treat you can think of is included.  I like the fact that two entire pages are devoted to seafood dishes.  Some of my favorites are camarones a la plancha, camarones rancheros, brocheta de camarones, and paella.  Obviously, I&#39;m a fan of shrimp.  We&#39;ve yet to be disappointed with anything we&#39;ve ordered.

The 7 Leguas waitresses are very sweet and patient with me when I&#39;m practicing my Spanish.  They are also terrific servers and will take great care of you.  Comer aquí por la buena comida (see, I told you I&#39;m learning!)."

The food - OH MY YUM! I&#39;m tired of tasteless beans and re-hydrated rice. Neither was on my plate. The beans were full of flavor and there were whole rice grains on the plate too.

My plate was clean and so was my partner&#39;s!

The 2 tacos el carbon marinated flank steak in a bit of olive oil, tequila, squeeze of lime, garlic, chili powder, and cumin ,comes w/ side of a spicy salsa verde sauce.

The parking is very limited and can be tricky. The restaurant was slammed the first time I went on Cinco De Mayo (luckily they have takeout).

You get chips and salsa that are very good. Some heat in the salsa but not mouth burning.

My wife and I shared the queso fundido, which appears to be a small portion but is deceiving. There is a ton of cheese and chorizo, which was flavorful but not spicy. The waitress was kind enough to bring us flour tortillas to put it in. Very considerate.

For my entree I tried one of the combos. It was good but not mind blowing. The previous time I had the tacos al pastor which came four to an order and had great flavor. The combo came with a shredded chicken hard taco, beef enchilada, bean burito and 

My wife had the cheese enchiladas with green sauce. She really likes them as they have a lot of flavor. The green sauce is very spicy so a side of sour cream helps to temper the heat.

You do get a lot of food and both my wife and I had leftovers. 

Definitely good and want to try more options the next time we go."

I had a burrito with just carne asada, rice and cheese on the inside, which seemed to confuse our server. But that&#39;s ok. It was topped with green chile and was super tasty.

I live down the street, so 7 Leguas is always my go to when I want Mexican food or am feeling lazy. I come here once a week usually. The staff is generally super friendly and service is quick. After reading some of the other reviews, I think people need to give 7 Leguas another chance (maybe try some of the dishes I list below- they don&#39;t disappoint). Anyways, these are my favorite things about the restaurant:
-Tortilla Soup: soo delicious, really good when you&#39;re hungover too. It&#39;s a light broth probably made from chicken stock with chicken, tortillas, rice, onions, peppers, cheese, and FRESH avocados tossed in. This is my most ordered dish.
-Molcajete: I have only found molcajetes at ONE other place in CO and 7 Leguas does the molcajete in a far superior fashion. Think a big, steaming bowl made from volcanic rock with meat, cheese, peppers, and vegetables in a steaming broth. Amazing. If you haven&#39;t ever had a molcajete in your life, it is a must!
-Breakfast burritos: I order one of these almost every other weekend. The small breakfast burritos are a whopping (sarcastic) cost of $2.75 for bacon and $3.50 for chorizo-- and they are BIG for being the small breakfast burrito. They&#39;re way bigger than the typical ones you may see at other places and are quite tasty. 
-Queso: not the queso fundido, but the regular queso. It&#39;s super good and the perfect consistency, while it also has a kick to it.
-Anything carne asada: whether it be a burrito, enchiladas, tacos, etc. the carne asada is great!!

Happy hour is good too- 2 for 1 Margs from 3-7.

Only thing that could be improved upon are the chips!

I Love Leguas"

The enchiladas were lightly bathed in red sauce and cheese. Not drowning like you find at most places. Even the refried beans and rice were good and appeared to be made from scratch.

Our waitress was super friendly and nice. The food is pretty good. (I honestly was a little scared to eat at a restaurant on Colfax).

The only reason this place doesn&#39;t get 5 stars is because their parking is fairly difficult to navigate and there&#39;s isn&#39;t much lot space."

The waitstaff was more than friendly and helpful. We had chips and salsa in the minute we sat down. 
We ordered drinks and got the great Mexican coke in a bottle. I love that stuff. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito and was amazed how big and flavorful it was. I ordered beef tacos with a side of guacamole. It was fairly good. 
Overall we had a good experience, good food and drinks for an amazing price."

There are so many great Mexican options in Colorado I&#39;m not sure why anybody would eat here unless they lived within a two block radius.
The tacos were pretty good but the tostadas very disappointing in the burrito was very average. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to make a decent ships but they would&#39;ve been better served to buy them out of a bag.
The prices weren&#39;t great, but the service was OK, the people are pretty friendly, and it was somewhat kid friendly. Normally authenticity is a desirable place in the Mexican restaurant, but unfortunately managed to capture the weather too. It was hot as hell in that restaurant, and that&#39;s saying a lot since I live in South Carolina. If you really must eat Mexican food, there are so many other options however if you&#39;re drunk and don&#39;t want to drive anywhere then I guess this place would suffice."

This place isn&#39;t as popular as some of the better known Mexican joints in town, but I&#39;d say it is a much better value and you never have to wait to be seated.

That is really all I need to share about 7 Leguas. They have a California burrito which truthfully is the only thing I miss about Mexican food in California.

Haven&#39;t had this beautiful concoction yet? Well, my friends it&#39;s a burrito with carne asada and French fries alongside a bunch of cheese and guacamole inside it. It is so fantastically good and bad for you.

The tacos are also good. I hear they have karaoke on some nights. And the bar is the kind of place that Sir Nicholas enjoys drinking beer. But, the 5 stars are all for the California burrito. I can barely contain my excitement that I&#39;ve finally found one in Denver."

The carnitas are wonderful--crispy and fatty along with tender, just so you know--and the ingredients all seem house made (I didn&#39;t ask, though). 

Portion sizes are quite large, so that plate of four tacos is actually enough for two people if you order any other food. Or, if you like to eat a lot of tacos, it should satisfy. 

Tip: you can get tacos à la carte for not much more, so take advantage of that if you&#39;re solo and not ravenous. 

Happy hour margaritas are two-for-one."

To start, the restaurant is your typical Colfax joint - while not much to look at on the outside, the inside is very cute and clean. The staff were incredibly friendly and took very good care of our table. 

We started with their chips and guac and for $8 - you get a lot! Most places tend to scrimp when it comes to guac but they certainly did not and there was 4 of us and we still did not eat it all. Their house salsa is also very good.

For lunch, I had the California burrito - carne asada, guac, sour cream, cheese, and FRENCH FRIES!!!! Yep, that&#39;s what sold me - not even gonna lie and it did not disappoint!!! I know what you&#39;re thinking - didn&#39;t the fries get soggy? Actually, no, not until several bites in when they were kind of covered in guac but even then, still really good. The burrito was quite large and I only ate half but I did also get a side of rice because, well, I love rice. It was good - just your standard rice.

My co-workers had flautas, enchiladas, and a chicken burrito. Some managed to eat all and some did not - just depends on your appetite I supose :) but NONE of us left unsatisifed. Everything was just delicious and their menu is huge!!! 

I have also had their fajitas (at the party my friend had catered) and they were incredibly good and would definitely be my second choice there but that California burrito may have won me over. I mean, it has french fries in it!!!! Enough said.

I definitely recommend this spot if your on this side of town and I look forward to heading back soon!"

This was a bit off the beaten path, but no further than most of Colfax.  This stretch of Colfax has ample parking.  The service was both friendly and good.  This place is of reasonable size, and we had no trouble getting a couple tables at noon on a Wednesday.  The customers were a demographic mix (from Park Hill and further out), which can often be a good way of judging how universally popular a place is.   Basically, this is a full-blown Mexican restaurant, with a full bar, that serves everything from basic tacos, to large combo platters, to much more elaborate dishes including seafood.  They do all this while keeping the prices reasonable.

I was early, so I started with a rather large, and quite refreshing, Michelada.  This is a Mexican &#34;cerveza preparada&#34; made with beer, lime juice, assorted sauces, and spices.  It is then served over ice in a chilled, salt-rimmed glass.  In this case, it came in a large beer mug and definitely hit the spot.  For my lunch, I opted for the 4 taco plate.  You can do &#34;2 &amp; 2&#34;, so I went with the carnitas and the al carbon.  They were quite good.  The meat had been well-rendered, to the verge of crispy, without becoming overly dry.  Along with the double tortillas, cilantro, and onion, they served a rather potent green sauce that complimented all the flavors.

The manager (owner?) sent over a dessert platter of deep fried ice cream surrounded by sopapillas. This was drizzed with chocolate and whipped cream, with honey on the side.  This was a great, sweet ending to a very filling and flavorful meal.  I would gladly come back here again."

My husband got the Burrito de Fajita with the jalapeño/sour cream sauce on the side and he really liked it. The only complaint I have is that we sat in the back of the restaurant, next to their coke machine, and it was so loud we couldn&#39;t have a conversation."

I ordered the 7 Leguas Combination based on the picture in the menu.  I still don&#39;t know exactly which number that corresponds to on the menu, but it doesn&#39;t matter. It had a crispy, smothered relleno, a smothered beef tamale and two tostadas - one covered in beans and the other in a /massive/ heap of guacamole.

 

I am not only a self-proclaimed guac snob - other people have begun to take notice. I&#39;m just picky, that&#39;s all.  And, the guac on this tostada was DIVINE.  Delicately, yet effectively, seasoned but still allowing the sweet avocado to come to the forefront of any onion or cilantro. And, folks, if you haven&#39;t picked up on it, they aren&#39;t stingy.

 

The menu is just extensive enough to ensure that I will have to be back more than once, just to get a better taste of the rest of what they offer.  The place was empty when we left, and it should have been slammed.  

 

Check this place out."

I have read the word authentic to describe the dishes and I agree but I want to describe it a bit differently with an example. Both of my grandmothers were authentic Southern cooks; however, my Dad&#39;s mom was an exceptional cook. I think of 7 Leguas Grill as being in the same category as my Dad&#39;s mom, exceptional.

The husband ordered the arroz con pollo and gave it a major thumbs up. I had cheese enchiladas with their green chili and loved every bite. I do want to gush about the beans, I know they are just a small side dish but these refritos were supurb in their seasoning and texture. 

Happy Hour is 3 -7 which means most of the time cocktails with dinner will be cheap. And Bernardo and his wife, the owners, are so nice and friendly. I hope this little place stays in the neighborhood as it really will become a regular.

And that is the review. My last comment is that the star count is exact and I promise I did not give an extra star because of the name. 7 Leguas was Poncho Villa&#39;s horse and the inside of 7 Leguas Grill is decorated with both of their pictures."

I decided to bring my sister, who has just move back to Denver after a 20 year hiatus, to 7 Leguas. I was so excited because the last three times I visited this restaurant it was phenomenal food and fabulous service. This time I&#39;m so sad to say, was not a good visit. Upon pulling up to the business we noticed the side parking lot almost completely blocked off by an employee&#39;s car. This is the second time that it&#39;s happened. It&#39;s aggravating for someone like me who has a hard time walking without my oxygen. But okay the food is worth it so we&#39;ll go in.  We are greeted right away and brought drinks and chips and salsa and I ordered guacamole. The guacamole was horrible and tasted like they added sour cream or mayonnaise to it and I&#39;m allergic to both. I specifically asked the owner if it had mayonnaise or sour cream and he promised me it had neither. My allergic reaction later on in the evening says otherwise so... 
I ordered a combo with my favorite chicken enchiladas. But this time the flavor just wasn&#39;t there. It made my whole dish bland, including the beans and rice. Maggie had a giant burrito: she was happy with it for the most part but again, her beans and rice were bland. She also ended up with stomach issues. 
Our server was great which is why she&#39;s getting all the stars, the food doesn&#39;t get any stars. A huge disappointment. 
This review is getting long but suffice it to say, our meal was less than average, there were flies everywhere, no paper towels in the bathroom, and I ended up with a night full of bellyaches and two days worth of body pain due to either sour cream or mayonnaise or something of that nature being in the guacamole. After this happened I went and checked their inspection reports and they don&#39;t do well on surprise inspections which distressed me even more. I&#39;m waiting to see what the end of the year surprise inspections show but I probably won&#39;t be back again. This makes me sad. So so sad."

Some of the best mexican I&#39;ve had north of the border.  Do not skip this place if you&#39;re in town."

We were served with water, chips and salsa. The chips could have used a lot more salt. My girlfriend and I ordered guacamole as an appetizer, menudo and the red chicken enchiladas as our entrees. 

When we received our guacamole, it was odd that we received more chips. So we had 2 baskets of chips, which would have been nice if they had more salt lol. The entrees came out quickly and the size was great! (I love pigging out) everything was very tasty, but could have used a bit more seasonings. 

Overall, our experience was great! Will be returning!"

I would have at least died happy though. My tacos de 7 Leguas Alambre of al pastor and asada were loaded heavily. It took me a second to find the tortillas under the pile of filling/topping! Nicely spiced and perfectly cooked they were very tasty. I guess the only thing I might have a complaint about is the lack of salsa choices or the lack of an adequate amount of salsa. The little1/2 full plastic to go cup of their salsa verde was tasty but I could easily have used two per taco instead of the one I got with my plate (and the two extra the waitress brought me when I asked for more.). We did score a complimentary dessert plate that looked amazing but I think that would have guaranteed me an ambulance trip if added to my already overstuffed belly. Next time I&#39;ll have to split an order or have half packaged to go.  How did it take me so long to come here?

This was one of the cleaner Mexican restaurants we&#39;ve visited. 7 Leguas has a nice menu and very friendly staff.

During our first visit there were only 2 waitresses and a packed house. They did an exceptional job. Service was a little slow but for the situation it was exceptional. 

On our 2nd visit, which was a slower evening our server was great. We enjoyed our meal and left happy. However I left my credit card there and didn&#39;t realize it until the next morning. I stopped by after work and they had it secured and waiting for me. 

This local establishment provides good food, reasonable prices and exceptional service. We look forward to becoming regulars. I would highly recommend giving place a shot and you won&#39;t be disappointed."

My husband and I moved to Denver about 5 months ago and have been on the hunt for the best Mexican in the Park Hill/City Park area of Denver (e.g. close to our house).  After going to an almost &#34;too authentic&#34; place, followed by the most inauthentic Mexican restaurant on the planet, I think we have finally found the &#34;go to&#34; Mexican we&#39;ve been craving.

I couldn&#39;t choose between the chorizo and lenguas (beef tongue) tacos, so the super-friendly waitress suggested I get two of each (there are 4 in an order).  Thanks for the suggestion and for being super accomodating!  My husband got the chicken and beef fajitas - delicious!  Also a plus that the beans and rice are really good too (not just sub-par filler items that you can run into elsewhere).

It&#39;s clear that everything is made from scratch and that the employees really care about you.  When we walked in, only one other table was occupied (which is sometimes a red flag, but we attributed that to a chilly Monday evening), but the staff greeted us immediately and made us feel right at home.

Best of all - with complimentary chips and (spicy, delicious, homemade) sala, a big plate of fajitas (with free tortilla refills), a huge plate of tacos, one beer and one soda - the bill came to only $30 (INCLUDING tip).

We&#39;re going back.  Not sure I&#39;m up for music/kareoke (from other reviews), so this might be our weeknight haunt."

We gave this restaurant two chances as we were really looking for a good Mexican restaurant in the area.  First time we got take out and it was decent.  So we decided to go to the restaurant last week to eat.  Big Mistake.
Service: Hopefully we just caught our waitress on a bad day, but she wasn&#39;t very friendly.  Anytime I asked for something I felt like I was putting her out.  Even once when she made a mistake on my drink! 
Food: I got the Veggie Enchiladas and my husband got the Veggie Burrito.  Both were okay as we ate them, I think the sour cream and jalapeño sauce masked a lot of the taste.  We were hungry so we ate a lot of it, but I wasn&#39;t in love with it.  But then problems ensued.  Both myself and my husband had horrible stomach aches later that night.  My sickness has progressed and it&#39;s now been a full week.  It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m pregnant.

I repeat, they have happy hour, and I thoroughly enjoy a good happy hour! And you can enjoy happy hour right at your table (instead of in the bar area, like most restaurants).

My most recent experience here was during the 2015 holiday season. This was the best experience I&#39;ve ever had at this Carrabba&#39;s. From the service to the food to the ambiance, I have no complaints.

The service: I really wish I could remember our server&#39;s name because she was fantastic! Friendly, outgoing and on point the entire visit (so much so that we left her a 30 percent tip)!

The food: Carrabba&#39;s serves warm, delicious bread with these herbs and olive oil. We always ask for more herbs because they are quite pleasing on the tongue. Remember that fantastic service? Our server added the extra herbs and it was perfect! She also recommended a few items that we tried: the scallops with spinach and wood-fired Italian wings. Those wings were saying something and when I server discovered that the scallops were on the small side, she had the kitchen make more.

The drinks: It was happy hour remember? That means drink specials! Anytime I have a drink when I&#39;m dining out, I&#39;m always worried it will lack alcohol; not at Carrabba&#39;s! The bartender mixed the pomegranate martini perfectly.

Overall, I usually always enjoy my meal at Carrabba&#39;s. I love the food (especially the bread and herbs)."

Let me start by saying the our waiter was fantastic and no issues there. Our issue resides with the mediocre menu, small servings, but with bigger prices. 

We started with the calamari. It was so-so, mainly lightly breaded (good), peppered (meh), with a good side of marina sauce. 6/10.

My wife ordered two portions of ravioli with Alfredo sauce. She was given 10 small ravioli&#39;s and charged $14. To put that into perspective, my meal had linguine with seafood (shrimp/scallops) and cost $2 more. 3/10

My meal, the linguine with shrimp/scallops came in a shallow bowl, presented nicely. After eating the 4 nickel size shrimp and 5-6 pinky nail size scallops, the plate had nothing left to keep me interested. 

I regret spending the amount of money I did here, and will not be coming back again. There are plenty of accurately priced restaurants in the area to receive our business. It&#39;s a shame, 3-5years ago this was a great place with great portions to match the prices."

Once we arrived, I immediately enjoyed the low lighting, warm, homely feel that this dinery had. The server was attentive, funny, and had some outstanding recommendations! And the food was terrific. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and all I have to say is... SPLENDID. The lobster was succulent, the cheese was deliciously melted, and the ravioli was cooked to perfection.

My dish was tiny for paying 22.50. Other wise it was overall mediocre with the medallion cut into 3 small portion, with mash potatoes and green beans. Needless to say my dish was better than my friends pesto because mine had to be made fresh. Her pesto was salty and we were aproached by a very nice chef who asked about our feedback. We told him about how salty the pesto was. He proceeded to let us know that the pesto was not made in house but in Florida but using thier recipe. And that there other sauce are also made in Florida. I asked about it not being made in house as I was shocked to find that it wasn&#39;t made on location! He said it was for consistency. After that I was done with hear excuses and left it at that. For such a high priced resturant I felt ripped of because of the small portion and the lack of interest that goes into making thier own recipes. I would recommend going some where else as I do see brio going out of business in the next year or so if they don&#39;t change something, as it was dead on a Friday night.

First, the hostess seated two larger groups that arrived after we had. So I questioned her about the seating priority, she replied our was being setup. Twenty minutes later our mom asked about our table as several other groups had been seated, the time now was 1:30. Being seated took another 10 minutes in a booth with added chairs that protruded into the isle! Although we requested table we hesitantly took it to avoid further delay. The server took another 10 minutes to bring menus and drinks, which she got wrong. The place was under staffed and were poorly trained. The manager finally came to see if we were satisfied, so we began telling her of the delayed seating time and slow service. Her response was to turn her back as she started with some insincere apology. That was the last we saw her as we got up to leave, insulted she wouldn&#39;t talk to us face to face. 
We will not return here and not recommend them to anyone.


 We went to a nearby restaurant where we were seated immediately, served promptly and left satisfied, happy to pay $300(including tip) for a great meal, drinks to celebrate and fantastic service."

My minestrone soup tasted like it had been sitting out for a long time. It tasted like leftovers. Our salads were fresh but the onions were in MASSIVE slices. Our server was friendly, which warrants two stars because she was attentive, but our meals were plain too. Chicken Marsala was flavorless and my spicy seafood dish (I forgot the name) the shrimp were overcooked and it wasn&#39;t spicy. For what we paid, we get a lot more food and better quality at Maggiano&#39;s instead of carrabba&#39;s."

I like Carrabba&#39;s- been here many times over the years and always get fast friendly service (sometimes too fast when they bring the main course out before the apps-but only happens once in a while) there is rarely a long wait to be seated. Good happy hour prices! The Filet Fiorentina is probably one of the best steaks I have ever had- melts like butter once it hits your mouth-great flavor as well. The wine selection is ok, but they do carry a great Pinot Grigio-Bisanzio! I think everything here is just A-OK, but the steak would get five stars alone!"

The menu was fairly small, but usually is a good sign. The menu had vague descriptions of Italian titles leaving the average non Italian speaking person clueless unless they have happen to have had that dish. However, I saw fried raviolis and it was different and new, so I had my heart set on those. 
We got to the table and I had to have the waitress explain some of the things l had no idea about to see if it was a place I might want to come back to, nothing popped out. The waitress was vary nice and you could tell she was experienced and enjoyed her job. We ordered our drinks and then ordered after we got our drinks. She came back and informed me they are out of fried ravioli. Since that was the olny thing I cared to eat and really wanted to try, it was a big let down. I decided to order the chicken sampler dish that had 3 of their different styles of chicken for $25. I figure my chances of getting something good were better. The soup and bread were good, but I started getting full, which im sure they plan for that. 
We got our food, the chicken was cooked normal and proportions were on the small side.. however the 3 different dishes were the same dish with a slightly different sauce. They weren&#39;t anything special or memorable. Leaving me to think their menu is even smaller really. 
I did leave full from the combination of bread, soup, and a little chicken. A $60 bill for 2, leaves me to think the best part of the meal for the money was having a waitress with a great attitude.
I will not be going back though."

In other words I refuse to eat at Olive Garden.  Carrabba&#39;s is delish IF you order the right dish.  I will be the first to admit I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the pasta dishes I have tried here ( Maggiano&#39;s pasta is superior).  That being said they have really good food otherwise.  

This is the only restaurant I order chicken dishes at because I figure I can make chicken better at home except for Carrabba&#39;s.  Their Chicken Bryan &amp; Chicken Marsala are hands down my favorites here.  The Minestrone soup is fantastic.  The Caesar salad is so good (you can tell they use real anchovy in the dressing) and the salad plates are always chilled which I love.

I also am a fan of a few of their cocktails I have tried.  The Peach Sangria and the Pomegranate Martini are very tasty.  I came here during their Happy Hour one time and it was buy one, get one with their cocktails.  Of course I can&#39;t recall the time Happy Hour is at.  

I&#39;ve read other reviews on here of people not getting the greatest service but I&#39;ve never had a problem with the service.  All of the servers have been great (sometimes even a little over the top friendly).  Give it a try."

You could have a nice dinner here if it&#39;s not sports night or even a group of friends for something more casual! This place is great for any occasion :) Personally on this visit, we had a nice romantic dinner. Although we called ahead and asked for a more &#34;private&#34; table, when we arrived there was absolutely no record of our call. However, the Broncos game had just ended and the place was pretty empty save for a few families having dinner. I still would&#39;ve liked to get a nicer table though. The happy hour special was nice as it extended to include mixed wine drinks and seasonal specials as well. I wish the prices had been explained better as I could&#39;ve SWORN the server assured me that happy hour reduced the price of my wine glass from &#34;7 to about 5 or 6.&#34; Surprise! When we got the bill, both of the drinks we had ordered were full price and even my &#34;small&#34; appetizer was up charged $2 because I ate an appetizer as my entree instead of an actual entree. I really hate when restaurants charge for every little thing. Especially without putting a disclaimer . Despite that, The food was delicious and the wine was wonderful.

We had calamari for our antipasto which was really good. The small portion was more than enough for 2. We ended up taking some home. 

I had the Pasta Weesie (Shrimp sauteed in a garlic, lemon butter, white wine sauce with sauteed mushrooms and scallions, served over fettuccine alfredo) was good. The shrimp was FRESH!!! The waitress, Marie, suggested I have it with the Newman&#39;s Own white wine and it matched well.

Then I had the panna cotta for dessert and that was awesome. 

I tasted my friend&#39;s minestrone and it wasn&#39;t red! It was the first minestrone soup I had that was REALLY good.

I think the best part of dinner was the calamari and bread. The calamari was so lightly battered, and crispy. I loved that it had black pepper and the marinara sauce was also a little spiced up, so it didn&#39;t feel too greasy/heavy.  The bread was served with olive oil, basil, sea salt and pepper. The bread was warm and I loved the olive oil mixture.

Other than that, the entrees were only okay.  We got the Chicken Trio - Chicken Bryan, Chicken Marsala and Rosa Maria. I thought the Chicken Bryan was TOO much. There was a huge chunk of goat cheese on it and all you tasted was the goat cheese. The Rosa Maria was too salty for me. But the Chicken Marsala was really good! So was the side of spinach.. it came with the garlic perfectly cooked - just the way I like it. We also got the chicken fettucine alfredo (one of the Founder&#39;s Pastas), which was also average.

Carrabba&#39;s Italian Grill
2088  S Abilene St.
Aurora, CO 80014

On February 28th, after a long work week my husband and I decided to use a gift card we had received recently as a wedding gift.  We were both exhausted and looking forward to a pleasant meal at your restaurant.  Our son came with us to spend an enjoyable evening together.

After placing our drink orders, our waiter, Brian, brought a full tray to our table which included our drinks and a full glass of beer for another customer.  While he was placing our drinks on our table, he lost control of the tray and the glass of beer came tumbling down, and I was drenched with ice cold beer.

We began to mop up the beer with napkins and waited for someone to come to help because the napkins weren&#39;t absorbing the liquid.  Becky arrived at the table with more napkins and tried to mop up the spill.  I suggested that they get a towel and she sent Brian to get one.  In the meantime, I continued to help wipe up the beer which was on the table, the booth seat and all over my lap.

We didn&#39;t raise a fuss and accepted Brian and Becky&#39;s apologies and even laughed when Becky said &#34;At least we know our beer is cold&#34;.

Needless to say, our evening was ruined and I sat eating my meal with cold, wet pants.  When our bill arrived, we fully expected to see some kind of compensation in the way of a discount, free drinks or something!  My son, who has been the manager of several Denver restaurants was appalled that not one courtesy was extended to us by your restaurant.

Please know that it not money that is important to us.  We fully expected to pay for our meals when we chose to come to your restaurant, however the lack of good public relations on the part of your establishment left us with extremely poor impressions of Carrabba&#39;s.  My son urged me to write this letter because he feels you should know what took place.

This information was sent to the General Manager of the restaurant about three weeks ago and we have not yet received a response."

We visited several Italian restaurants and chose Carraba&#39;s Italian Grill  because they were all about what WE preferred and not their standard service format. Our party of 20 was placed very close to the front of the restaurant which made it very convenient for our arriving guests. The service started with great appetizers and quickly served cocktails. The two servers were very gracious and accommodating. After an ample time of snacking and visiting we were seated and dinner began. Soups and salads were brought out and the Caesar salad I had was fresh and tasty. Everyone loved the different soups as well.  We all ordered a variety of entrees like chicken Marsala, meat kabobs and a variety of pasta dishes. All were perfectly prepared and delivered in perfect unison. We brought our own cake and they brought it out with candles lit and singing. The servers were so nice to fully engage with us including the dessert as well as offering coffees of all types. The bill was very reasonable for 20 people, the service spectacular and I will host another  event at Carraba&#39;s Italian Grill again."

The service here is some of the worst I&#39;ve ever had.  3 parties were seated after us and were waited on before we were ever approached by a server, and that was after we waved him down.  We&#39;ve had similar experiences with our other visits here as well. My wife talked to the manager, she basically gave her lip service.

The food. So so.  Ordered veal picatta, no capers in the sauce ?  My wife had to ask for a side of capers.  My side of the house pasta, luke warm.

We will never patronize this particular Carrabba&#39;s again.  Looks like we will have to drive all the way to Colorado Springs to experience decent food and service."

Didn&#39;t feel like steak so I was glad we went with the Italian choice even though Carrabba&#39;s is apparently a chain restaurant.  Too bad Yelp doesn&#39;t have half stars because I&#39;d say Carrabba&#39;s is a solid 3.5.

I got the chicken Santa Maria (waiter&#39;s recommended chicken entree) and it was very well cooked with olive oil and some cheese in between the chicken breasts sliced in half width wise.  It was quite oily but in a good way with a side of spinach.  We also grabbed a calamari/fried mozzarella as the appetizer and after everything was said and done, we were looking at $30/person.  

Considering that we got there only 10 minutes before they officially closed and that we stayed for almost an hour after they officially closed, we were very happy they were servicing our needs."

Carrabba&#39;s Caesar is just vinegary enough and has just a hint of anchovy.  It also features good crutons and a nice amount of Parmesan cheese.  Yum!

Other than that, everything we have tried has been very good.  The service is good and we always enjoy it when we go to dinner at Carrabba&#39;s.  

Oh, and the white wine sangria is very good, with bright citrus flavor."

Had some reservations about a &#34;chain&#34; restaurant and I was very surprised. First of all the staff could not have been more friendly, helpful and genuinely  service oriented, from the hostess to the server to the bus person. The menu had a good variety of offerings with moderate prices. My son and I both ordered house salads and an entree. We also received all the warm bread we could eat and my Diet Coke got refilled as soon as I had downed half of what was in the glass.  Portions were enough to fill you up nicely and the food was tasty, well seasoned and the pasta in both dishes was done correctly, not soggy at all. Check for two salads, two entrees, soft drinks came to $38.00, not bad.

Not your true Italian dining experience but good enough that I will return. I can do without the fancy tables, dinner ware, singers and often times arrogant staff."

I have eaten at multiple Carrabba&#39;s across the US hundreds of times, in fact while my wife worked that the location in Woodbridge, VA in 2000, I ate there on average 4-5 times a week for about a year.  Yes, this played hell on my waistline.  We have always received outstanding service at the location in Aurora.

This is a restaurant that always delivers fresh, top quality, and truly great food.  I have yet to find better Mussels in the Denver area, their steaks are fantastic as are their pasta dishes.  With that said, I am of the opinion that if you are one of those who actually go out to eat Spaghetti then you are wasting your time, money, and are taking up a seat I could be sitting in.  

The specials at Carrabba&#39;s are that... special.  These are non-menu items that typically have a short run and have never disappointed.  Whether it was braised Italian beef pot roast, lamb shank, or their Italian gnocchi.

Their desserts, are all equally delicious.  I would recommend any one of them."

5 stars might seem a bit extreme for a chain restaurant.  I have worked at Carrabba&#39;s as a teenager and eaten at locations throughout Colorado, Virginia, Maryland.
THIS location is by far the best I have ever dealt with.  I do like Carrabba&#39;s food- I lived in Italy for 5 years and it is nice to eat americanized-italian food that isn&#39;t all cheese and red sauces.  Made from scratch alfredo (not that horrible stuff the get in vats at O.G.- I know, I worked there as a teen too) brick-oven pizza, &amp; great chicken dishes set Carrabba&#39;s apart from other italian joints.
But what sets this location apart is the consistency and service.  
I have utilized the Aurora Carrabba&#39;s for many work functions- I am a school secretary and they always come through with a delicious meal, that is reasonably priced.   Whether busy or slow, food is always great when dining in.
And they go above and beyond.  I had tickets to see a play downtown, and was meeting family first for dinner.  Weather was kind of cruddy, and one of our party ran really late, cutting our time to dine to practically nothing.  I called ahead and preordered our dinner to eat IN, we walked in and a hot plate of awesome Chicken Bryan with a caesar salad, bread and drink was waiting for me, my mom and my sister&#39;s Chicken Pizza came out as we were taking off our coats.  Manager was completely accommodating, bartender who was waiting on our table was super quick, and we got out in no time. 
Kudos to  a well run location!"

While the chicken was grilled nicely, and my boyfriend liked the fontina on top of his, the side dishes were not spectacular overall though I did like the garlic in the zucchini.  Our desserts were tiny and oddly just given to us from the spread that our waiter was describing--that made us question whether we were getting food that had been sitting out a while.  

The menus, regular and the summer grill fixe, were somewhat difficult to understand.  It didn&#39;t actually seem to matter to our waiter what menu we were using.  My boyfriend and I ended up with three side dishes, two salads, and two desserts between us even though we thought we were ordering from the regular menu which had more side dish choices to go with our main entrees.

In any case, while we enjoyed ourselves, the whole dinner was way more costly than what we expected to pay.  We had been thinking more along the lines of Olive Garden or Applebee&#39;s pricing.  Over $16 for most chicken dishes seemed steep.  We&#39;ll probably stick with non-chain restaurants that are less expensive, too, in the future."

They were crazy busy, and couldn&#39;t get waited on (couldn&#39;t even get water) for quite awhile. Finally, things calmed down and our service was A-OK. 

The lentil soup was tasty, though since it contained quite a bit of Italian sausage, it was fairly salty. My spaghetti was sauced perfectly --- not at all drippy, just lightly tossed in tomato sauce."

I used to work there as a server for about a year and a half so I have first hand experience. The most important thing you should know about the food is that it is all made from scratch, from fresh ingredients delivered daily. The soup, salad dressings, every pasta sauce, breadcrumbs, the herb mix you use for the bread....all from scratch. The calamari, fried zucchini and mozzarella are breaded to order. This is why their prices are higher than other chains. Nothing on your plate was frozen, pre-made or processed. In my opinion, fresh homemade food is about as good as it gets."

This was my first time in a Carrabba&#39;s Italian Grill and I wasn&#39;t too impressed. I realize that some things on an Italian restaurant&#39;s menu aren&#39;t always made the same way. Chicken Cacciatore for and example, I&#39;ve always known it to have chicken, green peppers, mushrooms and onions sauteed in a Marinara and served over rice or maybe pasta . At Carrabba&#39;s the chicken is served with red peppers and onions over polenta. I&#39;m not going to even try it. I think the green peppers and mushrooms make the dish myself. Aaron was understanding and offered to have mushrooms added to the Chicken Cacciatore when I mentioned the lack of mushrooms when we were ordering but I declined and ordered the Veal Picatta instead. My wife and I shared an order of Calamari and as my wife stated in her review, it came out fast. I think they could have cooked it a little longer, it wasn&#39;t quite golden yet. I liked my Italian salad, it was the best part of my meal. Then out came the Veal Picatta, now given what I said earlier about certain Italian dishes made differently at different restaurants I have to say I&#39;ve never heard of any restaurant serving any thing called &#34;Picatta&#34; without capers. As far as I know Picatta is lemon, capers and butter. Aaron offered to send my veal back and have capers added to it and sauteed a bit longer but that idea just sounded wrong to me. He was nice and did bring us complimentary mini desserts which were excellent but as far as I&#39;m concerned Carrabba&#39;s already has two strikes. We will go back and give them another try but I guarantee you I won&#39;t be ordering the Chicken Cacciatore or the Picatta!"

But since I last came here the menu has become smaller and they got rid of the Hamburg steak. There jajangmyoen is a lil blander then the one I usually eat in Korea but it is still enjoyable. I love getting there teokkbokki which I can&#39;t find anywhere else and don katsu as it is huge and you get it with two different sauces don katsu is basically thin crispy fried pork cutlet. With the don katsu you also get a small salad and rice.The service is friendly for a small family owned restaurant and the food comes out quickly. 
If you come here with a friend I highly recommend the combo set as you get jajangmyeon, black black bean noodles and jamponng, spicy seafood noodles and your choice of either sweet sour pork or don katsu for around 25$. Which is nice and you can share.
 Today instead of getting my usual fare of don katsu or tangsuyeok( sweet sour pork) I got kam pong gi which is crispy deep fried chicken in a garlic sweet savory sauce. It was surprisingly really good, and I might start getting this one instead.

The atmosphere is extremely clean and and welcoming, despite what it might look like from the outside. I also had the tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork) dish which was also not too bad.

Big portions, reasonable prices, and yummy delicious Korean/Chinese food. Mostly Korean so if you want real Chinese food, not your spot to go. 

Came here because I&#39;m a sucker for jjajang meon (black bean noodles). And my husband ddukboki. And I have to say this place does it right. 

I recommend getting the jjajang ddukboki. It&#39;s a little different than traditional ddukboki, but it has a fiery kick to it. Plus for $10 you get a big plate with two hard boiled eggs, ramen noodles, and rice noodle. Definitely filling as is. Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not as spicy as I make it sound. 

The jjajang meon noodles are on point here. You can tell its home made hand pulled noodles because of the fact you have to use scissors to cut the noodles. Otherwise you&#39;ll just make a huge mess and trust me. Black bean sauce is hard to get out. Perfect texture noodles and with the perfect amount of sauce. Though I wish they would slice a bit more cucumbers into the dish. 

Service was nice, friendly and attentive. They did speak a lot of Korean to each other (at least you know you&#39;re getting legit Korean food). But then I came in around 2:30 on a Monday afternoon. We were basically the only ones... But they do have lunch specials that end at 2:30. From what I saw it was reasonable (less than $10)."

Combo B is the same noodle dishes + donkatsu instead. Same price. Seems like a pretty good deal.

I like the jjajang at P&amp;Y better, but I think Yong Gung&#39;s tangsooyook is definitely better.. just seems more fresh.. tangier.. and the sauce had better consistency.

Food:  Definitely worth the price, HUGE portions, taste &amp; appearance were awesome.  Food arrived to our table quick, I don&#39;t even think we waited 15 minutes.  These are the items we ordered:
Spicy Korean Fried Chicken-comes with rice &amp; salad
Jab Che-comes as is, with beef.  no rice or salad....this dish was filled with so many onions and different kinds of vegetables that the rice was not missed LOL
Jab Tang Bap-this is by far my favorite dish today....it was filled was different kinds of seafood (shrimp, squid, mussels, etc), vegetables, etc......flavor was so good.

This was our first experience so we ordered 3 different dishes not expecting to go home with A LOT of leftovers.  Yummmmmmmmy!!  We will be back to try other dishes they have to offer."

I didn&#39;t like how the slaw had thousand island sauce that tasted store bought. The chicken was too sweet (sweeter than the average sweet Korean fried chicken) but I liked the sticky texture of the sauce. I was surprised by how big, clean &amp; spacious the restaurant was. It was empty when I came on a Monday night but it got busy around 7PM. The beef and broccoli dish was slightly bitter due to the charred remains of the wok from perhaps another dish (I&#39;m unsure). The portion size for the chicken was larger than I expected and was fair for the beef and rice dish. Side dishes (banchan-they come free and you can refill them) that came with the chicken included yellow pickled radish (danmuji), spicy pickled cabbage (kim chi) and a salty black bean sauce (chunjang I think). Service was great and fast. My dishes came out faster than I expected. I would definitely like to come back here again and try their noodle dishes and spicy rice cake (Tteokbokki)."

The service has improved immensely, and the food is almost always on par. The food usually comes out pretty quickly, too!

Most of the noodle dishes here are good because they pull the noodles in house, so they&#39;re going to be a lot more fresh than other places.

If you&#39;re new to Korean/Chinese cuisine and you are a Vegetarian, you can opt to get the Gan Jja Jang with no meat. Most of the other noodles dishes are prepared with beef/chicken broth.

I usually get the Vegetable Gan Jja Jang or Vegetable Fried Rice. The fried rice is on the oily side (and sometimes salty side), but it really depends on the day... If you&#39;re going to get fried rice, I would highly suggest asking for Jja Jang (black bean) sauce on the side and eating it together! Trust me, you won&#39;t regret it.

Update: they recently added a Jja Jang Ddukbokki and it is amazinggg. It&#39;s the spicy rice cake dish with the black bean sauce with ramen noodles too!! It&#39;s incredibly spicy, but I prefer it (x100) over the regular spicy rice cake. Yummmm."

The bowls are huge! One bowl looks like it can feed two people. Unfortunately, there is so little meat in it that it can barely count for one person. I think each of us got two small bites of pork, about 3 prawns with shells, and a few small strips of squid.  The noodles were plenty, and the texture of them was good.  Just wish the broth had some more spice and flavor to it. It was lacking in both.  Additionally, the selection of kimchi that is brought to the table was very limited. I believe only 3 items plus a (hoisin?) sauce.

-The dongkatsu is HUGE and comes with two sauce options (curry and dongkatsu sauce).

yong-gung-aurora,Kevin D.,MXsk0Cy3JPpYis-ZcltcgA,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,1,0,0,21,kytKfHqmb_dSxDPLyJuTNw,1.0,2015-11-22,"Where to begin. The waiter I had could not answer a very basic set of questions. I asked how big one of their noodle bowls were. Now at most restaurants the waiter or waitress shows you with their hands a rough size of the bowl when you ask this. This guy said &#34;uhhh...&#34; Then pointed to a table where the patrons had small bowls and said &#34;it&#39;s that size. So not too big&#34;. Keep in mind I&#39;m the only guy eating at my table. The bowl comes out and it&#39;s big enough to serve six people maybe seven. Not only did he lie about it being &#34;not too big&#34; but he also couldn&#39;t answer a question I brought up about the kind of noodle. I asked &#34;what kind of noodle is used in this?&#34; To which he replied &#34;they all use the same noodle&#34;. Young man, I did not ask if they were all the same, I asked WHAT KIND OF NOODLE is in this dish.

Additionally I asked if they have beer. They don&#39;t serve alcohol but that&#39;s a minor disappointment at most. But when I asked for a soda it was brought out not from a fountain served cup, but with a cup and a can.

I don&#39;t ask for any waiter to be smiley and bubbly although many waiters practice their skill with service to that extent. I get it, you&#39;re paid minimum wage, you don&#39;t enjoy this. But did I feel welcome in this business? No absolutely not. The female hostess that greeted me was friendly and warm. The kid who served me in his twenties...did not make me feel welcome in the slightest. Aside from being garbage at presenting the menu to me with the questions I asked he didn&#39;t smile once, and rolled his eyes when coming to my table as if it were an inconvenience to him.

Lastly, this pathetic excuse for a waiter, when I paid with cash had the nerve to ask me if I wanted change. As if implying he deserved a tip. My total was $24.76. A massive charge for what I thought would be a noodle soup for one person but instead could&#39;ve fed a whole family. As well as some chicken dish that didn&#39;t even come with rice. I asked for rice and it came out in a very tiny bowl. After paying with thirty dollars and him assuming he deserved to keep my change he returned with my $5.24. I&#39;m not sure why I left him $1.24. I feel like he didn&#39;t deserve the 24 cents either.

That wasn&#39;t the worst waiter experience I&#39;ve had but it was down there with the level of outright incompetence. I&#39;m not sure if he tried to scam me with the size of the noodle bowl by telling me it wasn&#39;t &#34;too big&#34; or if he was just outright incompetent in the position of the most basic customer service skills. Mind you, I&#39;m the only guy sitting at my table, so one would assume I&#39;m interested in a noodle bowl for myself. I&#39;m 5&#39;8 and weigh 168 pounds. I don&#39;t look like an overweight guy, and I clearly don&#39;t look like someone who would eat a family size bowl of noodle soup.

My advice to this business, fire this guy. Not sure if he&#39;s family you&#39;re trying to help out or if he was actually someone you believed was qualified to work with customers but it&#39;s obvious he is garbage in that role. I&#39;ve had better service at a McDonald&#39;s in the ghetto than I&#39;ve had with this guy so that&#39;s saying something. He may have better fortune working drive-thru there.

On a positive note, I did like the atmosphere of the place. Clean, well organized. The menu was colorful and well put together, save for the fact that the summer stuff was still in there. But all around not a bad environment and setting. The food was also quite delicious. The lack of rice coming out to accompany my chicken was strange to me but I did like the food. It was very tasty. Just had trash for a waiter."

I saw multiple tables with 3 generations, from grandparents to babies, sitting down to happily enjoy a delicious meal. From the looks of it, the jia jiang myeon (noodles with black bean sauce), don katsu (breaded and fried pork cutlets served with curry sauce), and the spicy seafood noodle soup are their most popular signature dishes. There is even a combination special that you can order with full sized servings of these 3 dishes for $23, which is an awesome deal! 

I know everyone raves over the black bean noodle dish but for me it wasn&#39;t that special. The noodles do definitely have that nice chewy bite to them, but the black bean sauce with onions over top was a bit bland for my taste. Perhaps if the sauce contained meat and was spicier, like the Chinese version of the same named dish, I would have enjoyed it more. Or maybe I was just expecting the Chinese version; whatever the reason, while it wasn&#39;t bad, I would skip it on future visits. But the don katsu...OMG...it was the best!!! 3 huge pieces came on this gigantic platter, complete with a sweet savory curry sauce, white rice, and salad...SO GOOD! I love that curry sauce and would happily slurp a bowlful of it by itself. Yum! Finally, the seafood noodle dish is also great. A nice assortment of seafood in the bowl, including shrimp, squid, and mussels. I believe there were also some chunks of chicken in there. The broth is nicely spiced without being overly salty.

My family of 5 ordered 5 dishes and the total only came to $44 and change, including tax. We could not finish all the food and ended up taking enough leftovers home that will suffice for 3 additional lunch portions. Service was very fast and attentive in the beginning when we arrived at 11:30a because we were the only ones in the restaurant but within half an hour, the place got very busy. Understandably, the waiter was busy attending to other customers and we sat around probably an extra 15 minutes waiting for our check and take out containers, but that was fine since we weren&#39;t in any rush. I saw some people go up to the cash register directly to pay to expedite the process. Despite the wait and simple service, I&#39;ve got to give this place 5 stars based on the food alone.

1: dont feel left out.  You are welcomed as much as any other paying customers.  They might prefer you since you wouldn&#39;t be so demanding.  Haha. jk

2: if they dont see you after few minutes of standing arpund, flag them down.  You don&#39;t need special words. 

3: if you are not sure,  ask the sever.   Treat it kinda like pho restaurants. Most pho restaurants will never bring you the bill unless you ask for it.  All else fails,  walk up to the cashier.   

4. These types of restaurants (noodle house catering to Koreans) usually serves condiments consisting of kimchee, pickled yellow diakon, sliced onions and jajang sauce base.  If you want to look like local,  put some vinegar all over the diakon and onions. If you need more, just ask.  Flag them down!

* lastly, dont be shy and ask.  I did!

The parking outside can be a little of a nightmare, especially when a few doors down... this establishment shared to that FAMOUS Korean BBQ.  This recent visit was on SUNDAY May 19th 2013.  Time was about 18:40hrs ish.  

Well, thankfully when we arrived at this establishment, we were seated promptly.  I knew by instant, that it was like that OLD Korean restaurant which I have reviewed many moons ago, and it which that &#34;KFC&#34; aka &#34;SPICY&#34; Korean Fried Chicken ran away with it...  This establishment is owned by a Korean but they also offer Korean and Chinese Dishes...

From the Server recommendations, he said, this establishment is known for their Black Bean and Spicy Soup and also the Fried Rice.  Well in general a lot of Koreans who go to this establishment would order those items...

From the simple menu that they offer, here were the items we ordered that evening :

*  Vegetable Egg Roll *A1 ($6.95)
*  Fried Rice With Crab Meat - Arros Frit-Crab *R1 ($8.95) 
*  Deep Fried Chicken In Hot Pepper Sauce - Canpungkee-Pollo *P4 ($14.95) - Hubs Order

Hubs opt for Coke Cola ($1.50) for his beverages while I just opt for water.  While we were waiting for our order to be ready, our server provide us several Banchan something like Raw White Onions, Kimchi, Black Sauce and Pickled Radish.

When our order arrived at our table, all came out piping HOT, meaning out from the Fryer, I like.  The service was friendly, efficient and fast.

When my order of Fried Rice came, it smelled good, but where is the CRAB??  I asked in my heart.  But with the smell of HOT Fried Rice, smell slightly &#34;CRABY&#34; aka &#34;Fishy&#34; in slightly a good way, I guess.  My Fried Rice comes with the Black Soybean Sauce and the Spicy Soup.  I like the Spicy Soup that comes with the Fried Rice.  With that Spicy Soup alone, I am NOW Intrigued by that Spicy Soup... coz our server recommends it.  

I am so awed when Hubs rate this establishment as 4 stars at best, and one of the Best Egg Roll he ever had.  To me it was just FRIED SPRING ROLL filled with Julienned Carrots and Cabbage, if I could recall correctly.  Hubs also like his order of Deep Fried Chicken in Hot Pepper Sauce, though he wish the dish could MORE SPICY.  Our server offer us several spicy sauce from the Kitchen, but still it wasn&#39;t spicy enough for our taste bud.  Well all in all, I rate this establishment 3.5 stars and definitely want to return when needed.  The cost of our Dinner was $34.97 with tax.  Left the establishment at 19:35hrs.

The chick neng myun (cold noodles) here was really good. The size of the bowl was extremely big (same size as the largest mixing bowl I own) but I was able to eat about 75% of the noodles and 30% of the broth. A weird ingredient in the neng myun was the shredded chicken pieces. The chicken tasted fine, but I have never seen chicken in any of the hundreds of bowls of neng myun I have eaten. The only thing that this neng myun lacked was Asian Pears. There was only one thin slice of pear in my 3 gallon bowl of neng myun.

The &#34;tang su yuk&#34; sweet and sour pork came on enormous platter. It was huge that we weren&#39;t able to finish it and there were 7 of us at the table! I am not a huge fan of this dish to begin with (and I rarely eat it) so I don&#39;t know really how it compares to tang su yuk.

You get 3 shrimps, 3 mussels and a skimpy bit of squid and pork for about $9.  That&#39;s not a bad price.  What makes this so good is the flavors in the broth.  Many of the other Denver places I tried (see some of my other postings for the detail) either had the wrong noodles or lacked the deep flavors in the broth, but Yong Gung seems to get this right.

This is our top choice for Chinese at the moment!

The jajang-meyong is pretty good here. A

You know, really I don&#39;t know what  a Korean-Chinese restaurant is or why they call it that, I just know that if I have a craving for jajang-meyong or any other popular noodle dish from my heritage, I go to a Korean-Chinese restaurant.  
I had some jajang-meyong and it was pretty good.  Basically some noodles with a black bean sauce, much like a bolognese except a black bean flavor instead of tomato.  
In addition to jajang-meyong (its a pain typing that word out) they also have chap chae which is a clear vermicelli noodle flavored with sesame oil and soy sauce and with a vegetable medley.  
So if your in A town in the Korean strip of Havana, give some exotic noodles a try."

The black bean sauce is also fresh and very tasty with each bite of onion and kimchi. Should be a staple in any household.

Making pastry dough is not hard, most restaurants do not do it, this place does it!........ order the hand made Crab Rangoon, eat it with the kimchee....trust me a match made in heaven...

Kimchi is also made in house. Some of the best anywhere...yes, truly. 

Some american guy was going on and on about how &#34;awesome&#34; the kimchi was at the table next to me. He had a few girlfriends, Chinese or Korean with him, I think they were embarrassed, but this dude loved their kimchi!

I have tried almost all of the soup dishes....amazing and all very different. They also have a fried pork dish with a sweet and sour sauce, very tasty.

Great servers, attentive, cute and one of the most beautifully designed noodle shops in the world, a very special place. Treat them well. A special shop and we want them here for years to come!"

Packs serious spicyness (the kind where if you inhale wrong, your eyes water and your chest feels like it&#39;s on fire), but also amazing flavor at the same time.  Noodles are nice and chewy (and soften up a little as they sit in the soup). Contains shrimp, mussels, squid,  pork.  

I never finish the soup in noodle soup dishes when I eat out, but this one - THIS ONE - I will.  In fact, I always pack it up to take home and finish.  SO GOOD."

We ordered the typical Korean style Chinese food: jjajang myeon(black bean noodles), tang su yook(sweet and sour pork), and tonkatsu(Japanese cuisine). The noodles were delicious, but we found hair in it. When we told our server, she apologized and let us know they&#39;d prepare another one. Tang su yook was crispy and good too. Tonkatsu was good and the pork was very tender. However, they had their own sauce which has curry in it. I thought it was really good, but I&#39;d you like the traditional sauce, you may not like it.

I had a straight up Philly cheesesteak this time with just the cheese and onions...  It comes on the traditional Amorosa rolls and came hot, greasy, and cheesy just like I like it.  I went with the smaller 8in one and got the meal because it was basically the same price as the sandwich and a small fries.  The fries were good and fresh hot and the soda fountain has a good selection.  When I finished my sandwich I bought a couple of dollars in quarters and played video games in the back.

Then, I kept hearing around from employees they go to one south of work, near 22nd and Quebec.  But, until recently, had I tried it out.  I mean, could it really be better?  I mean, don&#39;t they get their ingredients from the same place?  Possibly.

I came here one day to give it a shot.  It is opened a little later, which makes it more appealing.  They also serve beer, and have an outdoor patio (but I have not had any beer since I have only visited during my lunch @ work).  

This place is located in a mini shopping area tucked right in a residential neighborhood- you can miss it easy if you don&#39;t use GPS.  I like that, since it doesn&#39;t seem like it is in a hectic area.

the indoor dining area is small, with a fountain machine, and the counter in the back corner.  Order your food, and they will bring it to you.  The first time I went, I got a 12&#34; regular (cheese, onion).  It was cooked pretty quickly.  I hauled ass back to work and ate it.  There was something special about that cheesesteak.  It was juicy, cheesy, and the bread was perfectly soft.  I was pissed I only got one.

After my former boss (who now works in Portland) came back for a week to help out, I had not seem him until the night before he was leaving back to Portland.  i told him I would take him to dinner.  I picked him up from his hotel, and brought him here.

When we pulled up, he said that is where HE ate for lunch that day, what are the odds?  He enjoyed it so much, he didn&#39;t mind having it twice in a day!  Ha!

That night, they had a sign posted with a special- 2 12&#34; steaks and a soda for $14.99.  What a deal!  So we both got one.  Ha!

And they came out quickly as well.  And yes, between both of us, we ate 4 feet of cheesesteaks.  Did we feel fat? Yes.  Did we have shame? Absolutely not.

If you live in Denver and crave a killer cheesesteak, I would recommend starting here!"

I have always loved their food, the cheese steaks are amazing, all the sides are great.  It is super cool how they have different local taps every time I come in.  However I don&#39;t know how they are still in business.  Service is sometimes pleasant but often doesn&#39;t want to give me the time of day.  The worst part is that they frequently close much earlier than stated hours.  For a while, every time we went in for carry out after about 745 (close at 9) they would be cleaning up the place and would give us dirty looks, act annoyed with us, and probably spit in our food.  I have worked in restaurants, I&#39;m not a jerk, wouldn&#39;t walk into a place 10 minutes before close and ask to be served.  I&#39;m talking carry out over an hour before their stated closing time.  We stopped ordering from them if we couldn&#39;t get over there by 7:30.  Then, the 3 most recent times we tried to order, they were closed.  Around 7pm on Friday and Saturday nights.  Twice we went there and everything was just dark and closed, no signs like &#34;sorry dude, we ran out of steaks&#34; or anything, the third time we just called and it went to voice mail.  Forget it.  They obviously don&#39;t want our business, so we went from ordering 2-3 times a month to never eating there again.  Which breaks my heart, and the day I see a sign here that says &#34;Under new management&#34; will be the happiest day of my life.

Being 5 blocks from the shop, I&#39;d expect a relatively quick delivery and some level of accuracy.  Yet consistently, they average less than a 50% rate for delivering a correct order, and despite the 5min drive, as much a 3hr delivery time. 

Simply put, and in consideration of all other variables, these issues are due to utterly incompetent help.  (especially evident when they try to &#34;fix&#34; their mistakes, an hour after you&#39;ve finished eating)

Yes. Bacon. On a cheesesteak.

Just when you thought this meal couldn&#39;t get any worse for your health... or better for your tastebuds....

They do fresh cut fries which are never quite crispy enough for me, but it&#39;s a nice option to have.

I was in the store around 06:30 and the young lady at the register taking orders was very helpful and pleasant. 

I had a large steak with jalapenos, extra cheese with lettuce and tomatoes on the side. I also ask about the french fries as many have stated that they weren&#39;t up to par as being Good. She ask what my traveling distance was and then stated that they could make them crispy so that they wouldn&#39;t be soggy.   

Have to say,the steak sandwich was good and plentiful in regards to the fillings ... the fries were crispy and still warm mind you I only live 2 miles away. The Boylan birch beer soda which I had while waiting was the BOMB. 

I only have three suggestion for this restaurant and they are;
1) use a garlic salt and black pepper seasoning for the fries.
2) use a thicker cut of potato for the fries maybe even a steak fry cut.
3) have a bin that customers can use to recycle the bottles and cans from your vast selection of sodas. Just the thought of all those bottles going into the landfill makes me ill.

Note: I once worked for a restaurant that specialized in Philly cheese steak sandwiches ... the name was Acapella&#39;s on 17th ave. Well known in the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s. And the owner&#39;s were from Philly and knew what a cheese steak should taste like hence they taught me. I never got what the whole thrill about the tastykakes."

I&#39;m excited for the &#34;beer garden&#34; to open in the summer as I imagine myself sitting in the sun, gorging on cheesesteaks and tater tots, and drinking pitcher after pitcher of refreshing Coors Lite (note: it DOES taste different here in Denver!).

Pro tip:
2 medium cheesesteaks + 1 basket of tater tots w/ cheese + 1 pitcher of beer = $20
FANTASTIC lazy Sunday meal."

Famous Philly Cheese Steaks serves, by far, the most successful cheese steak in Denver.  When I find a better one, I promise to let you know.  

The Good &amp; Bad Rundown:
+ perfectly melted cheese cradles every bite
+ provolone, American cheese, or cheez-whiz 
+ Amoroso bread is chewy and soft; perfect for the warm, cheesy filling
+ different peppers (i.e. hot, green, sweet, jalapeno)
+ three different sandwich sizes
+ perfectly seasoned filling (not bland or too salty)
+ chicken or other sandwich options
- kind of greasy/dirty inside"

I&#39;m from Philly, I grew up eating cheesesteaks. There are actually quite a few different versions of a Philly cheesesteak (dependent on where you lived). The big fight for the crown of Philly cheesesteak in Philly typically boils down to either Pat&#39;s or Geno&#39;s. While both of those are great cheesesteaks, theyre not what I grew up eating (I lived in Delaware County and my cheesesteak was different from Pat&#39;s/Geno&#39;s).

I have been searching for a great cheesesteak since I moved here a year+ ago. I&#39;m surprised I havent stumbled upon this place in my searches before today. 

Its off my beaten path, and the dining room is no 5 star restaurant...but its exactly fitting for what it is, a great place to pick up a quick and incredibly tasty cheesesteak.

When i walked in this morning around 11am, the dining room was empty except for one customer. I was greeted kindly by the female cashier. She took my order quickly (a 12&#34; cheesesteak plain), and said it would be ready in a few mins. I sat down and she came around the counter and chatted with me while filling up some sodas (most likely for the staff). Within 2 mins my order (to go) was ready and brought to me wrapped and ready to go. I thanked the cook and he thanked me for visiting.

I drove to work (25 mins away), and when i got there i sat down to have lunch. I was astounded at how warm (still) and perfect this cheesesteak was. The Amoroso roll was perfect, and the balance of steak and cheese was spot on. It was greasy, and cheesy, and the best cheesesteak I&#39;ve had since I last lived in Philly in 2005. It was THAT f#%&amp;ing good. I seriously couldnt have asked for a better cheesesteak.

If youre near the area, I highly recommend trying these guys out. I plan on visiting them as often as I can.

If they were open Sundays in the winter I would be going there this Sunday as its the most convenient day for me to swing by that way. 

Also a bonus, when I was leaving I saw a Pennsylvania license plated car in the lot. Made it feel like home.  :)"

Also they forgot my fries which was really annoying I waited over 30 more minutes for my fries. I should at least get a free meal.

After reading the great reviews, I was excited that there was supposedly a delicious, authentic cheesesteak place close to my home. Unfortunately, this joint is not the real deal. If you have read any of my other cheesesteak reviews, you will know that I take my cheesesteaks very seriously. Sadly, we have another Philly cheesesteak imposter. 

First off, the meat was all wrong. It was too thin and lacked the flavor and texture that makes a good cheesesteak. It was quite mushy and reminded me of ground beef. I was actually pretty disturbed by it. Second, the amoroso rolls weren&#39;t like the delicious ones they serve in Philly or even Denver Ted&#39;s. They were way too soft. It lacked the chew that makes an authentic Philly cheesesteak. This soft bread only made the steak mush feel mushier. There was no texture - just straight up mush.  Third, the whiz was all wrong. In fact, I would go as far to say it wasn&#39;t whiz. I am going to sound crazy here as I go on a cheese whiz rant but that stuff they claimed to be whiz wasn&#39;t the real deal either. I got a side of it to dip their boring fries in and was immediately taken back by the disgusting taste. I know cheese whiz isn&#39;t known for being some gourmet cheese but this stuff was gross. It tasted like the cheese you would get at a bowling alley. Cheese whiz can&#39;t be that expensive, so I&#39;m confused as to why they would skimp there. I was just very disappointed. 

I have a difficult time referring to this place as a beer garden. With only beers such as Miller Lite, Budweiser, and Coors Light available, I would be hesitant to call it a &#34;beer garden.&#34; Maybe I missed their local beers or something but this beer garden really seemed to be lacking some quality beers.  

In sum, I disliked this place. If you enjoy mushy sandwiches and Miller Lite, you may like Famous Philly Cheesesteaks and Beer Garden. If you are looking for the real deal, this isn&#39;t it. If you want legit, go to Denver Ted&#39;s. That place knows Philly cheesesteaks. So much for a delicious cheesesteak place close by. I would not even revisit based on convenience."

Don&#39;t do it to yourself. Placed order via grubhub to eliminate confusion as previous orders had been screwed up. Called to confirm that everything was available &amp; was assured that all was in order. Yet &amp; still, 3 items were wrong or unavailable. The drink I specifically inquired about, unavailable. Instead of the large hoagie I ordered, rec&#39;d a medium. The chicken cheesesteak was delivered without cheese. Called them about it...they agreed to replace the hoagie but argued about the cheesesteak having cheese on it. A simple apology really would have sufficed but arrogance, profanity, &amp; attitude is the apparent method of choice here. Physically take both the steak &amp; hoagie in to show them &amp; the &#34;manager&#34; looks at neither &amp; throws them in the trash. No apology, not even the slightest attempt...again, just threats, profanity, attitude, &amp; nonsensical talk of how we&#39;re not above her (inferiority complex much?). If you&#39;re unhappy with your station in life...get up, get out, &amp; do something about it. Don&#39;t get mad at me because you&#39;ve peaked where others start. Taking your misery out on customers is clearly not getting you anywhere in life.

Presumably the owners want to keep their business so why they would entrust it to one so immature &amp; lacking in skills of any kind (especially customer service) is beyond me. Why I wasted as much time as I did trying to reason with the unreasonable, I don&#39;t know...but I do know I will NEVER patronize this establishment again. 

PS-We&#39;re from Philly &amp; the comment about the service being on par with what you&#39;d experience there is utterly bogus. I have never encountered such poor service &amp; rudeness in my life...with service like that, your food ought to be nothing short of spectacular but every item was subpar AT BEST."

I go there many times for lunch when I substitute teach at the Odyssey School.  Its like 1 minute away.  Super tasty, done right phillies.   All cheesey and melty, with great bread, onions, mushrooms, and peppers.  Hits the spot.

Really fast service, easy, and tasty.  You&#39;re certainly not in Philly, your in Denver, so make sure to keep that in mind.

Just really loved everything about this place. Chef/Owner, Lennon Villarose, has a clear vision for Charm 3--locally sourced, high-quality and mostly organic ingredients lovingly brought together and served up in a warm and inviting environment.  When you look in the cases the first thing you think is--oh yeah, this is real from-scratch, homemade awesomeness, from the salads and quiches, to the amazing pastries and pies (also saw some incredible looking paninis going across the counter!).  Can&#39;t recommend this place enough!!!

Had the Portabella Mushroom and Goat Cheese Quiche, with a cup of Tuscan Bean Soup, followed by an amazing (and GENEROUS) slice of vegan apple pie.  Quiche was killer--super fluffy and yummy, with a perfectly flaky crust, and the soup had a surprising little kick to it that gave it a fun distinction from typical versions of this classic.  The pie?  DAMN! LOL Apple pie has been one of my favorites since I was a kid, and this was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had!!!  BIG chunky pieces of apple baked perfectly...super flavorful, not mushy, and an awesome crust.  Honestly, I usually leave half the crust behind when I eat pie, but ate every bite of this one! LOL

Anyway, I was so impressed by this place that I asked Chef Villarose if she could make me a mixed dessert tray for an event I was hosting the next day for 25 guests.  I think she usually asks for a little more notice, but with just 24 hours notice she graciously put together an awesome assortment.  My guests LOVED her stuff, and the no-gluten folks were super excited about the GF Apricot bars (btw - she seems to offer a really nice assortment of vegan and GF items)!  And the bonus--when I returned the next day to pick up my tray, she had just come up with a brand new creation: a Caramel Pear Tart with Chocolate Sauce.  OMG, these things are AMAZING!!!  Don&#39;t know if she&#39;s going to be making them a regular thing, but these things would be worth the trip themselves! Villarose is doing it right in Centennial--BIG thumbs up!"

We thoroughly enjoyed the chill vibe of the place paired with the charming mismatched china and nifty cloth napkins. Think local coffeehouse meets a relaxed afternoon tea!  A great marriage. The food here is authentic Americana and made from scratch.  The sausage and cheddar quiche was brimming with a delicious house made sausage of pork shoulder ground up with maple syrup and a house blend of spices. The house lemonade was refreshing and tangy, not overly sweet. The meatball sandwich had the perfect amount of spice and was brilliantly toasted up on a panini, served up with a side of freshly sliced apple. The special Italian beef sandwich was well seasoned and had a tasty antipasto blend of finely chopped veggies atop the beef. It too was served panini style and toasted to perfection. My salad trio platter was fresh and unique. The kale salad full of flavor from slices of freshly pickled radish and roasted butternut squash sprinkled with goat cheese served with a zingy house dressing. The kale may have needed to be chopped up more and perhaps massaged with a bit of lemon juice and olive oil to tenderize it a bit. The quinoa salad blend included roasted red peppers and asparagus. It was hearty and homestyle good. My favorite was the creamy chicken salad that had a delicious crunch from chopped celery, apples and some nuts.  Desserts here are spectacular. The coconut cream pie was sweet and creamy but not too rich. It was like eating a creamy coconut cloud. The apple crumble pie was fresh and gluten free. No butter here. Coconut oil and organic palm oil was used as a healthy alternative to butter.  Good for vegetarians and good for your heart! All the autumn apple pie flavor was there in the form of a much healthier fat!  Kudos to owner Lennon for caring so much about her customers and using healthy quality ingredients in her homemade cooking.  My daughter&#39;s favorite was the peanut butter cookie.

Luckily after ordering some mimosas we found some seats at the bar. 

The food was pretty average, we had the breakfast corn dogs and they were pretty meh. We then shared the slopper and the green chili was decent, it was served on a big plate but there was not much on the plate. 

Overall you come for the bottomless mimosas and stay awhile, but that&#39;s the best part of the district."

I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve been there for any other occasion, but I have a great time whenever I go.  That may have something to do with their great brunch and hh drink specials, but I also really love the casual atmosphere, especially when sitting on the patio. 

I&#39;ve seen other reviews complain about the service, but I have no recollection of anything but very good service. I&#39;m not big on breakfast food, so for brunch I always order their breakfast burrito which is excellent.  As for happy hour food, they have a major discount on side orders. I&#39;ve enjoyed all I&#39;ve tried, especially the chicken wings. Sandwiches were good too, never had any entres other than fish and chips (which my wife devours).

Leaving the best for last, their tap beer list is fantastic, not sure how many taps they have (I&#39;d guess around 25) but it is definitely a nice selection."

They offered mix and match bottomless which is my favorite ! You could choose between sangria, bloodies, mimosas, and screwdrivers. It was a make your own bottomless bar so there were lots of options for juices and ingredients. Our waitress was a little slow about bringing us our booze to use at the bar, but she seemed extremely busy so I don&#39;t really hold this against her. 

I got the veggie breakfast hash. I ordered the veggie option not because I&#39;m a vegetarian, but because I really wanted the veggies. The person I was with got the breakfast hash with bacon and she also had veggies. She may have had a few less veggies than me, but the difference was not noticeable so don&#39;t order the veggie version of the breakfast hash unless you don&#39;t eat meat. My biggest complaint about the breakfast hash was that the peppers and onions were warm but not cooked all the way. I just didn&#39;t love the dish overall, but again they were super busy so might have just been rushing to get food out. I would definitely try this place again. It looked like there were tons of delicious options on the menu, but I would probably go with something other than the breakfast hash."

I love their location on 17th. I also like the casual layout, patio, big open windows, and silver Christmas bulbs hanging from the ceiling. Cozy little bar as well. 

I&#39;m not real crazy about their menu. I just can&#39;t seem to find anything very interesting to order. Burgers, club sandwich, macaroni and cheese. An unusual assortment of appetizers: fried plantains, Brussel sprouts, sliders, charcuterie. It&#39;s New American but the menu just seems a little all over the place. I&#39;ve had a bison burger a few times and while the meat was very good and cooked perfectly, the burger overall was pretty bland. I also feel like their mashed potatoes taste a little powdery/cafeteria-y. 

I do appreciate and enjoy that they smoke all their meats in house and make their own sausages and bacon (try the lamb bacon!). I think they use mostly fresh ingredients and the food presentation is always on point. 

Nice drink menu as well. The signature moonshine drinks are strong and bizarre. Try the District Lemonade with pepper moonshine and cayenne. Great and spicy. Happy Hour from 3-6 and 10-close everyday!"

Food selection is pretty decent with your standard brunch items like eggs benny, breakfast burritos, huevos rancheros, omelettes, etc. They even have scotch eggs (under their appetizers) which was REALLY good. Definitely get an order of those if you come to the District. 

As for food quality, with the exception of the scotch eggs, the food was pretty mediocre. I ended up getting the fried chicken eggs benedistrict. It was kind of weird (scrambled eggs, gravy, fried chicken on a biscuit, whutt???) since it just wasn&#39;t your traditional eggs benedict (where&#39;s my poached egg and my english muffin?), which I guess is fine. It came with a side of potatoes (potatoes are potatoes so that was fine too) and fresh fruit (wish my fruit was cold). BF got the huevos rancheros. He said it was alright, nothing spectacular. Portion sizes are larger than normal so I think it&#39;s worth the bang for your buck and a plus. 

Environment was more young / causal / loud probably because everyone is tipsy. I wouldn&#39;t recommend bringing your kids here (though I did see some families here, which was odd). This place definitely of drinking and boozy brunches (which I am ALL for). They even have a bottomless mimosa special (yes please)! I didn&#39;t get a chance to try it out since I had an important event that day, but would come back to check it out. 

My recommendation? Check it out and then see if you&#39;d come back."

I have come here twice for brunch now, and it is awesome.  I love that they have brunch until 4, since sometimes, you just get a late start on the weekends, but still need to satisfy that breakfast craving!   Their menu is pretty extensive too.  I&#39;ve had the smoked salmon appetizer (delicious, and so fresh), the breakfast burrito, and the breakfast tacos, which were the only thing I probably wouldn&#39;t get again.  They were good, but kind of small, and just not that satisfying (but perfect if you&#39;re looking for a healthier choice).

The awesome thing about their bottomless bar, is that you can mix and match, the bloody mary bar, sangria, screwdrivers, or mimosas, with different juice options, all for one price!  Definitely an amazing deal.  The service has always been good as well, but it does slow down when it&#39;s busy. I typically don&#39;t mind, because I&#39;m with good company, and the mimosas keep you busy.  The first time I went, I ordered the bottomless option but only ended up having two drinks, so the waitress actually adjusted my bill so I was not overcharged, which I thought was really great of her.  They also have a full bar, and TV&#39;s, perfect for watching all the important games!

I went yesterday with friends, and am totally debating if I need to go again today before the weekend is over. I can&#39;t wait til all the snow melts so we can scoot there from our apartment, and enjoy the patio life."

Since we often eat in the neighborhood, we decided to still give it a shot.  

They have a fantastic draft list with many of my favorite breweries.  The nachos we got were very simple but hit the spot.  We then decided to split the chicken and waffles and were super impressed.  Not like any other chicken and waffles I have had.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the batter they used was quite spicy which complemented the waffles and syrup very well.

Our waitress came by and I ordered their passion fruit beer (I can&#39;t quite recall the name). I think interesting is the best word for it....it&#39;s not super sweet, it&#39;s not super hoppy. It&#39;s not good, it&#39;s not bad. Try it if you want, but I&#39;d go with something else. 
I ordered the chicken and waffles. First off, I&#39;m not a huge stickler for presentation. As long as the food gets in my belly, I&#39;m happy. But the presentation of this dish was seriously just amazing. Rather than the waffle with some chicken tenders thrown on I expected, I got 3 mini Belgian waffles with little pieces of chicken on them with a dollop of seasoning. It was seriously almost too cute to eat. Almost. I ate the entire thing and was stuffed. 
The service was decent. I&#39;ve been to nicer places. I&#39;ve been to worse places. But I think this place is worth a try."

The prices weren&#39;t great but the bartender was the highlight. Not sure of his name, but he had a long ginger beard and appeared to have a soul. He was polite and welcoming and worked hard.

We were seated promptly and drink orders were taken as we waited for a few people.  They have a nice selection of &#34;comfort food&#34;.  I settled on the bacon, jalapeno mac n cheese.

Our waitress gave us good service and refilled our drinks quickly. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. My dish was a little weird. It was supposed to be grilled mahi with pineapple salsa, slaw and sauce. My Mahi was way overcooked and very tdry. There was about a half teaspoon of salsa, a ton of plain cabbage and then a very light dusting of a bland pink sauce. On the side was a bowl of white rice topped with regular salsa and black beans. This was a very strange dish and not executed well. I did mention it to the waitress an asked for more of the pineapple salsa, but she brought me more of the pink sauce.

I really wanted to like this place, as I am a big fan of that area of town in general. We had two friends get there before us, and got a table for 6. Once we got there and met them inside, the table was more like for 4 people. Keep in mind, we are all pretty small people. That was kind of annoying, but my significant other ended up just grabbing the table that was next to us and moved it to ours. Fortunately, either no one noticed or no one happened to care.
They have the bottomless bloody mary and mimosas option, which is the one positive - they had a lot of different juices for the mimosas. The service was actually HORRIBLE. So incredibly slow. She actually forgot one of our friends orders, and he could only stay briefly. He ended up getting no food, and she still charged him for his one mimosa. Would have been nice to comp being that you total forgot his food he ordered? Everything on the menu had eggs, I do not eat eggs, so I ordered a BLT. Very under impressive, and the side of fruit had like 4 pieces of small fruit.  The last thing I will say was that this place was HOT, like hotter than hell. I get the large garage doors is appealing, and gives you the vibe of being outside when you aren&#39;t outside, but when its 90+ degrees outside?

On the first occasion, we liked the expansive brunch menu and felt like our food was pretty good.  Nothing to write home about - but worth returning for from time to time when brunch called our name.

On the second occasion, I had one of the worst dining experiences I&#39;ve had in a long while.  Again for brunch, we waited a reasonable 15 minutes to be seated, less than we were told we might wait, and so we were pleased to get seated quickly despite the busy-ness of brunch time.  Upon being seated, no server came over to greet us for about 10 minutes.  When our waiter did finally greet us, he said something to the effect of &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we&#39;re pretty busy, I&#39;ll be over in a minute.&#34;  We waited another 6 minutes or so for him to finally come over and ask us what we wanted to drink.  At this point - 20 minutes after having been seated, we were finally served water and had our orders taken.

We then proceeded to wait another 60 minutes for our order - a simple order of biscuits and gravy and fried chicken.  We were habitually ignored and passed over by our waiter and didn&#39;t have our drinks refilled once.  After we had waited about 35 minutes for our order, we inquired how much longer the order might take.  Our waiter went to check for us and told us that the kitchen had burned some brisket, which put many tickets, including ours, behind, and that our order should be out shortly.  We knew this couldn&#39;t be true, because many other tables that had been seated after us had already received their orders.  We waited another 25 minutes, unsure what to do, and without further contact from our waiter.  Finally, the manager came and delivered our food and told us that he believed the ticket was lost or not entered (not what the waiter had admitted to), and he comped our meal, which was mediocre at best.

A few bites into our meal, the waiter came over to see that our meal had already been delivered, said again that he was sorry about how slow the kitchen was (despite it clearly not being a kitchen speed issue), and had the audacity to say &#34;It was worth the wait though, right?&#34;.  No.  Unequivocally, it was not worth the wait - I could have made biscuits and gravy in my kitchen in much less than the 80 minutes that we spent waiting for our food.  And I wouldn&#39;t have had to deal with abysmal service to boot.

It always is disappointing to have such a bad experience at a restaurant, but this is one I will not be returning to."

Came here to bring staff and have cocktails and a night out! We order food and drinks. Our server was honestly should never be a server. 

The entire time it was almost we were asking too much for... Pepper on salads... An extra glass for the pitchers of Mojitos.... MORE WATER?? Seriously you could tell she did not care what so ever. The table to our left of a husband and wife even mentioned the same to us that it was like pulling teeth to get anything out of this girl. 

Finally another 5 staff show up and they ask for more glasses since we have 3 pitches of Mojitos on the table. 

She looks art hem as if it is WAY too much to ask? Seriously this is your job? 

We ask for light ice and no sour in our Mojitos and comes back every time with full to the brim with ice and sour mix. 

We even gave a VERY undeserving tip and left very unsatisfied. 

I write the managers/owners about this terrible customer service experience.... Take 6 days to get back... Then basically asks who it was and they take it seriously... I respond telling who it was and our experience two weeks later and no response. How unprofessional. This was not worth the money and to experience not good drink and terrible customer service I want a refund of my money. It is a complete waste and all left ticked off after the experience we had."

One time a gigantic green bug (I think a kind of grasshopper?) landed on my inside table from the open window. I nearly peed my pants and our server just kind of laughed. Another time we were there literally two hours for brunch, and not in a good, enjoying bottomless mimosas kind of way. Once I found a twist tie in my salad.

Before we even finished one, we already had the next ready..my kind of breakfast!

The reason I&#39;m giving this place 3 starts is because the food was just OK. I ordered the breakfast Mac &amp; Cheese and as a Mac &amp; cheese connoisseur it was sub par to my standards. My friend got the chicken and waffles(or pancakes I guess they were) and it was a HUGE plate!!! Overall nobody in our group of 8 said their food was great so we will definitely be back for drinks.. And maybe on the food!"

Actually, I love this place for drinking bottomless mimosas, but is there really much of a difference? The different juices in the mimosa bar are amazing (my favorite is the guava) and it&#39;s so awesome that you&#39;re able to switch between bottomless bloody marys and mimosas with one price! 
That being said, we had an absolutely terrible experience with our service last time we went. Our server showed up late to work so we were stuck sitting there for about 25 minutes without even getting a glass of water (the hostess had no interest in helping us after she sat us even though she was just standing around). We ended up just going to the bar while we were waiting for our server to show up to get the mimosas rollin&#39;. Once our server showed up, we ordered our food and then 30 minutes after that she forgot to submit half of our orders. I don&#39;t dock places for isolated instances of terrible service, just wanted to make note of it so hopefully it doesn&#39;t happen to other people. Other than that experience, our servers have been great and attentive! 
The food was okay.. I got the breakfast corndogs, and they were fairly average tasting. The bacon sampler is usually pretty good, I&#39;ll probably stick with that next time I go!
This place is in a popular neighborhood and gets pretty busy, so I recommend going right when it opens or making a reservation if you&#39;re with a large group!
All in all, food is pretty good, and the saving grace for this place is killer location, great prices for bottomless beverages, and amazing atmosphere!"

You can switch your &#34;bottomless&#34; drinks between sangria, mimosas, bloody Mary&#39;s, etc. The sangria was alright, but I switched to mimosas so I could take advantage of the &#34;create-your-own&#34; bar with various juices an garnishes for your drink. The breakfast hash was good, but the vegetarian green chile on top was great!!! Even better though, were the plantain waffles. The yumminess of the sauce has stayed in my mind all week, which is not something that happens with most meals. The ambience of this place is fun...and the service is extremely friendly...hopefully next time the weather cooperates so we can sit on the patio."

This is a nice bar with a really pretty patio.  The service was friendly and quick which is hard to get in trendy areas.  I mainly came here to have drinks, but I did end up trying the Caesar salad with grilled chicken.  Not a bad size for $10, but they need to put a whole lot more dressing on the salad.  It was pretty dry.

It&#39;s right next to one of my favorite cafes (The DBC), so was hoping the coolness would seep over.  

There&#39;s a nice seating area outside where we plopped down.  As it was 3p, it was happy hour (one from 3-6, another from 10-1a).  They do have pretty awesome happy hour deals --- the district burger for $6 caught my eye (usually $11).  Alas, I still didn&#39;t take advantage of the deals.  I got the house smoked turkey-avocado Sammie (pretty standard, but had a nice blackberry aioli that gave it a kind of thanksgiving feeling), while my friend got the quadruple grilled cheese (again solid, not mind blowing).  We each had a side salad --- their dressing offerings are pretty unique (had a garlic scallion vinaigrette that was excellent). 

All in all, a nice happy hour experience with good service (server Justin was pretty cool).  Apparently this place has been open for 6 months and gone through 3 chefs --- seems like the offerings are solid enough (can&#39;t compare to old stuff).  Id come back here again for a happy hour or consider its late happy hour (usually struggle to find solid spots in the hood aside from Stuebens open past 10 PM)."

This is definitely a heavy menu so if you are looking for a large, filling meal this is the spot - especially if you start with the loaded fries like we did. Annnnnd the bacon flight. Both of which were AMAZING. They have a couple options for the loaded fries - we gave the Reuben fries a shot and they were very good! Again, super heavy and those combined with bacon, unfortunately, did not leave a lot of room for my dinner which was the pulled pork BUT of the two bites I did have, it was really good :)

They have a great patio with prime people watching, and full service kitchen until 1:30am (who else does that?!)

I think the happy hour is the best deal.  It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6pm, and there&#39;s also a late night happy hour from 10pm-1am on weekends.  They offer beers, wines, wells, and their special District lemonade with vodka or whiskey for good prices.  For food, they have a variety of tasty options.  My favorite is the fries- servings are pretty large, and the toppings are unique and delicious.  You can order reuben, bacon &amp; blue, or Mexican to top &#39;em.  There is a nightly food special as well- I can&#39;t remember which night, but there is a $6 burger which is delicious and a steal!"

They have great drinks and fantastic happy hour deals. I like that they sell some of their signature drinks by the pitcher to share with friends. (They make a margarita with Chili Beer. Get in on a pitcher of that).

Happy Hour food and regular dinner hour appetizers are delicious. I have tried the charcuterie plate (fantastic price for what you get!!) the tri bacon (exactly what it sounds like so of course perfection) and the blue cheese fries (how could you go wrong).
Also the carnitas tacos and mahi mahi tacos are FANTASTIC. Especially the grilled mahi.
The service here is wonderful. They really go out of their way. One time I asked the split the carnitas tacos with someone. The order usually comes with 3 tacos and they gave us 4 JUST BECAUSE. Free stuff is the way to my heart. I also love love love their dog friendly patio and if you bring my dog a bowl of water and a treat you win me over."

The bottomless bar is amazing and such a good deal. They don&#39;t give you those skimpy glasses with mostly orange juice in mimosas either. You make you&#39;re own, essentially. This is always our go-to when we have guests visiting because it never disappoints and there&#39;s never a wait. Portion sizes are not like you&#39;re typical Denver size; they&#39;re big! (I highly recommend the chicken and waffles) We went last week for a bachelorette brunch and everyone was very satisfied with the food, service, and available seating for a large group. I&#39;ve also been there when they sponsored kickball/flip cup tournaments on Wednesday nights and I think it was genius to just post up a grill and sell burgers and hotdogs for that crowd so as to not interfere with the regular dinner crowd (I was part of kickball btw).

We were seated and nobody came over to us for about 10 min. Drinks took a long time to make and our food was severely delayed. I ended up taking to the manager after we waited for a simple whiskey and 7 for 25+minutes. As I was filling in the manager about our situation he stated that &#34;grub hub &#34; had gone down and screwed their system. Mind you the patio was busy and inside had maybe 2-3 tables taken. Manager said he would comp a round of drinks.......kind of lame. So after we almost walked out our food showed up and my second drink also made it. (Btw it wasn&#39;t what I ordered). The waitress was nice and didn&#39;t try to sell us any BS making excuses on her behalf. So I have to give kudos to her for  being honest. But probably never gonna go back to the district unless I sit at the bar.

Most of us were trying out the Bloody Mary&#39;s for the Bloody Mary tour. I opted for the mimosa bar instead. The pours are generous here and one mimosa was $3 or $4 and one was plenty for me, as I can&#39;t handle too much of the bubbly. For the bloody or the bubbly, the wait person brings you either a wine glass of bubbly for the mimosa or a tall glass with ice and vodka for the bloody.

There is a table set up with a Bloody Bar and your choice of juices on the other side for the Mimosa Bar. Pretty cool concept. Some of the juices for the mimosa seemed a bit kiddie-ish, but the mango juice blend was just perfect for my tastes.

As we had a group of 5, some of the ladies ordered some apps, a scotch egg and a bacon sampler. All seemed to be well-received. 

I ordered the regular French toast, which was simply delicious. A solid choice that was very good and at a reasonable price point. I had a taste of the bacon sampler and the peppered bacon was done right. And besides, bacon. . . mmmm.

However, to support a friend, we made a cameo here, and outside of a hell of a time finding parking, it wasn&#39;t too shabby. I did the build your own Bloody Mary bar, which was fun, although I didn&#39;t want vodka after my first round, and the servers seemed very confused by this. The vegetarian biscuits and gravy were fluffy and savory, and the Marilyn certainly met the needs of my sweet tooth. Leo got some sort of hash and enjoyed it, but felt the serving was a bit small. The servers were friendly, and although it took a while for food to come for our large group, they were incredibly on top of things with keeping our water and other drinks filled to the brim.

My one sadness about the Bloody Mary bar?  No blue cheese stuffed olives. Otherwise, for a trendy brunch place, my crotchety ol&#39; self was satisfied, and I&#39;d even consider coming here again, assuming we had an easier time finding accessible parking. Service really made this place shine."

I easily made a reservation for us for a Saturday morning. 

As soon as we were seated, we were brought water and asked if we wanted anything to drink. Yes, please! Bloodies and one mimosa. The bloody bar has seasonings (celery salt, black pepper, old bay), sauces (sriracha, worschestshire, hot sauces), olives, horseradish, celery, pickles, limes, and pepperocinis. And of course, the house Bloody Mary mix. Bottomless Bloodies are $10. A single is $6. Mimosas are $3 a piece or $10 for bottomless. $15 if you want to mix n match. Whatever way you go, you&#39;ll be pleased. Generous pours of vodka and champagne. Four or five different juices for the mimosas.

Now for the food:
We started with a scotch egg (crispy, flavorful) and bacon sampler (get it!). Then three of us shared the pancakes (they let you get three different pancakes, if you ask. We had sausage, blueberry, and bacon), the French Elvis, and the morning Mac n cheese. I was most pleased with the Mac n cheese. Cheesy cavatappi topped with bacon bits and an egg (over easy, please!)

Everyone was happy with food and service. We hit a snag when one dish wasn&#39;t quite right, but the staff rectified that quickly. Four stars because I have only been once and the bench seats are not comfy (seating near front of house). I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll add a star after visiting some more."

After driving by and seeing a packed patio day and night, we thought we would brave it despite the awful reviews. 

The very caring and thoughtful owner/manager has listened to the feedback and negative reviews. He has worked to refine the service, get food paced correctly, and is providing one of the best patio dining environments in all of Denver! 


Here&#39;s what you need to know--

1) Very dog and kid friendly patio. Make sure your lil ones are friendly...

2) Bottomless Mimosas &amp; Bloodys $10 

3) Sat and Sun Brunch until 4pm

4) Bring your friends and have a good time! 

The mimosas are served in wine glasses and the juices are totally legit. Drink away! 

The Bloodys come full of vodka and the line up of mix-ins is top notch. I enjoyed several and can&#39;t wait for another session. 

We got seated on the nearly packed patio and received prompt and friendly service from Sarah. She was great. Around when we needed her, made excellent suggestions, and left us to ourselves to enjoy our afternoon libations. 

Any restaurant that delivers pink Himalayan sea salt on request is tops in my book. Next gluten free bread options are available so that&#39;s another score! 

Let&#39;s be honest here, there won&#39;t be any James Beard awards handed out, however the food was perfectly flavored, served hot, the portions were more than adequate, and the menu has plenty of variety. 

We enjoyed a bacon trio hash that was yumm-delish. Seriously indulge and be glad you did. And had the sausage omelette, which was loaded with good stuff and tasted great. Not to mention a super value and priced right for nearly any budget. 

This is the kind of place you go to hang out, drink, socialize, and spend time with your friends. The food is good and will go well with your drinks. There&#39;s plenty of beer on tap and all the top shelf mixers you could want. 

I would have to say this could be one of the very best patios in town! 


If you go and your experience isn&#39;t as good as mine, just let the manager know, I am sure any issues will be handled with grace and gratitude. 

I am big fan and am sure as time goes on The District will continue to improve and thrive!"

It took just a little bit for services to kick through but Garrette was the best server by far last night and made our visit worth while. We started off with the Bacon platter with about ten bacon strips provided, that some of them actually had whiskey !! They came with a dip of syrup, it was astonishing. The Chicken and Waffles were awesome and the macaroni and cheese were so light and creamy that it by far was the best macaroni and cheese my mouth ever experienced!

This place.. Was different. We arrived at 10:30 AM to a completely empty house. On a Saturday. Maybe this worked in our favor, because our waiter was ON IT! They give u champagne in wine glasses and you are free to fill it with the juice of your choice, and our waiter brought that champagne bottle around enough to get us very &#34;happy&#34; lol. The mango juice was great with the champagne, my favorite! Some of the other choices tasted exactly like kool aid, which could be good or bad!!
The food was decent, I got the district Benedict (see pics plz). I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting much because really we came for drinks and I read other reviews so I knew what to expect. I actually really liked the duck bacon and the presentation was great. You even get fruit, which isn&#39;t mentioned on the menu. The biscuit however was hard and not good. So, mediocre in the end.

The Pros:
- Great service and great bartenders.
- You can get a pitcher of cocktails like the Moscow Mule. Woohoo!
- The bacon appetizer, which includes 3 different kinds of bacon. Yummm.

The Cons:
- Not particularly impressed by the gravy fries. BSide&#39;s next door are better.
- The &#34;jalapeno and cheddar&#34; croquettes taste just like potatoes and not like jalapeno or cheddar. Bit of a disappointment.

They have a great bacon flight where you can taste different kinds of bacon including lamp, duck, vanilla, and maple.  They also have an amazing steak option at dinner time that is topped with smoked blue cheese and served over risotta and roasted beets.  This is my favorite!   

We had brunch here the other day which was not as impressive.  The breakfast burritos were pretty dry.  No one likes a breakfast burrito that isn&#39;t smothered!  The green chile was also more of a salsa.  Colorado does pretty well with their green chile but this didn&#39;t fit the normal description.  They DO have an amazing all you can drink mimosa and bloody bar.  You can make your own bloody and there are at least 4 different juice options for your mimosas. 

This place however, only gets three stars because we had such a bad customer service experience on the last visit. The staff had attitude the entire time, we waited on food and drink forever, and I even wrote an email to the owner afterwards and didn&#39;t even get so much as an apology or response back. 

Being in the service industry for 13 years, I know the importance of customer service and is a bummer that this place cant even its delicious tasting dinner out with its service.  That is half the experience! :( They would have a solid five it looks like if they could have some consistancy in the service they provide and the food they serve.  It is kind of spotty."

Tuesday also happens to be half off wine- so basically it&#39;s like an awesome outdoor Netflix experience with a full bar and menu and you don&#39;t have to get up and serve yourself. Because it starts at 9 I didn&#39;t want a full meal (just a full bottle of wine)- but my friend got the poached pear salad with mahi mahi and said it was good. I got the fries with blue cheese, bacon and sauces- which were amazing and perfect for a movie night. We got a decently priced (and then half off) bottle of red wine with our meal, and they had free popcorn available as well.  Towards the end of the meal we got a delicious cheesecake to split which uniquely came in a mason jar glass.  Can&#39;t wait for the next movie night, and I will definitely be back to explore the menu some more!"

Had some family members in from out-of-town, so we decided to give it a go.  It was a mistake.  Went for late brunch on Saturday, 9/19/15.  Party of 8.

For starters the waitress was unpleasant, bordering on surly, at least until she decided to try to be nice for tip purposes.  She was anything but attentive.  In fact, it was obvious she wanted to be somewhere else.  We should have been.  It took awhile to get our drinks (no crazy concoctions!), and another 30-something minutes to get our food ... And they were not busy!  10 more minutes and 3 requests to get napkins &amp; silverware.  One in our party asked for butter to go with her biscuit.  That took another 10 minutes, and requests to 3 staffers.  So, basically it to between 50 minutes &amp; an hour to have everything we needed on the table.  Unbelievable.

And the food.  Kind of a downer.  Various forms of &#34;hash&#34; (not the smokable kind!) were ordered by some of the group ... Veggie, Pastrami &amp; some other kind.  All were disappointing.  Portions were small, and incredibly salty.  The green chili that came with it would have been good if it had half as much salt.  The &#34;breakfast corndogs&#34; that some of our group ordered were way overcooked.  Crackly, crunchy corn meal.  Not what they had in mind.  The 1 omelette at our table wasn&#39;t too bad, except for the insane amounts of salt.

The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 ... The dessert someone ordered.  Some &#34;cigar&#34; sundae thing.  Basically 2 bananas with chocolate coating in a small bowl of ice cream.  Pretty hard to screw that up.

There are so many better choices within a block or 2 on this stretch of East 17th Avenue.  Why would you even bother with this place?"

The drinks are great, and many servers know they&#39;re why you&#39;re at the restaurant, however.... the food is bland, boring, and just sucks. I&#39;ve had it all, biscuits and gravy, mac and cheese, breakfast burrito, breakfast tacos, etc. Aside from the mac and cheese, everything is terrible. I took this place for what it was, bad food, nice waiters, and lots to drink. That all changed when we had a terribly rude bartender come to refill our drinks and pretty much treat us like scum.

While the restaurant was able to accommodate my party of 8, the food was very disappointing. I ordered the butternut squash risotto and it came covered in a layer of oil. The squash wasn&#39;t cooked adequately at all and the dish lacked any seasoning. A couple of other women in my group ordered the same dish and came to the same conclusion. 

While the server was able to take care of our group and split our check just fine, every time he waited on us he sounded like a used car salesman trying to upgrade us on some special or addition to the meals."

Everyone ordered the bottomless mimosas and I will say I liked the concept of choosing your own mixer at a juice station they set up; side note they were prompt at refilling the champagne. Our server was friendly as well even though service was a bit slow. 

Why two stars? The food. I (and a few others) had chicken and waffles, which is a favorite of mine. The whole point of chicken and waffles is a balance of sweet and savory. The district really missed the mark. The waffles were okay (could have been sweeter) but the chicken wasn&#39;t what I expected. It was nugget like pieces, almost seemed like boneless skinless chicken breast cut in small hunks. No texture, no saltiness or much flavor at all. 

There was also a chipolte butter which overwhelmed the entire dish and was more smokey that savory. I even had to use some of my friends syrup and some Franks hot sauce to give the dish some flavor. No one else was really blown away by their food no matter what they ordered. The biggest complaint was lack of seasoning/flavor.

The decor is modern rustic and on the patio there are rusted seats to add to the ambiance. I was here with a decent sized group in the bar area. The waitress came by once to refill 1 persons cup of water and walked away without asking the new people if they would like to order anything. The second time she came was to give someone their check and I jumped at the chance of asking for a cup of water. Luckily she came back pretty quick,but did not see her for the rest of the time. No water refills, no orders taken. We had to go up to the bar to order food and even then it was very unorganized. I think the guy helping was just the bartender and didn&#39;t really know the menu at all. I&#39;m not sure if this time is suppose to be their down time?? there was no one helping with taking orders at all. I did read a couple reviews of poor service here, so I guess it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. One woman ordered a Chardonnay thinking it was part of the happy hour wine list, but no one mentioned to her it wasn&#39;t. She was expecting it to be $5, but was charged $9 because it wasn&#39;t the wine for happy hour. I know as customers we shouldn&#39;t assume anything, but some times we just need a little guidance with ordering the correct item we want. 

Anyway, I would&#39;ve given this place 2 stars, but added a star because of their food. I had the taco of the day (pork) $2, Mexi fries $3 and buffalo wings $4 (4 pieces). The taco was really, really tasty. It was very tender pork with just the right amount of dressings on it. Definitely a fan of that. The mexi fries were pretty good with the chipotle cream, it has a little spice to it with the fried jalapenos. The wings weren&#39;t bad either, normal traditional wings. No one really came by to check on us, we had to quickly grab one of them when they were dropping off a check or something.  I think I will come back, but will be sitting at the bar where I hope to get better service."

This is one of those places that is great in theory  with house cured meats  and  a somewhat creative menu, but just doesn&#39;t deliver . We went here with some friends as an alternate to Vine Street for an early dinner on New Years Eve. Service was decent. Majority of us got burgers. $7 for the basic burger dollar - fifty for a piece of cheese. They were pushing the bacon big time ,  but I couldn&#39;t pay $2 up charge. For a $9 burger it was mediocre at best. Again as it was not our first choice I can&#39;t fault them too much, but would expect more from an eclectic menu.  Solid draft list.

Our server must&#39;ve been having a rough day. It took more than 10 minutes after we were seated to be given menus and drink orders taken. When he brought over my coffee, there were grounds floating at the top. He noticed them, brought them to my attention by saying &#34;sorry about the grounds in there, I don&#39;t know what happened,&#34; and LEFT IT FOR ME TO DRINK. I had to ask for another cup.

When we received our breakfast orders, the four adult entrees came out, but not my daughter&#39;s Mac &#39;n Cheese kids&#39; plate. The server had forgotten to put it into the computer. While it did come out within 10 minutes or so, I did have to ask that the included milk be brought out, as well as the french fries or breakfast potatoes.

After that, the manager (or someone relatively in charge) came over and apologized for the mishaps and let us know that the kids&#39; meal and the sausage appetizer we had were being taken off the bill. Our server also was trying his best for some service recovery at this point, making sure our waters, coffees, and iced teas were filled.

The food was good: two smothered breakfast burritos, eggs Benedict, and a bread pudding/french toast dish drenched in chocolate and liquor.

Overall, because of the food, I&#39;d like to give this place a second chance. However, because of the service, I&#39;d think twice about checking out someplace new over coming back here."

I changed my order. About 2 mins later the other 4 entrees for the table arrived. I don&#39;t understand how they prepared all the other entrees and then decided they were out of salmon. 

The manager and server were apologetic, but the entire experience was just strange. Food was nothing special and certainly not worth all the drama and navigating a menu of things they probably don&#39;t have

The inside furniture did look like it was high quality. The outdoors furniture, on the other hand was downright uncomfortable. I guess they&#39;re going for a rustic look, but the cheap metal patio furniture was off putting. My chair was wobbly, and the weird arm rest things dug into my sides. Yuck. 

We ordered our food, and waited nearly 40 minutes to receive it. While I&#39;d have loved to have a leisurely two hour lunch, I was on my lunch break, so it wasn&#39;t an option. This place definitely isn&#39;t an option for an hour break from work. 

We started with the tri-bacon plate appetizer. The three different types of bacon were cool, and I was pleased to find that the sriracha bacon wasn&#39;t too spicy, but I though all of the bacon was a little under cooked. The two pork bacons were crispy and delicious on one side, but a bit gooey on the underside. The duck bacon was downright flaccid. 

For main dishes, I had the beef on weck, and Jon had the grilled cheese. Both were good, not great. Portion size was ample, but neither the flavor or texture were really remarkable. The salad was pretty standard, blue cheese dressing was something from a high quality bottle. Nothing special.

Overall, I&#39;d love to say I&#39;d come back, another lunch spot within walking distance of work would be highly welcome, but it&#39;s just not doable on a lunch break."

The service we received wasn&#39;t particularly attentive or quick, our water glass was refilled once, then left empty. We were never asked if we wanted another glass of wine or beer. Maybe it was because we were the only ones under 60 in the whole place? I don&#39;t know. Only half the restaurant was occupied and it wasn&#39;t busy.

The bread was probably the best thing I ate here.

Our food was okay, my fiancé enjoyed the gnocchi he ordered, but my pappardelle alla Veneziana was just okay - the seafood did not seem very fresh: the mussels were small and very stringy, and one of the clams tasted off enough that I ended up spitting it out out of fear of food poisoning. We weren&#39;t offered fresh Parmesan or anything, either. As others have mentioned, the food was on the saltier side. Our waiter seemed attentive to the other tables around us but not particularly excited to serve us - he didn&#39;t give us his name.

For dessert I ordered the panna cotta which was okay, if a bit heavy on the gelatin (read: very firm). I was charged a dollar more for my glass of wine than was stated on the iPad drink list, but felt it petty to point it out.

This place is better than the Olive Garden and it sits across the street from multimillion dollar houses, which I guess is how it stays open. With the service being what it was and the food being decidedly average, I wouldn&#39;t return."

Our server said they are known for their veal, and pastas are fresh and housemade. This review is for a dinner about a month ago. 

INSALATE CESARE - $6.95
Romaine lettuce, homemade croutons, cherry tomatoes, shaved parmesan cheese and homemade Caesar dressing. Very good esp. the dressing. 

PENNE ALLA SORRENTINA - $16.95
Penne pasta tossed in fresh tomato sauce w/ roasted garlic, basil and fresh mozzarella. Also very good, noodles al dente, portion enough for two meals. 

I&#39;d definitely come back. My co-workers ordered the veal and they all enjoyed it - I&#39;ll order that next time. Also enjoyed the complimentary Italian bread with really good EVOO - however the olive bread was a little too salty for me. Good dessert selection too - all $7 ... but we were too full :)"

It was packed on a Tuesday night and that tells you something. My friends and I didn&#39;t think we would need to make any reservations but this is apparently a very popular place. Instead of turning us away, the hostess managed to find us a seat and even offered us wine when we were waiting. The service here is definitely great. They are very attentive and even made bets on what nationality my friend was haha. 

Now let&#39;s talk about the food because that&#39;s why i am giving 5 stars. The wine selection is huge and their riesling is just delicious! For starters we got bread with the typical olive oil and vinigrette. The pasta here is just heavenly and probably one of the best pastas i&#39;ve had. I decided to venture out of my usual order and tried the chicken marsala pasta. There was so much food and it was really good! Not too heavy and perfectly el dente and lots of big chicken pieces. My friend got the pesto pasta and that was phenomenal as well. 

At the end, they also gave me a small tiramisu dessert for my birthday and it was so sweet of them. That cake was amazing. I would definitely come back!"

+Unlimited soft, warm bread 
+Lots of vegetarian options - almost any dish can be made vegetarian 
+The pesto was delicious - heavy, but extremely tasty with the gnocchi, which was cooked just right 
+Reasonable prices for quantity, quality and service 

Cons:
-Some pasta was a little too heavy, but to be expected of eating tonss of pasta
-butternut squash ravioli was overcooked 

Tips:
+Make reservations - it gets very busy in the evenings! 
+Ask the waiter for recs - they know their stuff

I understand this is owned by the same owner as Venice (solid restaurant also).  Any of the dishes I&#39;ve tried have been great!  Tomato mozzarella salad is a typical mozz salad (minus the mess of making &amp; cleaning up the mess) and I&#39;ll pour a little balsamic on top.  
I&#39;m a big fan of friendly people and friendly people who works at restaurants and everyone who works here is always very nice every time I&#39;m there or call.
All pasta/entree dishes are great! When I feel like indulging, I hate to admit, I like the chicken pasta with Gorgonzola sauce! Very rich and creamy!  Great restaurant all around.  Take note that the location does have limited seating compared to their Venice location."

I found it on yelp when staying near the DTC. The decor is simple, yet sweet with white table cloths, candles, and walls painted with the Tuscan countryside. 

The waitstaff was friendly and our water glasses were never once empty. 

The drink menu is on an iPad which is good because the lighting is a little dark in there. They had a decent, yet not extensive, array of wines to choose from &amp; 3 different beers. (Two Italian variety  &amp; Coors Light). If you want a bottle of wine, be prepared to shell out at least $40. 

The menu was fantastic. The daily specials were a little tough to read with the graphic they placed underneath, but the content and choices were to die for. A lot of the menu contained dishes with house made fresh pasta. Yum! At our table we shared a pear salad to begin with which was mixed field greens, Gorgonzola crumbles, pecans, cucumber and of course, pears. It was beautifully presented! The entrees consisted of thick, flat pasta with an amazing red cream sauce and prawns for one and corkscrew pasta with mushrooms and chicken for the other. Both were incredible! Our only complaint was that when we asked our waiter if the portion sizes were large enough to share, he said no. Well, I couldn&#39;t even come close to eating half of my dish. 

Chianti, you&#39;ve stolen my heart. We will be back!"

This restaurant is a huge let down- I am SO disappointed and will not be back along with 7 of my friends. My friend made a reservation for 8 at 745pm last Saturday. We got there at 745 and the table wasn&#39;t ready so that was fine but there was no where to wait so I asked the host to take my # down and call us when it would be ready as we had to leave due to no waiting area. At 8pm they still hadn&#39;t called so we walked back in and said oh yeah you&#39;re table is now ready. We all sat down and were not approached by a waiter or waitress for 15 mins. A waitor finally came over said &#34;Hi, I&#39;ll be your waitor&#34; then WALKED away!!! I was flabbergasted at this point. We waited another 10 mins and they came back and took our drink order.  We were all ready to order food at this point so we ordered our entrees too.  Drinks came out, finished our first round of drinks in probably 20-30 mins waitor did not come back to our table until the entrees were served. (The whole time we watched our waitor circle around to 4 other tables multiple times to help customers).
I ordered a second glass of Malbec, they ran out of Malbec so I said no problem I&#39;ll have a glass of red and you can choose it...waitor said, OK no problem I&#39;ll be back. Did he come back? Nope, had to remind him after 15 mins of waiting and at this point I was almost done with my entrée. He comped my last glass of wine so I did appreciate that. 
The pros: the food was amazing!  
Atmosphere is cute and quaint and has a lot of potential."

Firstly, I value great customer service because I come from a family who once owned a restaurant of our own. Secondly, I love me some GREAT Italian food.

This place is a combination of good service, good food, and a homey, but fancy atmosphere. Two of my girlfriends and I went on a Tuesday night to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday. To our surprise, this place was jam-packed. I am a vegetarian so I usually expect to only have 1 or 2 token vegetarian options on a given menu, but to my delight, there was PLENTY to choose from.

We were offered wine while we waited for a table and the waiter adequately checked up on us (basically the right amount - water was filled at the right time, but we weren&#39;t unnecessarily nagged every 5 minutes either).

Overall, I give this place a two thumbs up. My friends birthday dessert was on the house and it was probably the yummiest, fanciest dessert plate that I&#39;ve ever seen. Definitely will be going back!"

My family and I dined here for lunch on my birthday, and needless to say, I will more than likely be returning for another visit.

I was first drawn to Chianti by the extensive number of pasta options on the menu. They have my favorite, gnocchi, in different variations: marinara, pesto, gorgonzola cream, etc. They also stick to the tried and true Italian style of dining by separating the primo pasta course from the secundo meat course.

During lunch, they offer a specialized menu that differs slightly from the general menu. The prices are the same, and you don&#39;t get any special course discounts, which was disappointing, but the prices generally are very fair. Same as Olive Garden, and you&#39;re getting much better food.

The bread was fantastic, eaten mopped up with an olive oil/balsamic vinaigrette mixture. My mom and I shared a pear salad that was as beautiful as it was tasty as well as the pesto gnocchi. My gnocchi was good, though a touch too squishy - I prefer gnocchi sauteed a bit, to give it a firmer exterior.

We sadly did not get to try the dessert options as we were too full, but next time, Chianti! Next time.

The servers were courteous, though I felt a hint of disdain in the way one man responded when we refused dessert and asked for our bill. Not sure if this was just my perception or if they were actually projecting a bit of snobbery? Some of the servers could also work a bit on their diction, as we had trouble understanding them. (One guy talked so fast and mumbly that we had absolutely no idea what he was saying.) The busboy did a fantastic job of ensuring our glasses were filled and clearing the table promptly.

The restaurant itself is also clean and well maintained, with a large wine rack and a picturesque Italian country-side mural that runs the length of the restaurant. It did remind me of a few of the restaurants in which I dined in Rome.

All in all, a pretty fantastic restaurant, and one of the better Italian places I&#39;ve tried in Denver."

We ordered off the restaurant week as my boyfriend and I were visiting this place for the first time.  We had the artichoke with cheese on grilled bread-- amazing!! The soup of the day was butternut squash soup that was so delish that I wiped up every last drop with the complimentary rustic bread.  My pasta for the veal scallopine was also great (they know how to make a great pasta sauce) but the carne was ok.  The tiramisu and lasagna bolognese was the bomb!

We were both in mood for Italian food and found this restaurant that was highly reviewed and looked to be a nice little place with quality food. 

The atmosphere was nice and the dining room was inviting definitely reminded me of a true Italian restaurant. 

We were able to call in a reservation for that night late in evening and we were seated immediately. We ordered bruschetta to start and it was fresh and delicious. I ordered the Shrimp Alfredo and it was amazing, honestly one of the better Alfredo sauces I&#39;ve had and the shrimp was fresh and cooked perfect. My girlfriend ordered a chicken dish that came with a side of angel hair pasta and she was very happy with everything.

The salads were okay, no complaints. We ordered a half portion of the lobster ravioli as an appetizer and the bisque topping was eerily similar to Campbell&#39;s tomato soup. Way too similar. Two of our party ordered the halibut special and said the fish was rubbery and not good. Two more ordered gnocchi that was crumbly and not firm. I had spaghetti al pomodoro and the sauce was so hot (temp). It didn&#39;t taste fresh and was starting to separate the longer I waited to let it cool. They said the noodles were homemade but I seriously doubt my order of spaghetti was homemade. 

We are an Italian family and my grandma makes a lot of the items we ordered so we were expecting authentic and homemade. Needless to say, we passed on dessert which was probably a safe bet."

And then insisted on telling us about the wines instead of bringing a wine list. We had our young kids with us, I don&#39;t know if that had anything to do with it, but we felt rushed the entire time.

They have some fish and seafood selections, which I don&#39;t eat but they look good.  The pastas, chicken and veal dishes are all amazing.  My favorite is the stuffed chicken breast marsala.  It comes with a side of pasta or potatos and perfectly steamed vegetables. And I highly recommend the gnocchi. They also have a great wine selection. 
The service is always very professional and attentive - the only &#34;not so great&#34; experience with that was when I felt rushed on Valentine&#39;s Day.

I found the restaurant very nice with white linens, clean, and well decorated to feel like you&#39;re treating yourself to something special.

Menu items are on the pricier side, but you can get something wonderful for less than $15. I ordered the gnocchi with Gorgonzola cream sauce, walnuts and grilled pear. It was decedent! Very rich, the gnocchi were obviously homemade, and enough walnuts and pears for every bite. I couldn&#39;t even finish it, it was such a generous portion.

Service was good, if a little pushy on the wine and dessert menu. The menu was large with lots of options, and definitely left me wanting to come back and try a few more items.

I&#39;m a very seasonal eater, so this is more &#34;winter&#34; food for me- comfort food to the max! I will likely be back to check out more of their offerings, and would even consider this place for a more upscale, yet still casual, date night."

My sisters, my mom, and I went to Chianti the day after Christmas for a quiet, catch-up meal.  My sister had been there and recommended it.  I read the reviews beforehand but it exceeded my expectations.

Located at a strip mall, it is very unpretentious.  We arrived before the restaurant officially opened but the hostess warmly greeted and seated us.  The waiter promptly arrived at our table and welcomed us.  He continued to check on us throughout the evening but without intruding. He ensured that that our wine and water glasses were filled.

The meal!  We highly recommend the calamari with fried zucchini and the Melanzane Alla Parmigiana (Eggplant​ layered with fresh mozzarella, marinara sauce and fresh basil).  We devoured both.  Although the bread is delicious, as our waiter warned us, don&#39;t fill up on it.  I filled up on it more than I should because I was not able to finish my meal.  I ordered the Taguatelle Alle Gamberoni (flag egg pasta with shrimp) and enjoyed it. But since I was full and couldn&#39;t finish it, I asked for a to-go box and even took it back to L.A. with me!  My sister had a duck dish with truffle oil and my mom and two sisters had Cioppino, a stew that had a variety of seafood including shrimp, calamari, and clams.  I tried it and kinda wish I got it, too.  We ended the evening with a hazelnut crepe and vanilla and pistachio gelato.

I highly recommend this place. It is very low-key but the food, service, and ambiance are spectacular.  The space is cozy but it doesn&#39;t feel crowded; it just feels like you are with other locals/neighbors.  

I can&#39;t remember the last time I enjoyed my dining experience this much."

Previous reviews are not lying when they said that this place is hidden, but it is much nicer inside than one would expect in a strip mall.  Please also ignore yelp categorizing this as casual - while it is not suit and tie we saw another couple who looked very out of place wearing a hat and work out clothes.  The staff did also ask him to remove his hat so this restaurant is definitely not casual.  

The food was delicious but I just wanted to take a mention the great service.  Our server was Luigi and when he found out it was my birthday he made sure our night was special.  He gave us complimentary dessert and dessert wine, and even got my boyfriend to sing Happy Birthday at the table.  He was extremely personable and we would definitely request to have him as our server on our next visit.  

Make the drive to Greenwood Village and give Chianti a try!  But make sure to make a reservation - there are not many tables to be had."

My niece ordered some lobster dish. The waiter pointed out that this particular dish has a little more sea food-y taste than most lobster dishes. She changed her order and LOVED it.

If you are planning to have dinner there at popular hours, the service will be very slow and very inconsistent. We saw our waiter may be four times during the whole dinner and the rest of the time the bussers were the ones who took care of us.

For our main meal we ordered Ravioli Di Gamberi, Spaghetti carbonara and both meals were extremely salty. I know some sea salt helps to bring out the flavors but in this case, the salt was all that we could taste. SALT, SALT and MORE SALT.

For desert we ordered the Molten Cake which was very dry and not what we expected. Overall we were disappointed and we will not go back."

One of the daily specials was a salad with pears and gorganzola.  I asked and was able to add a grilled chicken breast to it.  Turned out to be the perfect lunch - delicious and just the right size.  It was so good, I wasn&#39;t even envious of my fellow diners&#39; pasta dishes.

The restaurant was lovely.  It definitely had more of an upscale feel to it than I expected for being in a strip mall.  And, I adored our server - an older gentleman with a thick Italian accent.  He even had a system for dealing with all of us and our separate checks that turned out well and got us out in a surprisingly timely manner.  The only thing that stopped it from being 5 star is that it was a bit on the pricey side for lunch.  Not too bad, but with tip my salad and chicken set me back around $14."

A chicken breast w &#34;marinara&#34; sauce, a tablespoon of cut up tomatoes, two small dollops of mozzarella cheese and some fresh parmigiana put on by the waiter for $20: The other 3 dishes we had at our table were very underwhelming: thick, salty, &amp; heavily spiced dishes.

This is why the guy walked away with a $600 tip that evening!  I tried the sausage gnocchi which was phenomenal!

The ambiance: After entering the restaurant, you quickly forget that the front of the building is mostly uninviting concrete. There are Tuscan villas painted on the walls, and the tables are covered with crisp white tablecloths and sparkling glasses waiting to be filled with wine. 

The food: Pear Salad, Onion Soup, Butternut Squash Ravioli and Polletto ai Carciofi e Capperi (Chicken with Grilled Artichokes) were divine. The side of Fettuccine Alfredo that came with the chicken had a unique nutty flavor and was a favorite element of the meal. We finished the evening by sharing the bread pudding as it was a more unique item to see at an Italian restaurant and were not disappointed.

Wine selection is generous, and the prices were fair. 

I would strongly recommend making reservations. We were in at around 5:30 on a Saturday night, and the tables were completely full before 6:00.

My wife and I came here last week and were lucky to walk in because it was early (5:45ish).  While we ate dinner we saw probably half a dozen other parties get turned away because the place was booked.  

I thought the food was really good - my wife was underwhelmed.  I think she was more turned off by the service and cramped seating though.  If nothing else, you can definitely tell that everything is handmade and fresh.  The pastas and gnocchis were subpurb in my opinion.  The calamari appetizer left a lot to be desired."

I would have seen it by now.&#34;  Turns out it&#39;s on the other (south) side of Belleview from the King Soopers shopping plaza where I frequently lunch.  Who knew?

I&#39;ve been here three times now and have not been disappointed.  The menu is relatively expansive with different varieties of gnocchi, interesting ravioli (including duck, crab, and pumpkin varieties, not all in one thankfully), pasta dishes and main courses.  The vegetarian options are somewhat sparse, but they&#39;re there.  My favorite entree thus far has been a fried eggplant pasta with mozzarella but it wasn&#39;t on the menu during my last visit.  However, there is an eggplant appetizer (layers of eggplant and sauce topped with cheese) that&#39;s less than entree sized but perfectly pairable with soup or salad.

Prices are in line given the quality of food - about $10-18 for a pasta dish (dependent on the ingredients) and more for a main course.  The service is shockingly speedy, especially given the restaurant style and ambience.  I think it was one of our only DTC lunch club locations where lunch managed to fit within an hour and my recent visit with coworkers was very much the same.  On top of that, you still get the &#34;fanciness&#34; of starting with fresh baked bread and olive oil and having the pepper guy come and grind pepper over your meal.  They were also incredibly efficient in splitting checks for our large Yelp group, which was much appreciated.

Chianti is very easy to overlook but worth a visit if you&#39;re down south and craving a slightly nicer Italian food experience."

Nice wine list too - and the ipad wine menu is fun (though it would be better if it included wine ratings).  Unfortunately the food, while employing high quality and fresh ingredients, has little to do with authentic Italian cuisine.  Chianti is the Italian equivalent of Chinese restaurants that serve &#34;Chinese-American&#34; brown gravy dishes instead of the real thing.

Ravioli with sausage featured fresh pasta with tasty sausage.  However the thick, gloppy orange sauce was an unfortunate distraction.  

Gnocchi al pesto was smothered in a creamy smooth green sauce (looked like green goddess dressing!).  Instead of a simple, delicious pesto, with identifiable ingredients (visible basil or other green, pine nuts, olive oil, parmesan) this food-processed sauce was full of what seemed like gorgonzola cheese.  It was ridiculously heavy.

Veal pizzaiola was a mess of thick brownish sauce and overly salty olives covering overcooked sliced veal.  

Bottom line: heavy, otherwise forgettable food with nice wine in pleasant surroundings. This isn&#39;t enough to make me return."

I came here with a group of Yelpers. 
I got there early and was surprised to see only 1 other table with customers. And it was high noon.

I indicated that the 6 of us would be needing separate checks and the waiter (who reminded me of the cutest grandpa ever) said he would try in a very thick italian accent. Hmmm...  never a good sigh (although it did turn out ok)

I was in the mood for eggplant parm. I looked the menu all over - hard to find what part is what (just like italy - ugh). Turned out the only eggplant parm was an appetizer. I mentioned i really wanted eggplant parm and could i get a bigger portion than the appetizer.
That seemed to confuse him and he said i could get 2 appetizer portions and pay for that. Hmmm....

So i did a quick pick of the seafood ravioli  and was totally disappointed. The flavor was anh, sauce was ok - but upset my tummy later. 

The turn around was pretty good, we were done in under an hour - which never happens for this lunch group! Woot!

They were also a little cranky that the final bills were all paid with credit cards... seriously - everyone had a meal over $10... 

Anyway - i had a fabulous dinner here back in the day, which is the only reason for the 3rd star, otherwise i would have gone with 2.

Basically come for a romantic dinner, pay as 1 check and order wine (they like you better then, too!)"

It was a tie between Chianti and Thai Lotus (both in the same shopping center), and when we went to go look at Chianti&#39;s menu, we saw they didn&#39;t open till 5pm, and it was 10 till.

Not a worry, as the gentleman who turned out to be our waiter saw us walking away, he came out and told us they&#39;d be happy to seat us early if we were hungry (which we were). I checked out the menu, and they had multiple gnocchi dishes (my favorite food ever), so we got a table.

The food? Ridiculously amazing. I had the Gnocchi Gorgonzola with Roasted Pear, and Leo enjoyed some Rigatoni with a tomato cream sauce, sausage and peas. Both were to die for - so good, in fact, that my Italian New Yorker of a partner said that Chainti&#39;s gave Umberto&#39;s (our favorite Italian place on Long Island) a run for their money. Good sized portions, warm bread fresh out of the oven, and impeccable service.

Plus, Leo and Fiorenzo (our server) has a nice conversation about where in Italy they were from, Americanized pronunciation of things and names Italian, and more. Even though this place is a bit out of our way, we&#39;ll definitely be back, again and again. Best Italian food we&#39;ve had on this side of the Mississippi, hands down."

It&#39;s a small restaurant, tucked away in a strip mall with maybe 20 tables.  The ambiance was very Italian with one wall being a wine rack and the other walls being painted with scenes of Italy.  There was Italian music playing that seemed to vary widely in volume, from quiet to overpowering.  

It was lunch and the place was empty, just our table of seven and three other tables of two.  The wait staff was very prompt with the one exception of keeping my ice tea glass full."

The restaurant was packed and small with no waiting area and the hostess station was crowded with other patrons waiting to be seated. 

Twenty minutes later, after having to stand outside to wait, we decided to leave and go elsewhere. During the wait we received no update regarding the possibility of being seated, meanwhile the hostess had no trouble yucking it up with other patrons. So much for having a reservation. 

This was extremely disappointing and poorly handled. I suggest Chianti rethink their reservation policy since it doesn&#39;t seem to matter if you have one. To top it off, I was sent an email to let me know the restaurant canceled my reservation after we left. Laughable. With that said, I cannot comment on the food."

It probably some of the best Italian food you can get in the Denver area. The pasta is fresh, hand made and it&#39;s delicious. The Chianti antipasto was also impressive.  The calamari was fried perfectly and was light, crunchy and not greasy at all. I always judge italian places by their calmari. If they can&#39;t do that right then fahgettaboudit.

One thing to know about this place is its SMALL. There are a limited number of tables so it&#39;s probably best to make reservations. 

I laughed when another reviewer here said they could get better food at Olive Garden. If you think Olive Garden is good, do Yelp a favor and please don&#39;t post anymore reviews. Your opinion is not needed."

The good about Chianti&#39;s is the authentic Italian cuisine. I had the Italian sausage ravioli and the nutella crepes for dessert. The food was fresh, well made and delish!! The raviolis were large and the sauce was chunky goodness filled with lots of veggies and sausage. The dessert was fall off my chair sweet , but anything with nutella is a winner in my book! Honestly, the food was 5 stars. 

The bad about Chianti&#39;s is the service, I am sorry to say, lacked. We came in during a snow storm and the place was half full yet they asked for a reservation - which thanks to the hubby we had. Still I got the feeling we would have been left waiting w/o it - even with 1/2 the tables empty. Then there was the general slooooooow service. Slow to take drink orders, slow to bring bread, didn&#39;t ask if we wanted a second drink, etc... Plus there was the attitude we got about not ordering wine. We just aren&#39;t wine drinkers and they left the wine list and asked a couple times if we were going to order it - the answer &#34;no&#34; seemed to get us some stern looks, as did us saying we were sharing dessert. It was just an uncomfortable vibe in there. 

I loved the food and didn&#39;t care for the rest of the experience; hence the 3 stars."

My family went here to celebrate my grandmother&#39;s 86th birthday and she loved it! My sister, the queen of gluten and dairy free, even had a good time and was able to eat a real meal. They had gluten free pasta for her and gluten free sauce and to top it off, our server&#39;s sister was allergic to gluten as well so he really understood the severity of a gluten allergy. I loved the wine list, it was really extensive, all Italian, and was presented on an iPad, for added coolness! I got the parpadelle and was very pleased with it, everything was so packed with flavor, even the pasta! My grandmother is a huge shrimp fan so she got the shrimp scampi for her birthday meal and really enjoyed it. We got some decadent banana bread pudding for the table, what a perfect and delicious dessert! The service at Chianti was very impressive, everything was executed efficiently and with extreme warmth and hospitality. I would definitely recommend Chianti to anyone looking for some authentic Italian food in a cozy, no fuss setting. I was extremely impressed with everything and will certainly be back!"

The service is friendly, the prices are reasonable, the selection is vast but not overwhelming, the portions are just the right size, and the food is outstanding. 

The only drawback to this place is that space is limited and it feels a bit cramped. Every time I have made a reservation, however, a table has been waiting for me (not like some places where it just puts you up to the front of the line, but you still have to wait to be seated).  The food itself is worth dealing with the cramped space.

I&#39;d also recommend leaving your kids with a babysitter."

We came in on a snowy night about 6pm and there was only 1 or 2 tables that already had people at them. The rest of the place was deserted, yet we were asked if we had reservations and we both got the definite impression that if we didn&#39;t, we&#39;d have been told to wait.

We were seated, given water, then it felt like forever before the waiter came back to see if we wanted anything to drink. Neither of us are wine drinkers so we got some vodka. He brought the drinks out pretty quick and then wandered off. A few minutes later the bread finally came out and maybe 10 after that they finally came back and took our orders. We both got the ravioli with sausage (which was spectacular) and the food itself came out pretty quick.

Shortly after the food came out the waiter came back and asked if we wanted wine NOW. Since we were still drinking our vodka&#39;s we obviously said no. He left in a huff and finally took the wine menu off the table.

A few minutes later we both finished our first drink and were NEVER asked if we wanted another one. Luckily we had water on the table.

After we were finished with our meals we waited a good 10 minutes before they came to clear the plates away and gave us desert menus. We ordered desert and, again, it came out quick and was awesome.

After we finished the desert I swear it was another 15 minutes before he came back and finally gave us our ticket. Maybe if we&#39;d been nursing drinks we wouldn&#39;t have noticed it so much, but since all we had at that point was water it was a little annoying."

I don&#39;t know how they are passing the fire code inspections with the table setup they have. There are no clear paths between tables, and when the place is full (as it seems to always be because the food is great!) it can be a game of hopscotch to find your way to the front door. If you are able, request a table on the outside perimeter, and you won&#39;t be jostled by everyone trying to leave after their meal.

I visited the lady&#39;s room during our meal, and was quite embarrassed to find the toilet would not flush. I notified our server (and the woman waiting next in line, who immediately went into the men&#39;s room instead) and was told that happens frequently! WHAT??!! Get it fixed already! Also, you must pass the server work station to get to the restrooms. A little awkward.The whole restroom debacle caused one more star downgrade.

This restaurants sits in a strip mall at the corner of Belleview and Yosemite. Easy to get to, but the parking lot fills up quickly.

I would definitely try this place again, but would make sure to request a perimeter table, and avoid using the restroom."

This is a smaller place with great service, tucked in a strip mall in the burbs.  The service feels like an old-time Italian place, while the colors are brighter.  Service was very quick and the sausage ravioli was fantastic with plenty of extra sausage and whole roasted garlic cloves.  The sausage had just the right amount of kick and fennel, the sauce was a fantastic cream-based sauce, and the raviolis fresh.

I couldn&#39;t decide what to eat but ended up ordering the gnocchi.  Glad I did!  It was delicious and I even had some left over for lunch the next day (score).  

Service was good and I would definitely come back for lunch, possibly even try it for dinner sometime to see what their wine selection is like (i&#39;ll admit I didn&#39;t even look at their wine list).

I would think that for dinner you could come casual or more dressy and be just fine either way.  It has a small family type of feel to it."

Fiorenzo, our waiter is the real deal and the language rolled beautifully off his tongue which added to the authenticity of the entire experience.  We almost felt like we had been transported to a little cafe in Italy.

The Insalata Panzanella was amazing all the ingredient were fresh, bright and full of flavor.  My wife&#39;s Scalopinne ai Carciofini was fork tender, rich and zesty.  The ribbon pasta in my Pappardelle alla Busara entree was hand made and went beautifully with the savory cream sauce and shrimp.

Chianti is small so reservations are a must.  We made ours on www.Opentable.com.  Check out the restaurant&#39;s website at http://chiantiristoranteitaliano.com/ and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did."

Although the tables are too close this is a common problem in small restaurants. One suggestion or warning.  The bruschetta is devoid of any flavor. It was a gooey mess of not fresh tomatoes with soggy toast.  For an Italian restaurant this has to be a basic appetizer.  Next time I will not waste the money as it was barely edible.

The food the second time was ok. Honestly I felt like the more I ate it, the saltier it became.

Food- one of the best Italian meals I have ever had
Ambiance- as many have mentioned, this restaurant is almost out of place. Next to a salon in a tiny strip mall, you enter and forget you are not in Italy as the decor is very authentic 

Negatives:
Service- was a bit slow and we were neglected at some parts of the evening

Experience:
I was in Denver for business and found Chianti on Yelp. I was not disappointed. This was one of the top Italian meals I have ever had and I have spent time in Italy. You could tell everything was handmade, fresh, and truly authentic. I got a ravioli dish that was the perfect combination of sweet, salty and rich. My only criticism is that the service was strange. After making a reservation, we were seated right when we walked in and our drink orders were taken but we were not given food menus until we specifically asked for them when our waiter came back ten minutes later.. So we were just sitting there waiting and unable to begin looking at food options.

Although this place is intimate, there were a couple parties of business people here, so I do not think you would feel out of place going with friends/alone if you did not have a date or romantic occasion. I really cannot speak highly enough of the food. If I ever find myself in Denver again, this will be the first place I come."

It was a very Italian meal, extremely well done with everything being exceptional.  We ordered the caprisi salad, gnochetti with sausage and mushrooms appetizers.  The gnochetti sauces was so good that our table cleaned the plate with the wonderful breads.

For entrees, we ordered the Farfalle with chicken con pollo, Veal Marsala and the Veal de limone with capers. For side pastas we ordered the Fettucini along with the lobster ravioli.  The Veal was cut with a fork and no knife needed.  The fettucini was so the perfect amount of cheese and creaminess.

The location is not near anything, unless you live in the area.  It is definately worth the drive for authentic and real Italian.

Alex our server is a chatty one, telling us stories of Italy and recommended wines.  

His tip was to buy friends a new Armani suit before taking them to his favorite wine place in Italy, you&#39;ll save yourself lots of money!"

I knew it was in a mini strip mall before coming but I still had high expectations. The one and only reason I came is because the online menu had a dish that&#39;s nearly impossible to find that&#39;s my all time favorite which is the Gnocchi al Gorgonzolla e Pere. This particular dish was really good but again not quite as good as Venice. Louie was our server and he was very kind. The setting is not much of an intimate one, it&#39;s one very square room and tables are very close together. I saw a few families with kids in there which I would never see at the Lodo Venice, not saying this is a bad thing I&#39;m just giving people a heads up, this is great if you want food similar in quality to Venice Ristorante while being comfortable bringing your kids, but it could be a bad thing if your on a date and trying to avoid a kid friendly place. There was a female who wasn&#39;t our waiter but for some reason I kept noticing her because her apron was FILTHY, also a different between Chianti and Venice, waiters at Venice are always very well groomed. I can&#39;t give this place less that 4 stars because I did not have an unpleasant experience but I can&#39;t give it 5 because in a way it does seem very generic to Venice."

The free bread was good and unique. (I loved the roll that had big grains of salt on it and what I think was rosemary baked in).

I ordered the speciality of duck breast and was pleasantly surprised at how well the breast was cooked. 

I suspect that the chef made the sauce strong to counter the flavor of the duck. While this worked really well with the duck it made mopping up the sauce with bread a bit strong, unless you like vinegar and salt (Which I was 98% in the mood for).

The bill was timely and had the deserts been a bit cheaper I would have been happy to order one.

On the whole the meal was good, the price not unreasonable and there was good service. I would go back again.

$30 bucks bought a non-past special and tip. No drink, appetizer, or desert.

Bread with oil and vinegar were complimentary along with the water.

I didn&#39;t have a problem being seated but several people came in and had apparently placed reservations. While the place barely filled beyond 50%, it never hurts to consider a reservation."

I have tried a couple burritos and they are awesome, full of flavor, not fluff, they are nicely rolled and wrapped with care, not haste. There is a &#34;seasonal side&#34; that comes along with a burrito, again an item that rotates and doesn&#39;t leave the customer having to choose between a handful of arbitrary items...simplicity.

I guess I never asked more about it and they never told me anything more than that. And spontaneously I went to meet a friend there so I didn&#39;t read any Yelp reviews so it was interesting to show up and realize I was getting a fusion burrito. Ironically and coincidentally, I wanted a burrito but a typical Mexican one wasn&#39;t pulling me so I was laboring on the way there about which type I would get. 

I was pleased to see the diverse and creative menu and then the debate was which one of these do I want to try because so many were incredibly intriguing. I went with the Korean beef and I really loved it. Normally, I would never be able to take down the whole thing but I&#39;ve been training so this did the trick. There are a number of other options I&#39;d like to try in the future.

The place itself has a nice vibe and it&#39;s way different than I thought. I could really potentially come here for a beer and hang out. It&#39;s great to have the option to do either without really being in a true bar. I&#39;m definitely a fan and happy that I finally discovered this place!"

The chips and guac were SO good. The guac was especially fresh and delicious, I could have eaten that for dinner and been quite happy.
The salad was so good! It had a unique flavor, and the quinoa was a nice touch.
My friend got fish tacos and was loving every bite.

This place is fresh, fast and has a laid back casual vibe."

The choices are very unique for a burrito. I got the Thai coconut curry burrito with tofu (you can substitute any meat for tofu) and veggies. I was so overwhelmed by flavor and texture and spice and okay I&#39;m done... My three friends were very impressed too, which says a lot! They had the tofu veggie burrito, lamb burrito, and Korean BBQ ones. On top of this, our food came out super quick! We walked up, ordered, and our food came out within ten minutes.

The two high chairs that I first grabbed were literally falling apart. They were coming undone at the seams. Where the pieces of wood had once been glued and jointed together with dowels were completely split apart. It looks like if you sat in it, that it would just completely collapse. Didn&#39;t look safe to me.

Dirty tables: There were only two, 4-top tables in there, and the one that we chose to sit at was the cleaner of the two, yet still, my wife had to get napkins and go get some water from the soda fountain machine to clean off our own table because it was kind of gross.
Bathroom sink looked like it had not been cleaned in a long time, gross again. Wonder what the kitchen looks like?

Very Limited menu: you can&#39;t choose what to have on your burrito. They come with a set list of ingredients. I suppose you could ask them to leave something out, but their menu only has eight items to begin with. 

Way overpriced: $10 freakin dollars for what is in essence, a small version of a Chipotle burrito??!! At least chipotle offers you many options and their products are organic or vegan if you desire that. They are also a lot cheaper. 

Parking lot is small: when we walked in there was barely anybody in there, yet their parking lot was completely full. We had to park at a closed business next door.

After trying this trendy, flash in the pan restaurant, we will not be back.

Pros:
Tasted good. The burrito combinations are clever and tasty. 
Full bar
Draft beer
Pet friendly patio

Cons:
Way overpriced 
Very limited vegetarian options
Dirty bathrooms
Filthy high chairs
Dirty tables
Parking is a joke"

I love the variety of burritos they offer, and my favorite part as a vegetarian is you can get grilled tofu to substitute meat on any burrito free of charge. And their tofu is SO good, not flavorless little squares of nothing like some people make tofu -- this place really grills it and it&#39;s got great flavor. I like the authentic Mexican burrito they have best, #3, but if you go a little higher burritos #5-7 are great as well if you&#39;re in the mood for something a little different with an Asian twist. 

They also have a bar and corn-hole so it&#39;s got a nice chill bar vibe as well. My only complaint would be that $10 for a burrito is a little pricey, but these are very large burritos I usually save half for later which makes it worth it."

Don&#39;t like burritos... Until Scratch Burrito. The flavors are insane, the owner is very friendly, and the ambiance: vibrant but subdued. 

They obviously put a lot of thought in their menu-- they only have a handful of different burritos but they are all very unique, and the flavor palette very colorful.

They have a few side dishes too like Asian chicken wings, quesadillas... Where do I even stop. This is another neighborhood gem. Place to go when you want to have good burrito: level 200."

We had the Korean bbq one and the Thai curry. Both were so flavorful and jam-packed with ingredients. The only downfall is their side that accompanied the burrito was nothing special at all.. I think we had the coleslaw.

They seem like an afterthough, and are always fridge burned and unexceptional. Scrap the side and make the burritos cheaper! The ritos are huge, so it&#39;s not like you need a side anyway. 

There are usually some fun cocktails on the daily board, and there is a decent tap beer selection. Why not five stars? The seat yourself format seems to encourage not tipping, and the consequence is a total lack of table service."

The salads are also quite well-crafted. If you are visiting with a date, I strongly recommend getting one salad and one burrito to share; preferably with a couple nice craft beers.

My mom and I came in for some burrito goodness around noon on a Sunday. There were only about 4 other people in the place, so our food came out super fast.

I got the number 7 naked burrito which is the lamb tandoori with cucumbers and yogurt. While this was good, there was something missing from it. I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on it...so what do I do in these situations? Only one thing: drench that sucker in enough hot sauce that I could swim in. It was delicious then. Although, I think this may have been more hot sauce love on my part than burrito love.

My mom got the Korean BBQ naked burrito and holy shit was that amazing! I kept on doing the whole, &#34;Hey! What is in that corner?&#34; *Shove a fork full of her food in my face* The kim-chi was addicting and the meat was super tender. I had major food envy.

 By the end of our second visit, I started having memories from years ago when Chipotle only had only one location and everyone knew that it would be nationwide one day. Scratch Burrito has that same feel.

It offers healthy and comfort foods at a culinary level rarely experienced for less than $10 a plate. Pair that with just the right touch of variety and alcohol options, and you have a place that can make everyone happy. I started as a skeptic. I couldn&#39;t get motivated by any of the recipes, so my first choice was an Indian influenced lamb burrito. After being blown away, we switched halfway through, and the #2 chicken burrito was equally impressive. The high level of flavor combination and execution was very surprising. The next visit we went with vegetarian and blackened catfish burritos...both were dynamite. It only took a few bites to cure my skepticism. In November, the menu will change with the seasons, and we&#39;ll certainly be back to try the new additions.   

As far as the environment, half of the restaurant contains bar height tables and the other half provides regular options. You have environment choices...oh and I left out the patio seating and corn hole court. 

If you want an inexpensive, casual night and possibly a beer or cocktail with your delicious dinner, then Scratch Burrito should be on the short list in The Highlands."

We heard a lot of buzz about the $10 burritos, but figured it was too expensive for a burrito.  We were so wrong!  The ingredients that they use in their unique and crafty take on burritos won us over and were fresh and delicious!  The value for your money is apparent.

Upon walking in, we asked the guy at the counter what he recommended and he said the #6 and the #8.  The #6 if I remember correctly was my absolute favorite.  It had creamy coconut curry rice, organic chicken, veggies and cilantro.  It was fabulous and required a few napkins to help with the overflow.  The #8 was a tandoori lamb burrito with curry rice, cucumber, and possibly mint.  Also delish!

They cut the burritos in half for is so we could try each other&#39;s food.  The gentleman at the counter also checked in on us while we were eating to see if we liked it...and we really did.

I will be back and am so happy that this place is in my backyard (though I wish literally it was).  I really enjoy the spin on the typical burrito and welcome the new and exciting flavor options for my next visit!"

Not a beer drinker, but when I was there it looked like there were a number of happy people sucking down the food and drink and enjoying hanging out there.

I had the coconut curry with chicken and stir fry burrito. DELICIOUS. Veggies were cooked perfectly and the curry flavoring was just right, spicy but not overbearing. Their hot sauce was delicious too. My fiance got the Korean BBQ burrito, he enjoyed but found it a little over seasoned. His burrito had a lot of sauces in it causing the tortilla to become soft and stick to the foil it was wrapped in and completely fall apart. They offer a &#34;seasonal side&#34; that you cannot change or modify, we got the potato salad (but it tasted more like coleslaw).

Excellent and large.
I had the pork, rice and kim-chi. I love kim-chi. It was tasty. My only complaint is that I want enough garlic in the fermented goodness to kill vampires living in Nebraska. And, I want enough pepper oomph to make my eyes bleed. They need increase both in this kim-chi.
We ate on the north patio and it was pleasant even though the outside temperature was 33 °C according to my weather app.
Free Wi-Fi is good.

The people who are going to really like this place are those that will come for beers and a welcoming atmosphere. They will be fine with paying $9.50 for a very good burrito.

The people who are going to dislike this place are those who compare the burrito price with Chipotle/Qdoba. If all you focus on is $6.50 versus $9.50, then you will be grumpy.

The one big negative is NO HAPPY HOUR. (01OCT2013 - website says: Happy Hour 1500-1800)"

Once?  Okay, good.  My boyfriend, my sister and I headed to Scratch last Friday night after getting a recommendation from our real estate agent/friend/Denverite and I was pretty excited.  All the menu options looked outstanding.  The cashier taking our order was not friendly, patient or attentive, so things weren&#39;t off to a good start.  My sister and I both ordered some drinks and when they finally arrived they were HORRIBLE.  The margarita tasted like watered down tequila and the Moscow Mule was unmistakably made with bourbon instead of vodka.  Later my boyfriend went to the bar to get some waters and actually watched the bartender use bourbon, so I guess she decided to make everyone&#39;s wrong, not just ours.  Phew, I was starting to think it was personal.

FORTY MINUTES LATER, our food arrived.  I should probably add that we were told it&#39;d be 15 minutes.  Forty minutes is a long wait at a sit-down restaurant, let alone a place where you order at a counter.  I would have forgiven the long wait IF the food had made up for it.  But it didn&#39;t.  My veggie burrito was bland and nothing at Scratch was worth the $45 the 3 of us paid for it.  Someone did come out and apologize for the wait on the food, but the damage was done by then.  For me, at least.  My sister and boyfriend were pretty happy with their food so I think they were a little more receptive to the apology.  As for me, I think I&#39;ll just take myself to Chipotle next time.  I hear they even make a pretty good Patron margarita."

Scratch offers a wide range of burritos, I can account for the Chipotle Steak as being top notch.  I guess I should expect when everything is made from scratch and it cost nearly $10 for a burrito.  The chocolate filled empanads didn&#39;t suck either, but then nearly anything filled with chocolate and deep fried taste good.

I had the lacquered pork with kimchi, edamame and the quinoa. It came with a side of cucumber sesame salad with seaweed! It was great...

We got a huge spread of guac, salsa, chips, empanadas, ahi tuna tostadas, Vietnamese chicken wings, several thai curry burritos, a korean bbq burrito, and a rosemary chicken burrito. All of it was delicious, fresh and healthy tasting.

My only issue was that when we placed the order over the phone, the girl who took the order told us it would be ready to be picked up in 10-15 mins. Once we got to the restaurant to pick up our food, we had to wait an additional 30 mins..which was pretty inconvenient and a big difference from the expectation that was set for us with the 10-15 time frame quoted on the phone. 

Overall great and inventive food."

We ordered the chipolte burrito # 3. The burrito consisted more of uncooked rice and jalapenos then anything else. Guacamole was over salted. Appears to be a trenty place, but the food is really not good. Probably the worst Mexican I&#39;ve ever had! The Blackberry mojito was good. People must be super drunk to write these reviews.

When we first arrived we were greeted by a game hostess connoisseur. She asked us what we were interested in and a few short minutes later we had a new game in front of us! After a quick how-to we were off to the races. A $5 &#34;buy in&#34;got us hours of fun with a bunch of games we probably never would&#39;ve known about! I enjoyed a deliciously large roast beef panini and a coffee stout while dominating our game. 

By the end of the night we had made a new friend in the owner, Keith, who just wants to share his love of games with other Denverites.

I can&#39;t wait to get back. I definytelencourage of my fellow Yelpers to get out and support this awesome new local business!"

When you enter, pick a table that will accommodate your group. A friendly server/gamer will ask for food/drink orders. You and your group can go browse the massive wall of games. Make note of who is working that day if you want to learn a new game; then make sure to choose a game with one of their names on the side of the box... just in case you need help. 

My friends and I enjoyed several beverages, played one new and one old game, and had some bites, all of which was enjoyable. I&#39;ll be back for more fun and games!

pros:
1) awesome selection of games!
2) terrific space, layout. well lit.
3) good selection of food (sandwiches and apps) &amp; drinks (ciders, beers, cocktails)

areas needing improvement:
1) more instructions - a sign that tells customers who is working and to find games with one of those names on it if we want help learning a new game
2) more instructions - greet us at the door and tell us to pick a game, and where to return it. (they have a table set aside for returned games, so they can make sure all the pieces were put back before re-shelving it)."

I went with my wife, and Keith was very helpful suggesting some 2 player games we would like and spent some time explaining the rules so we didn&#39;t have to read the instructions. We didn&#39;t think the prices were unreasonable and the $5 per person fee was fair.

When we went it was all couples, but they have a bunch of tables for four and a few larger tables for groups. They even have some weekly events that they host.  We had a lot of fun and will definitely be back!"

BGR is located in The Yard, which includes a diverse set of businesses including some breweries / distillers and art shops. Parking is readily available as well. 

BGR offers a ton of board games that take up an entire side of a wall. Games are all nicely organized by categories such as card/short, family-fun and epic. Board games include everything from Stratego, Uno, Settlers, Seven Wonders, Dead of Winter and bunch of games I&#39;ve never seen before. It&#39;s $5 per person for unlimited game time. Seems like an awesome deal to me. They also offer panini and drinks. No comment on the food quality, but would definitely come back to grab some beers and play board games.

The games are plentiful and all appear to be in great shape -- no broken boxes or missing pieces that we could see, and they were neatly organized (definitely better than the game shelves at my house)!  ;) Everything had a bright, airy feel and a playful vibe, and the staff was friendly.

My only two negative notes: the air conditioning was blasting the whole time we were there and no matter where we sat it was positively arctic (maybe this was just a single occurence/anomaly, but bring a sweatshirt to be safe!) and the $5 gaming fee per person seems a little much, especially when the menu items are already a bit steep. We&#39;ve been to a couple other board-game-pub concepts in other states, and this is the only one we&#39;ve visited that has a separate gaming fee (I do understand table turnover and the need to make money, but maybe they could only charge the fee for patrons who don&#39;t order from the menu, or, like comedy clubs, impose a 2-drink minimum? I don&#39;t know, something about the separate fee just felt off-putting and a tad... crass). That said, I do appreciate their transparency there; we knew about the fee ahead of time and therefore didn&#39;t feel &#34;taken&#34; by any means.

All in, we had a great time and it&#39;s well-deserving of four stars. I&#39;m also grateful Denver has a new option for the ol&#39; &#34;what should we do tonight&#34; dilema."

The thing I really like is that with the wide variety of games, chances are good one doesn&#39;t know how to play them, and reading rules takes too long, so they have staff members who can explain how the games are played. Very cool concept.

( Yep you heard me right there are Vegan options here. They section their buffet so there is a veggie side and a flesh eater side.) I recommend you come and try their signature drinks: the Jalapeño Lager, their Specialty Moscow Mule, or the Chai Martini, heck they even have a Chai Stout. With this many drink options you can&#39;t go wrong.

I am VERY glad that they have two separate main buffet areas, in which the meat is separated from the vegan and vegetarian options. . . this is something very important to me and I am very grateful =) 

Tips for vegans: If you don&#39;t wanna see people scooping out loads of dead animal carcasses while you are eating, sit on the opposite side of the floor from where the meat buffet is, we try to grab a table on the far right near the wall, etc.

When becoming a regular Yak &amp; Yeti enthusiast, the staff becomes your friend and remembers your speciality orders =) they always make sure to ask about my vegan roti or vegan chai =) in which I almost always want both!

I bring new peeps here all the time and they love it! If family is visiting from out of town, this would be at the top of the list!

I came for the lunch buffet and everything was so hot and well prepared. The selection is varied and everything tasted so fresh and very flavorful. I especially love the hot sauce they make in house. It goes with just about every dish! Service was very friendly and fast. They were right on refilling our glasses and checking in with us. One guy who works there is from Mumbai so we chatted with him a little since my dad goes to India a lot for work. The decor is very nice too. The restaurant itself is a little dated but everything was clean and the restaurant was well staffed. I also liked that they have a separate entertaining space for parties. Love this little lunch spot. Although, please replace your tattered American flag outside of your restaurant!! It&#39;s disrespectful to fly the American flag in as awful condition as yours is in. For that reason I take away a star.

Update: I came in here with a guest for lunch and I take away another star for the customer service. Every single employee I encountered today had some kind of attitude. We were very kind when ordering and polite, and there were no smiles from the staff or any kind of kindness or &#34;thank you&#34; or &#34;my pleasure sir.

But even though the food is a five star experience, the staff somehow managed to surpass it in fun, joy, and pure friendliness. We can&#39;t wait to come back, and we will be certain to look for our new waiter friend, Ganesh. What a great guy!

For starters the Korma which should have a mild coconut flavor but this tasted like creamed very mild curry with vegetables sweetened with sugar. Their Saag Paneer tasted like canned creamed spinach, no cumin, coriander or hardly any spice. Chicken Tikka Masala, tasted like heavy cream, tomato sauce and that&#39;s it. In fact everything tasted the same. I&#39;ve been eating Indian food since I was a little kid and you would not be able to taste the difference from one dish to the next here, it was all one heavy cream blob. Even the Kheer the traditional indian rice dessert is made with cardamom without this spice it&#39;s just american style rice pudding which is exactly what they served because there was no trace of cardamom.

Sorry to say but really good authentic Indian is aromatic and full of heady exotic spices giving each dish it&#39;s own unique flavor. Indian food is not just all curry and cream. I left with my plate still full of food and not fulfilling my indian food craving. Feeling bad that I cheated on India&#39;s just down the street where Kris the owner and his staff make amazing authentic food passed down by generations of family back in India. While they don&#39;t have a colorful salad bar, brown rice, or a version of chow mein?....  it&#39;s the real thing."

We were greeted by the people here... And I have to agree with some of the reviewers that the staff was kinda aloof... But they were still nice and took your plates when they started piling up. 

The food was on point my friends! Love the variety... From the salad bar to the hot food. I tried to stay away from the fried foods (because I know that I&#39;d get full too quickly), but seriously once you find your favorites you just can&#39;t help but pile it on your plate. Being pregnant and craving Indian food doesn&#39;t help because you could barely fit anymore in this growing belly... But I was a big fan of the saag paneer, sweet potato masala, and the cauliflower! The Saffron rice was good with everything! There was a lamb dish which was awesome too! If you are a chicken fan there are lots of chicken choices. You really could be picky and be able to eat and be merry!

The only mistake was that I had a half plate too much... As the desserts were so dang delicious! I had to go back and get another sample of the desserts, because that was just the right thing to do!

I&#39;m sure hubby and I will be back again. Looking forward to it!"

The selection was awesome and the quality was excellent. Service was very good and the chai was top notch.

My boyfriend and I went on a cold summer evening and we were more than satisfied. There&#39;s 3 types of rice available (white, brown, saffron), and they bring fresh baked pita to the table. 

There&#39;s two main tables of food, one vegetarian and the other meat, which was convenient since I was on a pescatarian diet that week. 

My favorite was the VEGGIE SAMOSA - might have been the texture but I LOVED it. Some other dishes I enjoyed were the sweet potato masala (I&#39;m biased toward sweet potatoes but it was done well), saag paneer (my go to), and the veggie korma! I&#39;d skip the noodles - they&#39;re subpar in my opinion.

The desserts table was also well stocked with carrot pudding, mango mousse, fresh fruit, and other goodies. 

I need to come back to try their Rose Lassi - sounds delicious!"

The space is interesting.  It&#39;s a convention/event center so for your weddings, conferences, etc..., but it&#39;s also has a buffet in a side room.  The food is what you would expect from an Indian lunch buffet.  It&#39;s full of flavor, spicy and a plenty.  There is choices for everyone, so if you&#39;re a carnivore, a vegetarian or vegan...you can all come here at the same time.  Of note, if it says spicy...it&#39;s spicy, but it&#39;s a good spice.  I say that because I still tasted the food after consuming the spicy dish.  Here&#39;s what I would say from a first impression standpoint.  Your initial reaction will probably be questionable because the space for the buffet almost feels like an afterthought, but give it a shot because the food can and will stand for itself and for the cost, it is quite a good deal."

Kids meal of 2 chicken thighs and a chicken leg was enormous for our 2 year old grandson, who consumed my mango lassi with great enthusiasm. The ambiance is suspect with all the bright lights, but the food quality and the large number of Indian patrons tells us this is the real deal, now located a stone&#39;s throw from our all time favorite India&#39;s.

At the buffet end I have had to wait up to 30 minutes for anyone to come ask if I&#39;d like my check or even for a drink.  

When I order online through Grub Hub it takes forever and the last two times the food showed up cold.  The last time it showed up two hours after I had ordered it.

I thought about ordering online for pick up but I just don&#39;t want to have to wait an hour or two for it to be prepped I worry that they might not make it at all.  I&#39;d show up and order it for pick up there but the lay out is weird and awkward as there is no hostess stand or set up place to order and wait.

Until they sort this stuff out I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth going there.  I value my time and might just need to learn how to cook this type of food at home instead.  At least at the end of that hour or two the food would be warm."

The building and atmosphere are very strange for an Indian restaurant. It used to be this event center and still looks like it could host weddings. We were greeted by someone who tried to take us to the buffet and we said we didn&#39;t want it and she did not know what to do with us. There was a language barrier. We gestured to the bar and went.

Once at the bar, things went much better. The bartender greeted us quickly. Gave us samples of the beers they brewed. There was a cherry and a chai stout, both very good. We were brought poppadoms and sauces. The naan was freshly made and amazing. We had a lamb curry that was to die for. We had a choice of rice, plain or saffron. Much more impressed by the beer and food than the atmosphere.

So, check it out and let me know what you think. I might go back. I&#39;m on the fence. Atmosphere is a big deal and this place just doesn&#39;t have it."

If you&#39;re not sure what to try, just get a nice spoon of rice and get a little sample of everything else.

The service here is interesting. Kind of slow and inattentive, but I guess you don&#39;t need spectacular service at a buffet, though, it would be nice.

What&#39;s not to love about a Mexican wedding happening in the other room while you&#39;re choking down on Nepali food? Wait, where am I? Ah yes, Aurora. Why wouldn&#39;t there by an authentic Mexican wedding at a Nepali restaurant. 

We ordered a few different things and were disappointed with it all. We ordered a noodle dish, the tandoori chicken wings, and some naan. The &#34;noodle&#34; dish was spicy spaghetti with a conglomerate of chicken and bell peppers and ..did I mention the spaghetti noodles? Like 5 lbs of it. 

I was expecting the same amazing wings but out came a plate of regular chicken &#34;wings.&#34; Moment of sadness. 

The yogurt sauce and chutney salsa made it all better. Sort of. Except the overall experience. Going back to Arvada and having a beer."

I am new to the area and trying to venture out and learn about all the Indian food to enjoy. I ordered garlic naan, roti, and chicken tikka masala. The garlic naan was delicious and moist, albeit a bit thin. The roti was also pretty standard and delicious. The chicken tikka masala is the thing that disappointed me, regarding to the size. The entree was ~$15 and the tub of chicken tikka masala was quite small for the price. The chicken tikka masala had chicken that was delicious enough, and full of meat, which is always a plus. The rice was yellow basmati rice and offered in a large container, which felt a bit imbalanced in regards to the entree size. I would probably not order from here again, unless there were no other options, however mostly due to size rather than taste."

The food is delicious. Spices, quality, even temperature of the food are all better than other Indian restaurants you&#39;ll find in town. Other Indian restaurants with buffets offer buffet food that isn&#39;t temperature hot...its warm, but definitely not hot which gives it that &#34;it might not be so fresh&#34; feel to it. The Yak is not like this... the food is always hot and attended to. 

Services is always excellent. They&#39;re always so polite and it is appreciated. I always wonder how to tip when going to an Indian buffet, however. Do you tip 30%, 20%, lower? I don&#39;t know. Its not full service. 

The restrooms are a bit sketchy however. I want to go to India without experiencing the awkward uncleanliness of a traditional Indian restroom. No, I jest obviously, but in truth, the restrooms could be a little nicer, a little cleaner, more tended to. 

Yep I just talked about food and toilets in the same post. Weird.

Brown rice available.  Freshest salad (greens) I&#39;ve seen at an Indian restaurant.  Saag is more soupy than one would prefer - too much dairy/cream.  Lentils are cooked with red beans; I wish they were without.

The supper buffet isn&#39;t that much different than the lunch buffet, only $4 more.  They do replace some of the chicken dishes with shrimp."

The restaurant is tucked away in a spot where it may not pop off as super popular, but trust me...you need to stop and check this place out. 

We ordered the apricot blonde beers, which were super fruity and freshly brewed. The beers are huge! Awesome size for the price. We then ordered the garlic naan (chunks of real garlic, yes please!) and three dishes. We each ordered something different: my husband ordered chicken tandoori (in which he ate all of), I ordered chicken curry (bursting with flavor), and my mom ordered chicken mis-oh lord I forgot the name of, but a tomato cream sauce. We each loved it and my mom was amazed by the fluffy, delectable rice! She stated to me she loved it and was happy we tried it! My husband was confused and intrigued by the spices since he never experienced anything of the sort before, but he was super happy when we left. Of course, I absolutely adored the richness of the curry. We will definitely be back: great prices, great food, and good service. Awesome job guys!!!"

When you walk in, there&#39;s a very large room on the left, and a very small room on the right.  The lunch buffet was set up in the small room.  Most of the tables in this room are set up in small niches in the walls - very odd.  The steam tables for the lunch buffet are set up down the center of this small room.  I don&#39;t know if the lunch buffet is always in this room or if the a/c is always set on &#39;warm&#39;, but the day I went it was like a sauna in there.  It&#39;s way too small of a room for all the heat and steam from those tables.  Just sayin...

On a more positive note, the all food I tried was good.  I don&#39;t remember everything I had, but two things really stood out for me - the chicken vegetable soup and the cucumber salad. Both had exceptional flavor.  The service was also very good.  My iced tea was always quickly refilled and empty plates were taken away in a timely manner.

Can you really ask for more? 
It&#39;s not always easy finding an Indian buffet where the food is actually good, but this place is the exception. In particular, the korma, saag paneer and chicken tikka masala are excellent, and they have a selection of pakora and samosa, soups and even desserts (all hail galub jamun in its infinite deliciousness!) to choose from as well. 
Service is always prompt and attentive, bringing fresh naan when you need it, and of course, bringing more of that amazing chai stout. BLESS. If you&#39;re not into beer, the regular chai tea is quite good as well. 
Make sure you go on an empty stomach- you&#39;re going to need all the room you can get, because you WILL stuff yourself silly."

Everything is running smoothly and delicious as usual. I am happy to see that the buffet is still Scrumdiddlyumptious! I love my basmati rice that is flavored and my chicken tiki masala, and of course the Tamarind sauce that goes over my rice. One of my absolute favorite things about the meal is enjoying the chai it ties everything together. I will continue coming here and enjoying my lunches with my wonderful husband and the staff here is consistent and wonderful there is a waitress that has been here from the beginning and I&#39;d like seeing familiar faces every time I come here.

The venue was quite small as all the tables were very close together. Trying to squeeze through all the chairs was like a maze lol. That&#39;s including the bar, we always felt as if we were in the way of someone. 

Speaking of the bar, it is a fully stocked bar. The reception had open bar so enough said haha. My fiancée had the yak&#39;s choice, which he liked the most because it was a dark IPA, not as bitter but full of flavors. The worst we had was the apple ale, it was very tart and bitter that left a horrible after taste. For non-alcoholic drinks, my table and I got multiple cups of chai tea. Very delicious and warm especially on a cold and snowy night. We also had the mango lassi, it tasted as if you were eating a mango. Very flavorful and thick. 

Moving onto the food and this being our first Nepalese wedding, we weren&#39;t told that the first buffet was just appetizers, which were all quite spicy. Our whole table thought it was dinner too as we all grabbed for seconds of samosas because those were just downright delicious. Until one of the wedding guests explained the courses, thank goodness because we had an hour to digest before dinner lol. Once the dinner buffet was brought out, we were all too full to eat anymore, but wanting to try the dinner courses, we got a bite of everything. We tried the goat, fish, veggie noodles, and of course the naan with a spinach dish. Sorry I don&#39;t remember the names of all the dishes. The food tasted pretty delicious but we were all too full to get the complete experience."

It&#39;s a must-go for their buffet! I&#39;ve had no such luck with finding a decent Indian food buffet. Most I&#39;ve been to rarely would replenish the food only because I assume their lunch buffet was never really busy, so the amount of food and freshness was never important..? Either way, this place was the COMPLETE opposite! The buffet ends at 3:00 and dinner begins at 4:00. So if you&#39;re a late attendee (kind of like we were), you still have an hour to take advantage of the buffet! 

My family and I got there at about 2:30. We were skeptical to go through with our visit because as I said, the tail ends of buffets are usually full of cold, old, and not worth eating type of food and we just didn&#39;t want to be some of ~*those*~ people to show up last second. NOT HERE! In fact, there were a few other parties to come and eat after we had even been there for awhile. I was pleasantly surprised to see plentiful amounts of food still available, BUT I was still skeptical. That food could have been sitting there the entire time just getting cold and that was what was left. NOPE! I made a plate of food, sat down to begin eating and everything on my plate tasted very fresh and incredibly delicious. As I was eating I noticed they replenished the food a good number of times. Something would run out or get close and they&#39;d refill with more and I couldn&#39;t even believe I was seeing that! Clearly I&#39;m somewhat scarred by previous Indian buffet experiences, but this one gave me a whole new lease and outlook on life, I feel so alive again! :D 

A standout favorite amongst my mom, sister, and me was the Sweet Potato Masala. YUM! It was a nice twist on the classic Chicken Masala! The Mango Custard was my two little nephew&#39;s favorites. But overall, their selection is enormous! You will not have a hard time finding something to choose from. Usually I&#39;m only able to find one or two dishes that look edible and stick with that just to get my money&#39;s worth if it ends up being a fail. But as I keep repeating, you will definitely find what you&#39;re looking for here, and then some! 

As for the staff, they are more than accommodating and willing to get more Naan or fill up your drinks or help answer any questions you may have. They are so friendly and even give you the option to box up your leftovers if you have any on your last plate. I definitely plan on returning here and now happily call this my go-to Indian food buffet. Give it a try because no matter when you show up, I&#39;m sure you will not be disappointed. And if you are, it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re the kind of person that makes Yelp reviews about your hatred of establishment&#39;s parking lots and restaurant locations and other irrelevant concerns rather than actually talking about the food and its quality."

Lamb Roti - dry and uber salty, Naan on the dry side as well. The buffet not only lacked substance but also appeal. 
Dirty dishes as well as very mediocre service. Our table was not cleaned or bused since we sat down.
Granted they were busy due to a large party but with so many Indian choices around, we won&#39;t be back ....
Not sure if other Yelpers just had better luck with this place."

The food is extremely well done. It&#39;s tasty and fresh. 
The servers were nice, and were very patient with a large group (our book club)
The owner was very sweet to accommodate us as a large group, for free, in the upstairs rooms. 
The place itself is very cool (to me). The downstairs is spectacular (if not well laid out currently)---huge chandeliers, gorgeous bar, a cool view of the kitchen prep area, etc. 
The upstairs is a bit shabby but it has it&#39;s own bar, which could be used, and a little library room which is just delightful. 
Prices are VERY reasonable. I ate like a king, and had two cocktails, and with leftovers to boot and it cost about 35$! 

Cons: 
The service is...slow and rather unprofessional (hand written bills on scraps of paper, many different expeditors for one person, staff had trouble understanding American English accents, etc.) They&#39;re super nice and sweet, but they&#39;re not at the level I&#39;d like.
 
The place itself needs work. It&#39;s clearly mid-renovation, but there&#39;s things like a sad music speaker with frayed wire hanging out on a bar upstairs, carpets that would really benefit from a good shampoo-ing, an ancient &#34;feminine supplies&#34; machine that is so old it is still charging a DIME in the ladies&#39; room, piles of chairs and tables in corners, fixtures and incidentals that are very dated, etc. This gives it a kind of charm to me, but I can see how it would be a big turn off to a lot of customers. In my opinion, they need to sink a lot of money into fixing the place up or just do a few cosmetic touches---get rid of the nine million chairs in the upstairs hallway, go through and touch up paint, update the tables, etc. 

The furnishings really need help--cheap poly chair covers over super crappy chairs, wobbly tables that looked rescued from someone&#39;s garage, etc. 

The tableware: where to begin. 
Some of it was lovely: hammered silver bowls and pitchers, nice cut glass goblets. But all the fried food came on super low rent pizza parlor plastic boats with wax paper lining, and my Moscow Mule came in a hurricane glass (!!). The beer steins were very dated as well--huge potbellied vintage pub glasses. 

Again, in my opinion, they need to standardize, otherwise it gives a frantic, slapdash feel. Either go vintage and kitchy, or go upscale. It seems like they bought the lot of tableware from the previous owners of the space and didn&#39;t really invest in a unique look/feel.
 
It&#39;s like they&#39;re going for a &#34;classy&#34; space (leather bound menus, giant chandeliers, fancy drinks, etc) but kind of ran out of money? In this case, maybe have one set of menus for events, and one set for everyday diners. Same with tableware and cutlery. 
Overall, I loved it though and those were minor complaints."

The Indian food at the Yak and Yeti. 

BIGGEST selection I&#39;ve ever seen (as big as the that of the Westminster location, my review of which was featured as the Review of the Day on 10/2/2013). But really, what makes it is the flavor. So, so good. I can&#39;t even begin to describe it, which is why you need to try it for yourself!"

Like the most flavorless soupy Saag Paneer I&#39;ve ever tasted. The only thing I enjoyed was the red sauce that came with the chicken. I&#39;m spacing the name. Since I ate naan and the red sauce, I asked if I could get half off the buffet price. They gave it to me no questions asked. I really appreciated that. I also appreciated management coming by to see if they could make the experience better. Unfortunately, they couldn&#39;t!

So I recently began my 22 day vegan challenge and wanted to check out what &#34;good&#34; vegan food tastes like and this place was PERFECT!!! I did the buffet option which gives you a vast amount of options to choose from. They cater to both meat eaters and non-meat eaters. My favorite dishes were the Saag paneer (which is like tofu) and the daal tarka. The total for my meal was about $13 which is reasonable considering the amount of food I ate.I&#39;ll definitely be back here again... even when I end this vegan diet! ;)"

I&#39;ve eaten at many Indian buffets across the Denver area: India&#39;s Restaurant, India&#39;s Castle, Little India, India Oven, Masalaa (you name it, I&#39;ve been there), and Yak and Yeti blow all of these places out of the water.

The selection is massive - and for $10.95 for the lunch buffet, they offer an insane amount of variety. There were at least 6 vegetarian curries on offer, as well as several chicken varieties - plus vegetable samosas (flaky, crispy) and the best vegetable pakora I&#39;ve had anywhere in Denver (crisp, not soggy, full of flavour). Their saffron rice was flavourful and the perfect texture (they also offer basmati). I tried every vegetarian curry they offered and they were all excellent - but the sweet potato masala was a standout; I was crazy full after one plate, but returned for a second small portion of that, because it was too good not to. There were also two soups - a chicken and a vegetarian coconut soup on the buffet.

Not only that, but another table offered a selection of salads, chutneys (cilantro, tamarind, among others) chili, pickles, onion pickle/salad (so delicious!), and of course, raita - which was excellent. Honestly, I was sad because there was so much that I wanted to eat, and I could only eat a small amount! A large, fresh basket of naan is brought to your table. 

The dessert offerings were vast - and unfortunately I&#39;d stuffed myself too full to try anything other than a single gulab jamun (served warm as it should be! Not cold like so many other places), but there were banana fritters that looked delicious, carrot halwa, and two others that I couldn&#39;t remember, but everything looked really good. 

The location is a little tucked away (you turn on to Dayton off of Hampden) and the building appears to be an old banquet hall - they still offer banquets/large group seatings - so I imagine there&#39;s some amazing Indian weddings held here! And the interior is very intimate on the buffet side - little private style booths. 

The owner checked in on us periodically to make sure everything was okay, and the service was exceptional - our waters and chai were refilled promptly. We were even offered samples of their beers that they brew - which were excellent. I couldn&#39;t have asked for better service. In the past I&#39;ve been to buffets where the service was surly, or the food was so-so (some good things, some not so good), but this place was exceptional - I can&#39;t think of anything negative at all.

Oh! My boyfriend ordered the IPA and the mug it came in (with the Yak and Yeti logo on it) was really neat - I asked the waiter if they sold them, and he said they didn&#39;t - they should definitely offer them for sale as we would have bought a couple of them!

I won&#39;t be venturing to any other Indian restaurant from now on - I can&#39;t see how anything else would even compare to Yak and Yeti. We&#39;ll definitely be back again soon!"

Yak and Yeti had me sold once I saw that it was Indian cuisine. Then I was even more sold with their Chai Stout. 

There are multiple locations, but we did this one cause it was the closest to us after doing a Costco run. First thing we notice upon arrival...it&#39;s a buffet! Filled my plate with my staples - vegetable samosa, saag paneer, and chicken tikka masala. The samosas are huge compared to what I&#39;ve had in California. The saag was deeeeelicious both with the basmati rice and naan. The chicken tikka masala was little watery and the chicken wasn&#39;t as tender but it looked like no one had taken some from the buffet area. Still good though, I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t try it cause chicken tikka masala was the dish that got me into Indian cuisine. 

The chai stout was how I envisioned it. Mellow chai flavor throughout each sip that balanced the heavy flavor to typical stouts. Another new thing I tried is banana pakora. I&#39;ve never had Indian desserts, but this is a game changer. Banana pieces fried in dough and topped with sugar. Oh My God!

Want Indian, Nepalese, or Tibetan food, come to Yak and Yeti. They have 3 locations!"

However, like most rules there is room for shades of grey. Y &amp; Y definitely deserves an exception. Thus far, I have gone twice for the lunch buffet and each time, I have been surprised and enjoyed myself.

On the first visit, I went with the DTC Lunch club and that was my first introduction. I checked out the buffet and picked up lots of different things, however what stood out was the sweet potato masala. Oh my, this was delicious and I&#39;m not a vegetarian. I don&#39;t recall the soup that we tried, but it was only ok. The naan was tasty and the tandoori chicken is always a solid choice.

On the next visit, I knew I wanted the sweet potato masala, tried a cauliflower/potato curry, along with a chicken curry, and samosas. I was full and happy. I do need to come back and try some of their beers. Thus far, both visits have been for lunch during the week. I do plan on bringing the man here to try it. I think several of the menu items are vegetarian-friendly."

Hubs and I head to this establishment since we are in the neighborhood.  Actually, I wanted to head up further west, to another Asian establishment.  Thankfully, we head to Yak and Yeti instead.  When we came in, since its Halloween, they have a function on the Left Wing of this Event space.  We are ushered to the Right Wing of the Event space, where there are plenty of Booth Seating, in their own &#34;Enclosed Space&#34;.

We opt to have both the Dinner Buffet which was ($14.95) per person and Restaurant Menu items.

From what I recall, we had these items from the Restaurant Menu :

*  Jalapeno Cheese Naan
*  Chai Tea
*  Coffee

From what I could recall, from the Buffet items, they include :

*  Saffron Rice
*  Basmati Rice
*  Shrimp Curry
*  Fish Chili
*  Tandoori Chicken
*  Chicken Korma
*  Lamb dish
*  Chicken Soup
*  Saag Paneer
*  Daal
*  Vegetable Pakora

For the Desserts, if I could recall, they offer :

*  Banana Pakora
*  Carrot Pudding
*  Gulab Jammun

As for the additional condiments they provide were :

*  Raita
*  Mixed Fruit Chutney
*  Mint Chutney
*  Hot Sauce
*  Pickled Red Onions

Hubs and I enjoyed our Dinner Buffet here.  The staffs are welcoming and the service is prompt.  They come periodically to fill up our water.  We had like about 4 cups of Chai Tea in which, the 2nd batch they make it to our liking, since Hubs mentioned it to the Owner that it was a tad to sweet for Hubs.

When the items in each of the Chaffing Dish is almost empty, they will fill up with new tray of hot piping food.  All in all, Yak and Yeti DENVER Location has ALOT of Potential and we are glad that they opened in this part of Neighborhood.  Furthermore, it definitely a GOOD Addition of eateries along E. Hampden Ave.

This recent visit was on Friday October 31st 2014.  We spent about $45.04 with tax for Dinner before tips.  We left the establishment about 20:45hrs ish stuffed and belly tummy filled!

Let&#39;s just say I haven&#39;t been disappointed.

Well, the first time I was in was for the lunch buffet shortly after they opened. Everything was good, but it didn&#39;t really stand out to me. I guess they have it all figured out, as the past two times have been amazing. First off, they do a dinner buffet too! Complete with lamb curry, sweet potato tika masala, saffron rice, and so much more - both meat and meatless. The star though was the chicken chili...fried chicken pieces with a chili sauce that was incredibly addicting...not too spicy, but had some kick. Great naan bread too. I&#39;ve had their lamb vindaloo as well, which is also quite good.

That&#39;s great and all, but what about Y&amp;Y beer? Yes! Well, not the full array, but the chai milk stout, IPA, and a new one called Yak&#39;s Choice (think cascadian dark...very good) + some other local brews on tap. And the service has been so friendly, both dining in and take-out.

I yelped good Indian buffets and came across Y&amp;Y on a visit to Denver last December. When I moved here a few weeks ago, it had to be my first stop!

The restaurant is easily seen with it&#39;s large, appealing signage. As the title says, they have a big, elegant event space that you&#39;ll see when you enter. They have a full menu, but both times I&#39;ve gone straight for the buffet. How can you not? Booth seating surround the buffet by a few feet, so you&#39;ll get an instant perception of the food&#39;s quality. Always looks and smells delicious.

The buffet is eleven or twelve bucks. Well worth my saved pennies, with the huge selection and hot, fresh naan. The waiter brings it to you almost immediately. The vegetable samosas are amazing. The first time I visited, they had sweet potato tikka masala, SO GOOD. About five different deserts varying in sweetness. My favorites are the carrot pudding and gulab jamun. 

I can&#39;t rave about this place enough. I will definitely be here again and I&#39;ll be sure to make it my girlfriend&#39;s first Denver stop too!"

How can you not want to try this place? Stopped in yesterday for some lunch expecting to order and to our surprise they had a buffet on the weekend! YES PLEASE! My boyfriend had the Pilsner and I had the cider, both great! The buffet was filled with wonderful options and is a great option if you like exploring other food options. Their lamb curry was amazing with tasty flavors. Some of my curry and chicken tikki masala sauce blended together which became a sauce for my naan. Highly recommend checking this place out!"

Not my favorite beers but fun to try, although,I couldn&#39;t finish the jalapeño beer. The food was really good. Some of the best saag paneer I&#39;ve had. Great options in the buffet!

And at Yak and Yeti, both the food and drink are delicious. The Rupee Red just came back on tap and we really enjoyed it.

The buffet is about $14.95 (ish) for dinner and includes salads, soups, vegetarian options, as well as meat dishes and desserts. Naan is brought to your table. You can also order off the menu - just ask and they will bring one out."

It was a Saturday evening and the restaurant was fairly  busy. The food on the buffet looked  fresh enough but didn&#39;t excite us. Our used plates were for not taken off our table until we had almost finished dinner. The people working in the restaurant including our server seemed almost unhappy and rarely smiled.

The sweet potato masala was different and pretty tasty but I didn&#39;t want to make a meal of it. I tried kheer which is one of my favorite desserts, and it was bland and chunky. It was missing the pistachios or almonds and bit of spice that most Indian restaurants usually add so well. Overall, it was very disappointing. 

Finally, there was a wedding or reception next door and it was incredibly loud. It really took away from the dining experience. Getting out of the parking lot afterwards was a little daunting with all of the incoming wedding guests. The dining room and  buffet really do feel like an afterthought. I&#39;ve heard such good things about the location in Arvada. We were very disappointed with this location however. 

As someone else said, go a little ways down the road to Star Of India."

The main dining hall was being set up for a Quinceañera I think, the server said it was as sweet 15 party so I&#39;m guessing thats what she meant. We were walked with very little interaction from our server to this tiny hole in the wall booth. There were several booths at the end of this smaller dinning room that had holes in the wall and were missing tables and benches entirely, it looked like a dump.  Now, I&#39;m no skinny mini but I&#39;m not a huge person either, the booth we were sat in would have been difficult for kids to get into. It was uncomfortable and the walls are covered in cheap office carpet. 

Our drink orders were taken almost 10 minutes after we squeezed into our booth, again minimal interaction from the servers and then we just assumed we could go to the buffet. A third or more of the buffet was empty and most of what was left was pretty unappetizing but we got what we could and went back to our table. Halfway through the meal some Naan showed up. It was ok. 

My husbands main complaint was the only meat at the buffet was dry chicken in various forms and everything else was pretty much a sauce, nothing solid. They did eventually open up a bit more of the buffet and refresh some of the dishes and I generally liked what I had at that point but everything he got was difficult to eat. Rubbery chicken from all directions. He actually ate more from the salad bar which is normally my domain. The biggest reason for the 1 star is halfway through his second plate the vent above him started dripping in his food... 

Overall the place was in disarray. We didn&#39;t have an actual server just several people that would walk by from time to time. We had to yell out at one of them to get our check which is a huge issue for me. When I&#39;m ready to leave, let me leave and a vent dripping in my husbands food is where I take my exit."

You definitely cannot fairly compare them to their Arvada location while they&#39;re still in the early stages of opening this facility. Part of the problem is that this location will never have the ambiance and character of the Arvada location, but seeing as they&#39;re obviously trying to capitalize on the event center aspect of this location I think they know that.

Seating around the buffet is nice, private booths but the seats could use upgraded padding as they are pretty worn. Service is pretty good, but could definitely be better, especially when the times comes for the bill. 

What I love most about this buffet, as others have mentioned is the variety and quantity of dishes- this buffet has more options than any other Indian buffet around that I&#39;ve been to. I&#39;m not particularly concerned about the number of vegetarian dishes, of which there are much more than other buffets in the area, but the overall variety and uniqueness of dishes compared to other Indian buffets. I&#39;m obsessed with their sweet potato tikka masala- so different and so yummy! They also have so many other unique dishes like an okra dish that was quite tasty as well. 

I like that they bring fresh naan to your table. They do a decent job keeping drinks full. And the buffet is a great value when you&#39;re looking for a little bit of everything, and you&#39;re really, really hungry."

We had a group of 4 adults and 3 young kids (4 year olds). We were the ONLY people in the entire restaurant and it is a big place. Now it was 6:30pm on a Wednesday night, but still, I expected at least one other person dining there. 

The waiter gave us about 10 mins to decide if we wanted anything to drink and another 10 mins to see if we were ready to order which wasn&#39;t a big deal. There were also 4 employees (pretty sure one was the owner) working. We all decided that we wanted chicken tikka masala. The ladies wanted mild and my cousin and I wanted medium. We also ordered 2 kids meals for my twins and my cousins daughter was only going to eat samosas. We also ordered 4 different orders of Naan. 

When the food came out after our appetizers we got 3 orders of Naan, one kids meal, 1 mild tikka masala and 2 medium tikka masalas. As we waited, the ladies shared until my wife&#39;s would come out. By the time the guys had finished eating our main dish, the waiter came back out and the ladies basically finished their shared dish (even though they ordered 1 each)

So to sum everything up... Service sucks... Food was average... Price was normal of what I would expect of this type of restaurant. I will also say that the tikka masala sauce was much more watery than other Indian restaurants I have been to. 

Glad we tried it to experience for ourselves, but won&#39;t be back here again."

We reserved the event room and were a party of fourteen. The service was excellent. Our waiter was extremely attentive, friendly, polite, and helpful. He very kindly took a picture of our group for us and even offered to take pictures with other cell phones. He was a gem. The manager was also great. He came to our tables to ask how everything was and gave our mom a yogurt lassi on the house in honor of her birthday. I&#39;m a stickler for service and was very impressed with their hospitality and wonderful service. 
Now for the food. We had the lunch buffet. I was impressed with the variety of dishes. There were three rices alone (white, saffron, and brown) and two soups. Of the soups I only tried the coconut milk soup and it was delicious. The food all tasted hot and freshly prepared. I sampled most of the dishes and every one was very tasty. The raita was an especially tasty companion to some of the spicier offerings. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal and I look forward to returning to The Yak and Yeti."

Our visit started with a rickety table, no menus, no drink menu and when the drinks arrived there was some black substance stuck to the outside of the glass. Eeew.  No Naan and then to top it off when we were at the buffet bar they came and cleared our table.  
A pretty building with a stale vibe.

I came here on a Saturday evening, right at 5pm (when the buffet is supposed to start) and we&#39;re greeted by someone who simply said &#34;2?&#34; With a flat face, walked us to the dark cardboard booth: then he asked if we were going to do the buffet, and when we said yes, he walked away. He returned with a drink menu after having to be asked, and then we headed to the buffet. 

As far as variety goes, it&#39;s pretty standard. But I was shocked at the quality of the food. The salad bar had no dressing,not that it was out, but there were no dresding options. All of the food was dried and overcooked, and the naan bread made me want to cry. Remember, this buffet just opened! But the food looked like it was made 5 days ago. This location is a disgrace compared to the perfection that is the Avada location

The branch on Hampden is beautiful and spacious with private, comfortable booths. The food is the same delicious fare as at their other locations.

I like to get the lunch buffet instead of ordering off the menu so I can experience as many flavors as possible. Haven&#39;t found an item yet that I don&#39;t like. 

The Nepalese side to Y&amp;Y dishes is what makes them unique. The sweet potato masala is a personal favorite  of mine. Also, the carrot pudding.

We were not asked if we wanted a cocktail or something to drink....I guess because there was water and two glasses on the table. I went to the front of the &#34;dining area&#34; and asked if there was a wine list....he pointed and said &#34;over there&#34;.

I used to drive by this event space every day and wonder... how does that place stay in business? Well, now that it&#39;s DELICIOUS Indian food, I&#39;m expecting the parking lot will be much busier.

We were seated and told to go ahead to help ourselves to the lunch buffet. I sampled veggie korma, saag paneer, tandoori chicken, curry chicken, and a couple other entree dishes. Served with your choice of saffron or jasmine rice. Plus, they bring piping hot naan to your table. I was feeling pretty darn fat and happy. (Personally, I like to smear the naan with a generous dollop of saag, then put rice on top of the saag, and then enjoy). There were also appetizers (chat) like samosas and pakora. Desserts included banana pakora (aka fritters).

Service was great, with magically appearing naan and refills on water. 

I would not hesitate to come back. Can we go now?"

We looked up the star rating on yelp and thought, this will work.

Upon walking in, the restaurant has a nice feel and on a rainy Tuesday night wasn&#39;t overcrowded or loud. Truthfully, the place is pretty unassuming but it&#39;s hiding a GIANT SECRET. You want to know don&#39;t you? Ok, I guess I can share it with you:  The sushi here is nothing short of AMAZING. On par with Sushi Den. Yup, I said it. 

Sure the prices are a little higher than that place around the corner that you always go to, but it is so worth it. As soon as the first piece of fish hits your tongue, you know they are using the highest quality freshest fish they can get their hands on.  You aren&#39;t going to see &#34;philadelphia&#34; or &#34;dragon&#34; rolls or any of that crazy Americanized stuff you normally order. Just great sashimi and nigiri and some creative yet simple rolls. The fish doesn&#39;t need anything crazy, it&#39;s the star of the show here. 
 
And the best part, no long wait to get in. Other positives are that they have a great cocktail menu. My boyfriend ordered a cucumber cocktail and loved it. Service was consistent, not overbearing.  Our water glasses were always filled and the server checked in with us regularly. I would say don&#39;t expect sushi to come out in an instant, I did notice a little bit of a wait after our order was placed which was fine as the presentation and rolls were excellent. Perfection takes time, right?

I think we&#39;ve found our new sushi spot in town. Totally worth a drive. And if the secret spreads across town and there ends up being a wait the next time we show up, we&#39;ll already know it&#39;s totally worth hanging around."

Memories of Sydney, Australia with a friendly casual style, clean lines and decor.  Open floor plan from outdoors to indoors.  Waiter (from Bloomington/Normal Il originally) was helpful though somehow recommended the highest priced items on the menu.  Hmmmm.  I asked if they had fresh wasabi and delighted the answer was yes!  So ask and you may receive. Enjoyed the Godzilla and Ronin rolls at waiter&#39;s recommendation.  Also a tofu appetizer that was a revelation of tofu silkiness.

Seeing Asian faces behind the sushi bar is always a good sign. Service was outstanding, with constant refills on water and perfectly timed food.

Even though the omakase (chef selected 7 course dinner) is the recommended way to go here, $85 per person is pretty steep, and we weren&#39;t crazy hungry. Will save that for a special occasion. 

They offer bento style dinners that include a combination of sushi, miso soup and a house salad. We went vegetarian, with an avocado and a pickled daikon maki roll, plus three pieces of veg nigiri (eggplant nigiri was ridic). All for under $15. Definitely recommend it. 

We also ordered a house special roll for $18. It was a good size and pretty good, but served with this chili garlic sauce that was totally unnecessary and did nothing for the roll. I would expect more Japanese (= clean) and less American (= saucy) style sushi in a place like this. 

All of their desserts, including the Filipino rice cake, include wheat flour, so if you&#39;re sensitive to gluten, you are S-O-L on sweets."

We sat at the sushi bar and got an education on the fish and history of some of the dishes from the head sushi chef. We loved everything he made for us. We especially enjoyed all the unique and fresh daily fish options on the daily menu.

Nice folks who know their stuff. Higher prices but worth it if you like to sample some of the more unusual selections. Had a truly special piece of toro and a very good uni which are a little hard to find in Denver. 

Excellent sake list. And close in quality of food to Sushi Sasa, Izakaya and Sushi Den. Service was good but not quite stellar. Would definitely go back. Was with a group of 10 or so and that&#39;s not really the way to try out a new sushi place. When we return we&#39;ll sit at the sushi bar which is what you should do.

Sign me,

Lots of delicacies like monkfish liver and combinations on the specials menu that you must try. Well prepare sushi that is fresh and a great happy hour. Quite a selection of beer and wine. It is small and very popular so get there early before the crowds to get a table.

What I appreciate about Sushi Ronin is that they aren&#39;t swamped yet. It&#39;s busy enough but doesn&#39;t leave me worried that we will be waiting hours for a table. I know that I can come at a peak time (Fri or Sat night) and wait no longer than 20 minutes before I&#39;m putting in my sushi order. That&#39;s a novelty in LoHi, folks."

Much smaller inside than I expected. Both bartenders were extremely friendly. Had only 2 rolls and hot sake. Special roll was great. Can&#39;t recall our other roll but a bit too much rice for my liking and not as flavorful as I&#39;m used to. Overall it seems like a good place but it really didn&#39;t wow me enough to want to go running back. Probably won&#39;t terurn"

I have been waiting to try it since it opened and finally made it there this past week.  

Sushi is passion of mine and I make a conscious effort to try all of the sushi places I can.  Being in a land locked state, it is sometimes hard to be adventurous.  Thanks to Yelp, we can filter out those sushi places we can skip and ones we must try! 

We originally came here for happy hour which is only offered on the fornt patio and the back bar.  The place is pretty small so this could fill up fast, however, when we came there was hardly anyone here. The HH was a compiled list of about 6 items that were all $5.  The choices were slim and the portions were small, even for five dollars.  We did enjoy lagers in a can, and these little shishito pepper bites wrapped in japanese eggplant.  However, there were three bites between the two of us. I wouldn&#39;t mark this down as the best happy hour in town.  

For our main dishes, we had a couple rolls and an assortment of sashimi.  I am a big fan or sashimi, especially when it is done right.  This was $35 and paired with a soup and salad which was all delicious. The sashimi itself was good for the most part, but some of it was not the freshest.  There was one fish that was rather mooshy. The rolls were excellent and not so dolled up with weird sauces that the mark was missed altogether.  

I would say overall it was tasty, but the pricing was equal or more than what I pay at Izakaya and Sushi Den who fly their fish in daily, and I would say it is better quality.  Cute place for the neighborhood, I just wouldn&#39;t drive out of my way to stop here."

While many claim Sushi Ronin is better than Denver&#39;s premier sushi star - Sushi Den - we didn&#39;t find it better but deliciously different. The vibe is very neighborhood casual and unpretentious. The wine list diverse and the cocktail list was interesting. Our party of four all opted for the omakase (7-course tasting chef selected menu). Every dish we had from oysters to dessert was creative, fresh and delicious. We definitely recommend adding Sushi Ronin to your Denver Sushi rotation!"

I was watching the sushi chef&#39;s and I noticed better quality fish going to regulars.  The service was good, friendly and attentive.  However very pricey for the quality of fish in the nigiri.   Even the sake was extremely over priced.  The Sayuri Nigori was 5 times the cost of a store bought bottle.  I think that might be way to much.  The miso soup seemed packaged.

Again the service was good,  however for the quality of fish,  this was over priced.  I&#39;ve been to other parts of Denver in cheaper neighborhoods with the same quality, but 30 percent cheaper."

Ambience and decor: Spot on! The decor, which I found out was completely Chef Corey Bakers vision, was hip without being too trendy. Beautiful hand painted koi fish roam the walls surrounded by carefully placed raised and textured wood paneling. The Samurai sword sitting behind the sushi chefs blends perfectly with the concept and name of Sushi Ronin. We ate at the sushi counter, which is an experience everyone should partake in, but we first got drinks at the bar. The bar is beautiful, a mixology dream stocked with everything from Japanese whiskey(of course) to Amaros and Mezcals.  

Drinks: We started with cocktails before moving on to sake. My wife got the Budo Nashi which is a pisco prosecco cocktail. Both pretty and delicious. I saw that they had amaro nonino so I grabbed my go to Paper Airplane and was not let down. Well balanced and delicious. I&#39;m not going to pretend to know a ton about sake but we were well directed and got a filtered and unfiltered, both delicious. 

Food: Wow! Wow! Wow! We sat in front of chef Baker and chose to do omakase. His knife skills are insane but I think what truly separates him are his plating and fusion skills. Every dish looks like a piece of art. You almost have to photograph it before you devour it. Every bite tastes better than the last. He plays with so many textures, colors and flavors. It&#39;s hard to describe everything we had because the Chef was choosing it but just look at the photos. I know from talking to him he&#39;s sourcing the fish and ingredients from the best places possible. 

Overall, I would go back hear again in a heartbeat. I&#39;ve lived in New York and LA and eaten at the best sushi joints in those cities. This is right on par with those. Get in now before it becomes like Nobu and you can&#39;t actually sit in front of Chef Baker.

Ps, the lady who said she had better sushi in Vegas is outside her mind haha that is all."

How this place has been open for 6 months without me having heard about it is beyond me. 

Ambiance: trendy but but over-done, tasteful environment, open front area with lots of light and air, a nice patio with a couple tables on cooler nights. Overall, it was pleasant but not pretentious. Music was fun and upbeat. Even a little hip hop at the end of the evening. 

Service: had a great server. Friendly and engaging and generally very responsive. We sat at the sushi  bar and enjoyed the back and forth with the sushi chefs and other staff. Very friendly. 

Food : this was the highlight. Cucumber and octopus salad was a tasty start, dinner salad was. Light ginger with mixed greens. Fish was fresh and delicious, the salmon melted in my mouth, striped bass had good flavor and texture, even the octopus was tender for octopus and the rolls were well made. Overall, the attention to detail and flavor were excellent 

Overall: this was a wonderful experience. We have already made plans to return and try the omakase. The folks next to us ordered it and we were envious as every dish was served. I have been to almost every great sushi restaurant in Denver and this is among the top 3--if not the best. Can&#39;t wait to go back."

Last night wiped all of that away. To say that we felt disrespected would be an understatement. The disjointed service, mute sushi chef, and inattentive staff left us confused and disappointed.

We hired a babysitter, drove out of our way to go to what we thought would be an incredible night. We cut our losses and closed out before our night was ruined further.

The tragedy is that they have incredible product, a talented head sushi chef, and a beautiful space with zero love for us as customers. 

Maybe they don&#39;t want my business. That&#39;s fine. Sushi Den will have my business going forward."

They all LOVE sushi and are always looking for great sushi. I took them hear because I had heard great things. All of the staff and owners here used to work at the Sushi Den and they started to start their own place. Well...they have hit a home run. Everyone with us said that it was the best sushi in Denver. Fresh. Creative. Tasty. I personally had a couple of the chicken dishes and found them to be great as well. AND I even tried some of the sushi (my kids took pictures to prove it) and actually liked it.

The sushi is excellent. The drinks were wonderful, unique. We were so taken by the drinks that we shared three:  Smokin Buddha, Geisha and Budo Nashi. Inventive, balanced, beautiful. The best drinks in Denver. We also had the matcha dessert (like matcha tiramisu) and it was lovely- and adult dessert that was not too sweet.  

We will be back!"

We visited on a Sunday evening for my husband&#39;s birthday, and the place was quiet. The staff was attentive and answered our questions about rolls and made good recommendations. We got specialty cocktails (Sensei &amp; Smoking Buddha) and shared five rolls between us. We took a few pieces home because it was quite filling. 

Our next visit will be during a Happy Hour, so we can try more options for less money.  Our bill for the night was typical for sushi in Denver, but we didn&#39;t do any starters or non-sushi options that all looked delicious I around us.  My on my complaint would be some of the staff appropriating Japanese culture who were clearly not Japanese.  It is just not something I can appreciate as an Asian woman in a city with a small Asian population."

Very fresh and unique rolls. 

Be aware that it is spendy, but you get what you pay for. 

The only thing I would suggest is the person bringing out each roll recounting what is in it. We ordered quite a few in our group and ended up guessing what was in each."

Never even knew it existed, but I am not a frequent Denver Downtown person.  I do have a favorite sushi place near home, but this is a different place all together.  I can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called, but I &#34;stepped out&#34; and tried the special 7 course chef&#39;s choice - it was not a mistake.  I experienced some tastes and textures in sushi that I am not familiar with, most were fabulous and the couple of bite I had that didn&#39;t really excite me I am sure would excite others.  It&#39;s kind of like a wine tasting in sushi, and not everyone likes the same wines!

The staff was very personable and knowledgeable about the products they are offering.  I agree with the previous review - not the regular sushi - but instead different and very worth the trip.  I would expect to be making more trips just to try out new dishes and experience whatever the chef can &#34;throw at me&#34;, and if you knew my usual eating habits - you&#39;d be surprised at me saying that.

I would not hesitate to recommend this to friends, with the caveat that if all you want is a california roll and other standard items, probably best to &#34;stay at home&#34;, but if you&#39;re looking for some awesome sushi, really good and creative new options included - go here!"

Many of the workers there came with him from Sushi Den. We sat at the sushi bar so we had a prime view of the chefs at work. We were brought a hot towelette and cucumber/octopus starter. Then onto some nasu shishito, a thinly sliced piece of japanese eggplant wrapped around a fried shishito pepper. We tried the colorado roll, ronin roll and avo roll and all were excellent. We also ordered the cha soba - green tea buckwheat noodles in a mentsuyu sauce. This was not at all what I was expecting as the noodles were cold and we were a little confused as to how to go about this dish but our great server Kevin (or Billy) showed us the way - dip the noodles into the sauce and it&#39;s not soup so don&#39;t drink the sauce :) We were definitely out of our element as you can tell! It will definitely be great during the summer when the windows will be open to the outdoor seating. An intimate place, clean and modern design. A bit pricey so that would be my only negative.

I absolutely loved the ronin roll. The service was also great. Got some great suggestions, and the food came super quick. Every plate was presented beautifully. Also, just want to add this Joshua L guy who gave one star is a complete douche bag. For him to give one star based on inattentive service and a sushi chef who wasnt talking is stupid. Maybe he was having a bad day, or smelled your douche bag vibes. Your review should be based on more than that considering the incredible experience you had before.

We had the Omakase and I can&#39;t imagine going any other way after this experience. Let me describe it:

1st- Invigorating. The first few courses were standouts. Freshly cut mackerel, lightly grilled scallop, fresh hamachi belly, fresh salmon, all served with accompaniments like pickled wasabi, ginger flowers, ginger leaves, etc. the accompaniments that were provided for each dish were personable and individualistic to the tee and absolutely complimentary to the fish but stood on their own.

2nd- Playful. Hamachi grilled ribs. Vietnamese poached black cod. This cod was one of the most moving and complex dishes I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Sweet umami. I have never had sweet umami, but that dish was it. Try to understand it. I have never been so moved by the subtle yet vibrant flavors that happened on these plates. We had a &#39;huevos rancheros&#39; style nigiri tonight with tuna and quail egg, let alone the pieces that finished us off which were a cod&#39;s roe and salmon piece flamed to perfection and finished with caviar. 

3rd- Humble. What an incredible way to come out of a sushi/sashimi experience. To feel like you were taken on a culinary adventure is to say the least. I feel like I have a mild education on how these fish, vegetables, and fruits were supposed to be eaten. I know most people feel like you &#39;overpay&#39; for sushi/sashimi. I feel like I got every cent&#39;s worth.

Also, I have never been satisfied by a Japanese/sushi dessert. We had a green tea cake that blew every other cake I&#39;ve ever had out of the water. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re still doing reading this review. Go eat there now. It is perfect."

The place is amazing-great environment, friendly staff, and the food is superb. The best seats in the house are at the bar where you can watch the chefs work their magic and show off their skills. 
If it&#39;s true that love is in the details then this place is filled to the brim. Each plate is presented exquisitely and almost looks too good to touch. Top quality all the way around !!!

I came at happy hour (5-6pm) and they were offering great deals on their food. I ordered eel sushi (not on happy hour menu) and then everything else I got off the happy hour menu: 2 different hand rolls and fried chicken. The sushi was extremely fresh-tasting. The hand rolls were fresh and delicious. The fried chicken was melt-in-your-mouth good! The wait staff were extremely attentive and friendly. I would absolutely return here and it is probably the best sushi I have had so far in Denver!

We learned a few things from our server and look forward to our next visit for further exploration into the art form of sushi. Also from the bar a terrific Suijin dry sake and one of the premium drinks featuring assorted liqueurs was delicious - I sipped it for half the meal!

Half the cooked rolls arrive lukewarm, the nigiri is ok quality. Living in LA and Vegas I have had the opportunity to eat some of the best sushi and this place made me disgusted especially when they can charge you two or three times the amount the sushi is really worth.  With all the super current sushi restaurants in the Denver area, I would&#39;ve expected a late comer to really hit the ball out of the stadium. Not so.  Don&#39;t waste your money.

First off, I&#39;m a Veteran and they gave free meals away on Veteran&#39;s Day....including their most expensive entree (a very tasty Knob Creek Sirloin Steak). A lot of places make a special menu with cheaper entrees for events like this, but these guys went all out. I&#39;m grateful.

Plus, the wait staff was incredibly friendly and answered all our questions. We ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower (amazing and cheap), Fried Chicken (best thing on the menu) and their steak (tasty!). 

Cool environment with TVs that aren&#39;t annoyingly loud, cool bar and patio, and some really large booths. And, it&#39;s very affordable. I&#39;m happy we live within 5 minutes. We&#39;ll be back often!

Thanks so much, WTF!"

The staff was super nice and friendly, pretty quick with the service, etc. 

Atmosphere wise, well it&#39;s a bro-cloud, so many bros. Thankfully they seem to mostly sleep in so weekend brunch is quite nice. 

Not a dig on the space, food is good everything is great, I suspect anything in this Bermuda Triangle of bro apartments, would have this issue.

Churro Waffles, amazing, sadly not made of churros. :( I enjoyed the hell out of them, but will try something else next time."

The experience was a fantastic one, from the drinks on tap to the bottles and cans to the food. It was awesome to have a little late night spot to grab drinks or food. First night we came in here pretty late and went to the upstairs bar and thanks to our great bartender got some great recommendations on some local brews. 

We decided to eat here on Sunday before we headed to Riot Fest. The girl that was working the downstairs bar was super cool. Very great service and some great conversation. I ordered the open face braised beef, it was fantastic. Very rich and the arugula was a perfect addition to it.  My girl grabbed the tuna bahn mi which packs a nice kick as it gets a little spicy if you are a wimp. If you are thinking about a side, just get the brussel sprouts they are not to be over looked. We actually came back for a late night snack after the show and got some pig wings. They are a very good appetizer and great for sharing. Check this out if you are a fan. 

Overall a good spot that offers a nice variety of whiskey if that is your thing. Reminds me a place that is by my work back home in Orang County. If you are a local in Denver and have not checked this spot out, I would get over here and try some of the food. It will not dissappoint. CHEERS!!"

Their shrimp and grits are honestly the best I&#39;ve ever had. I am from the south and find that there tends to be a huge variation in the dish... In my opinion and given my taste, these are the best. The green chili grits are buttery, cheesy and slightly spicy and just have a wonderful flavor profile and texture. The cajun shrimp are large and really well spiced. There&#39;s a cheddar frico which offers a really nice variation in texture and a cheesy, salty crunch. Also, there was Imbrico chorizo sausage and a sunny side up egg to top it off. I just loved it. period. 

My friends have gotten the chicken waffle and sunrise sammy, which were both great as well.

Their drinks are great as well. I loved the bloody mary and also have gotten the unlimited mimosas, which is always a phenomenal decision. 

I hope to come back for dinner some time! 

Try this place."

Very attentive bartender mixed with an eclectic atmosphere was a great dining experience. The fried chicken was recommended and it was so tasty. The glaze that they make to go over the crispy chicken thigh makes for a sweet &amp; savory twist on the classic dish. TRY THE buffalo cauliflower. I was skeptical at first of this dish but my adventurous traveling partner encourage me to tried them and I am SO Glad i did. The cauliflower is deep fried and covered in buffalo hot wing sauce and it is surprisingly crispy and flavorful. You honestly forget that it is cauliflower. The drinks were crafted well and the pricing is reasonable. Defiantly a nice lunch or dinner spot in Denver."

Tonight I got the poblano chile rilleno and Brussels sprouts. It was absolutely delicious and came out extremely fast. 

I love that the bar is open. The breeze feels great and the people watching can be pretty entertaining too. 

As the name suggests, they specialize in whiskeys but are able to cater to different tastes. I&#39;m more of a beer person so I typically go for the lilikoi white or the princess yum yum, a raspberry kolsch. Both are very light and a little fruity, perfect for summer. 

WTF is definitely one of my favorite places in Denver."

She always raves about it so I thought I&#39;d try it since she mentioned they just updated their menu. I got there a little bit before her and there were 2 other people in there. It was really quiet in there. So I could hear the jams they were piping through the speakers. Anytime you play soul music or Motown, you have my heart. So I was pleasantly surprised just right there. 

After having a mini dance sesh in my seat, I looked over their fabulous drink menu. We are allowed to drink on our lunch break at work and so I said why not? The server told me that they have over 115 whiskeys to chose from. 

I ordered my whiskey neat. I&#39;ve had trouble ordering it this way at several different places around Colorado. I guess people don&#39;t know what a True whiskey neat is. These guys do. I am slightly disappointed in our server&#39;s attitude while explaining the difference. She was a little uppity about it. I mean I know Whiskey is in the name of your restaurant and you have over 100 from your selection, but you don&#39;t need to be snooty when explaining this to your customers. Especially when you make your living on service. 

I will give it up to them on presentation. They severed the whiskey beautifully and they accompanied it by a freshly made salted caramel. (See photo) My friend and I ordered the shrimp and grits for lunch. The flavor of the shrimp was tasty and the grits were cooked well. The portion size was nice too. It&#39;s one of their new menu items and I definitely think they should keep it.

I enjoyed my time at Whiskey. I&#39;m sure I will be back to try again and maybe they can be bumped up to 5 stars."

BACON, BACON, BACON, BACON, BACON, BACON AND MORE BACON PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!

The staff from when they opened to now, is like night and day (so much better!!).  I enjoy stopping in to say hi to some of the bartenders.   Adam and Zach are always nice and helpful.  They take the time to chat with you while working, which makes people feel appreciated.  I love bacon.  Happy hour specials are really good.  I love bacon.  I have been to a ladies whiskey tasting event and had a really great time.  Not sure if you are aware, I love bacon.  

Food is very good.  This place just needs bacon, with extra bacon, a side of bacon and topped off with more bacon.  I can&#39;t think of how many times we walk past Whiskey Tango Foxtrot wishing they had bacon.  Nothing goes better with whiskey than a nice side of bacon.  Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a Saturday or Sunday morning is awesome.  

Also, could we possibly get chambord?  I love to put in a mimosa.  I don&#39;t care how much a shot of chambord will cost, I just want to put it in my mimosa.  There are a few cocktails you can mix with chambord.  I read it on the internet, so its obviously true.  

Back to bacon.  Please reconsider the decision of leaving bacon off the menu.  It not nice to treat bacon this way.  

What has bacon done to you?

Love,

Katie aka Katie Bacon"

We ordered the fried chicken and tuna banh mi. I open the box with the fired chicken, and, holy mother of all men do I weep with joy. Perfectly juicy, dark meet chicken, with the perfect sweet and salty crispy shell. I literally licked the box clean. The sriracha blends with the syrup in a devilishly Devine coating for a plate you could eat with your hands. 

AND THIS IS DELIVERY, FOLKS, THIS AIN&#39;T STRAIGHT OUTTA THE OVEN

I&#39;M TALKING 10/10, DENVER WINS THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP OF FOOD WITH THIS DISH

And meanwhile my girlfriend is eating a tuna banh mi. What a wonderful selection - fish, spice, fresh cilantro. All on a fresh loaf. 

Jesus Christ could flake on our lunch date and I would be less disappointed. I&#39;m not saying that the bread was the worst I&#39;ve ever had, but let&#39;s just say it&#39;s top.... one. And I have to watch my girlfriend eat this and... I mean, I love her, so we switch dishes half way through.

WTF is great. If you haven&#39;t been here yet, you&#39;ll be thinking to yourself &#34;WTF haven&#39;t I been here before?!&#34; 

The fried chicken will make you want to forget that you&#39;ve ever considered a diet. 

The ice cream sandwich I&#39;m told is good enough that to get your fix, you might steal one from a little kid and shamelessly eat it from while standing on top of their table where they couldn&#39;t reach you to kick your shins. That and the extensive, delicious, and inviting beverage menu are both reasons I would not recommend bringing kids. 

(WARNING: IF YOU DO HAVE TO STEAL ONE FROM A KID, THEY HAVE STICKY FINGERS AND TOES AND ARE COMPLETELY CAPABLE OF CLIMBING THE TABLE TO GET TO YOU, SO THIS IS HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU CAN EAT IT REALLY REALLY QUICKLY.)

I personally haven&#39;t had the ice cream sandwich yet. After not being able to stop myself from finishing the fried chicken and subsequently licking the plate, I just didn&#39;t have room. At least I&#39;ve left myself something else to come back for aside from the astute service (Julie was one of the best servers that I&#39;ve had anywhere downtown in quite a while), convenient location, and comfy/open environment with a small neighborhood vibe.

I would very highly recommend checking it out for yourself......and not stealing ice cream from little kids......unless of course they&#39;re your own kids."

I guess I&#39;ll have to stop here more frequently once I make the move to Denver.  This was a pit stop for us to start the night but it was my favorite stop of our crusade.

It was a Monday evening and we all stopped here for a quick pre game drink plus some eats while watching the Packers &amp; Chiefs duel it out on MNF.  I ordered the hazelnut brown nectar beer for my drink.  Smooth with a tootsie roll flavor finish.  For food, I got the fries and cheese curds.  Some of the best cheese curds I&#39;ve ever had and the fries weren&#39;t bad either.  I couldn&#39;t order anything else since we had to meet some other friends at this other place that wasn&#39;t anywhere as good as this one.

I just browsed the online menu before reviewing and they have a nice selection of drinks including alcoholic milkshakes and a nice whiskey selection.  They have Buffalo Trace, one of my favorite Kentucky bourbon-whiskeys, not sure why other places don&#39;t have it.  Oh that&#39;s right, this is a whiskey bar!  It makes sense now.  Anyways kudos to them for carrying it plus the local whiskers like Stranahans.

As soon as I move to Denver, I&#39;ll be at this spot as much as I can.  Just thinking about it makes me crave it already.  I&#39;ll be back Foxtrot!"

Just left here for the last time. 

We ordered generically, when he finally took our drink order, and he didn&#39;t acknowledge happy hour. I asked for his recommendation of an IPA, there were two on happy hour. He dropped drinks, never saw him again until drinks and glasses were empty.

No happy hour 2 for 1s ever showed up, but there was a $7.25 IPA on the cheque. When I mentioned with the cheque that this bums me out, he argued, said that happy hour IPA sucks, and acted like a real jerk. He flung a happy hour token at me, I said no thanks I&#39;ll never be back, my friends jaws were agape.

Arrived about 1645 on 8/3/16, sat in a booth near bar, 3 of us. Asian Salad, Power Salad, Open Face Beef Sandwich, White Ale, Trago Adio, and not a Titan or Goose IPA. Please correct your server.  Thank you.

We made a reservation because we want to make sure we can get in when we&#39;re enjoying our time together.  It took a while for us to be acknowledged, much less seated.  They finally came by and told us we could sit at the bar.  We told them we had a reserved space and that&#39;s where we wanted to sit.  We were seated and that was great, but it did take a few more minutes to get the waiter to wait on us.  The waiter was wonderful and informative once we were taken care of.

The whiskey flights were delicious.  The food was just as wonderful.  The fried chicken did not disappoint!  The homemade ice cream sandwich was a great end to the evening.

Unfortunately, I moved shortly after they were brought back. However, I made sure to go a few times before I left. I know this is a whiskey place, but how about a drink or two with tequila? Whenever I ask the bartender to make me something with tequila they kind of give me a weird look. A few times I was made a tequila sunrise, then I asked for one a different time and was told grenadine is not something they have at this bar.....how? However, the other times I had a tequila sunrise there was grenadine in it. Weird. I miss this place."

This place has plenty of parking because it&#39;s next to a garage that allows free customer parking. The entrance isn&#39;t obvious because there are no restaurant windows in the front. The space is dim with loud music but in a very swanky man-pad kind of way. They played x-games on 2 of their three TVs &amp; they played alternative/indie music. Brunch ends @ 1PM. I ordered fried chicken thigh with pickles and a dipping sauce from the lunch menu. The chicken was very tasty and crunchy. It wasn&#39;t too salty. The pickles were way too sweet for me. I didn&#39;t use much of the dip because the chicken was already flavorful enough. I couldn&#39;t finish my chicken because two large fried thighs is pretty heavy. The server was helpful but not particularly pleasant. I don&#39;t think I saw her smile once. My group tried the cookie dough ice cream sandwich &amp; the red velvet waffle with berry compote &amp; vanilla ice cream. The red velvet waffle was very soft &amp; tasted like vanilla. The compote was nice &amp; not too sweet.

On a 2nd occasion, I came here and tried a gin cocktail with egg white, Jalapeno cheese curds and sushi tacos. I didn&#39;t care for the sushi tacos because I thought it was too sweet from all the fruit that was in it but the cocktail was really delicious and beautiful. I also tried a whiskey cocktail with a square ice cube in it. It was too strong for me but the bf enjoyed it. The jalapeno cheese curds were really spicy and too greasy but overall tasted great."

Nothing was opened and we were told by another bar to come here to get something to eat. This place wasn&#39;t bumping but it had a small crowd going. Me and my friend decided to order a drink to wait for our meal. We order the Foxhatten and the Breckenridge. I never had whisky before since I just turned 21 that Sunday. So this was the first place I ordered my first drink and it was strong yet delicious. We both order the Whiskey Tango Burger and an order of fries. I am going to say it was the best burger I had in Denver so far.  The fries were nice and crispy as well. The service was great and bartender was friendly. The atmosphere in the place was chill and it&#39;s definitely a place I&#39;m going to be coming back again on my next trip.

The beau and I met up here with a friend for happy hour to watch the final game of the Women&#39;s World Cup. I was pregnant at the time, so I asked for a root beer, which was supposed to be on tap from Tommy Knocker. But, they ran out and I only got half a glass. The Beau ordered a draft beer, and, that too was out. Then, the food we ordered was way heavier than advertised, even for bar fare. 

But, this story gets better. I recently returned for brunch, and it was delicious. I love that there is parking in the back, and that even at prime brunching time on Saturday, there wasn&#39;t a wait. I ordered the shrimp and grits. The grits were made super velvety by the cheese, and had a nice kick thanks to the green chiles. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles, and, while the waffle was a little soggy, the fried chicken was among the best I&#39;ve ever had!

I&#39;ll definitely be back for brunch and to give happy hour another try."

Why would a vodka loving girl like myself come here? Because it is almost the only game in town anywhere close to the restaurant I chose to celebrate my birthday this year.  Otherwise, i would probably not have every entered this establishment. 

First of all, parking is a bitch. There are a zillion residential apartment buildings here and all of the streets are 2 hr limit until 10pm. There is a parking garage that is free (I think) but it is not obvious.

There are two entry ways. I came in the door by the street and it was a little confusing about seating (seat yourself or wait to be seated). I saw my friend seated at a table at the front, and we decided to relocate because it was a super tight squeeze (in the front of the house). We asked and were told we could take any open table. We seated ourselves at a cute banquette style booth.

Service was friendly, but inconsistent. The main server got me a sample of the cider on tap (my only option since I don&#39;t particularly like whiskey) and I tried the honeycrisp apple wheat AND LIKED IT. We ordered some snacks as well, since drinking on an empty stomach is not so smart. I asked about the special (tostones) which the server was unaware was available. We ordered brussels and cheese curds too. I finally order tostones and request that they not garnish with parsley or cilantro. &#34;No problem, I&#39;ll take care of you&#34; said the waiter. So I was displeased when the bowl of tostones came out with plenty of parsley/cilantro. 

Summary:
1) Inconsistent service. Sometimes we waited a really long time for water or to pay our bill. I noticed the servers talking in the hallway. I get that they need to communicate, but maybe don&#39;t do it in plain sight or like you&#39;re all just hanging out.
2) Difficult parking unless you can find the parking garage.
3) great selection of drafts, i&#39;m assuming awesome whiskey. 
4) some different bar snacks than your typical bar. Crispy brussels, cheese curds, etc."

I wasn&#39;t really sure what to expect since the menu was kind of all over the place, and a bit small. My boyfriend can be tough to please, so I was just hoping for the best. 

It&#39;s kind of off the beaten path, but located near a few other restaurants I had been wanting to try. We had no trouble parking, and were seated immediately. My boyfriend ordered an old fashioned to start. It&#39;s his favorite drink, and he&#39;s had so-so luck in finding restaurants that can make a good one. Our waiter suggested he try a different type of rye (I think...this was over a week ago and I&#39;m not known for my brilliant memory) and my boyfriend loved it. 

I got the ahi bahn mi, and my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken. Our food came out super fast, which was good because we were short on time to make our movie. My sandwich was very simple, but every ingredient was excellent. The fried chicken was perfect and the honey really made it. 

We loved the screens on the walls with random history and trivia. The decor was very fitting, and the basket of root beer barrel candy was a nice touch. I took more than I probably should have. Sorry, guys. Can&#39;t wait to come back though! Maybe for pajama brunch? Or maybe dinner again when I have time to order dessert. Those cookie dough ice cream sandwiches looked so good."

The Whiskey French Toast is probably the BEST french toast I&#39;ve ever had in my life. So I guess I&#39;d say it&#39;s best for brunch, from my experience. Lunch/Dinner was all right, but not more than one or two entree options for a vegetarian.
My main complaint is - why are there always FLIES everywhere? I mean everywhere. The first time we ate there we had to move inside because of the gross amount of flies on the patio, but then quickly realized the inside isn&#39;t much better. Flies everywhere, constantly shoo-ing them away from our food and drinks. Second time we went....still flies. Lots of them. It honestly made my appetite decrease a great deal.
So, not sure where all the flies are coming from, but it&#39;s not very pleasant to eat around. If WTF can sort that issue out, I&#39;d be a customer much more often."

For our appetizer we ordered the pork meatballs.  Four delicious meatballs with green chili and queso fresco cheese on top.  I highly recommend.  Followed with the fried chicken.  A different take on a classic.  Loved it.

The first time, just 6 weeks after they opened, was lovely! The rooftop is beautiful and perfect for catching some sun with friends. There is not, however, any shaded areas so when the summer sun roles around, it will be HOT (I actually got sunburned during the two hours we sat there.)

The fried chicken was delicious, it has a thick breading (think chicken strip style) and the chicken had no bone. Different and delicious! As an avid whiskey drinker, the whiskey selection is good, some good staples and some other fun, more unknown whiskeys. My favorite part during the first experience was the presentation of whiskey and the service. Our whiskey came on this beautiful custom made whiskey board, with separate spots for whiskey, water and your glass. To top it off, it comes with a house made caramel! It was the best whiskey presentation I had ever received at  a bar. On top of that, the servers were great and the manager came by to chat with us all about the opening of the place.

Here&#39;s the sad part...I met friends for drinks two other times since then and....not so great. Both times the service was really slow, just for ordering whiskey. Then even more sadly, we did not get the amazing whiskeys boards or caramels on either one of my visits. The experience and presentation here are really what sold me. Honestly if I hadn&#39;t had a great 1st experience I would probably have given 3 stars...so my only hope is that they don&#39;t get lazy with their service. I truly hope they keep up the unique experience or this place will just be ho-hum to me."

I was down to go to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot after a Cubs game at Coors Field. I am always amazed at how much they are building that area behind the field up. I was excited to try a new place.

First it was a super easy walk from union station, coors field, and the surrounding areas so there&#39;s not excuse not to hike it over.  Upon arrival it looked like a pretty sweet joint. Modern, Rustic, and Hip. They have a small patio on the sidewalk with a full restaurant seating on the main floor which is dimly lit in a cool mysterious way.  The upstairs is a really fun and vibrant patio bar. The whole atmosphere really get an A+ from me. If I were to open my own restaurant/bar this is exactly how I imagined it.

They also have plenty of TVs on the roof for sports viewing.

So now my hopes are high and my tummy is grumbling. The menu is simple and carefully selected. I opted for a milkshake and the balsamic brussel sprouts.  Both were delicious but hands down the best brussel sprouts I&#39;ve EVER had. They were beautiful in color, a gorgeous crisp to the outside, and the tangy flavor of the brussel sprout was perfectly paired with the sweet balsamic reduction. I could seriously eat this every day, a must try! 

They have a great selection of beers including many local breweries. Along with a cocktail list and traditional drinks like whiskey.

Everyone at our table raved about the meals they ordered. Everything looked delicious. I saw a couple of the house fried chicken go by to another table and it was enough to make me drool. I will definitely be back to try that.

All around this is a really nice place to go with friends since they have large fun tables, or in a smaller setting, or to go and shame eat alone because everything looked so delicious! It&#39;s a great hang out spot, after the game drink, somewhere to retreat on a hot day, and/or great place for a date or to get to know someone.  The possibilities are endless!

My only concern is that once the word really gets out about this place it will be crowded since it&#39;s not huge....but totally worth the wait and hassle if it comes to that. It is also a tad pricey but worth every penny.

See you there!"

What a fun event! I definitely would never have known about WTF if it weren&#39;t for Yelp (thank you Frances G for posting about the event in the talk threads!), and I am so glad that I did.

The tasting was great. They paired the selection of Colorado whiskeys with a plate of fruit, and I was very surprised how the different fruits brought out different flavors in the whiskey. For starters we had Double Diamond whiskey from Downslope Distilling paired with strawberries, blueberries, red and yellow raspberries, and figs. Second, Breckenridge Bourbon with Ranier cherries, Bing cherries, pluots, and plums. Finally, Dancing Pines Bourbon with a variety of apples and pairs. 

During the tasting, the establishment&#39;s owner talked (at length) about whiskey. It was pretty dry. He went on and on about how distilling works and the legal requirements that make, say, a bourbon a bourbon or a scotch a scotch. Knowing that his audience were women, he was definitely talking down to us and consistently referred to whiskey as &#34;your grandfather&#39;s drink.&#34; As if a beverage could be masculine or feminine! He even felt that he had to answer very beginner questions that no one was asking, like what &#34;proof&#34; means. Okay, if you&#39;re experienced enough to appreciate a whiskey, neat, then you DEFINITELY know what &#34;proof&#34; means by now! He should have been talking about the flavors of the liquor, how to taste it properly, and why the particular fruits change the flavor in particular ways. Anyway, once you got past the blatant sexism of the whole thing, it was actually pretty fun! Overall, very delicious and informative.

I was truly impressed by the quality of the people who work at WTF. I personally met the owner (who is really a very nice man, despite the (probably unintentional) sexist remarks), the manager, the social media coordinator, and lots of other people. The waitstaff is FANTASTIC - prompt, friendly service; and they&#39;re always looking around to see if anyone needs anything. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming, they really enhanced the experience. I can&#39;t say enough good things about them!

Speaking of the people, the best part of the tasting was when the chef came out to talk about her pairing choices. I wish she had spoken more, because I really enjoyed hearing from her and felt she could have gone into greater detail. But she did briefly describe the whiskeys, the fruit, and how they went together. I wanted more of that!

The next parings will be Kentucky bourbon and chocolate, then scotch and cheese. They sound so fun. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to make it (Denver is a long drive on a weekday for me), but I&#39;m going to try! If anyone else is interested in this tasting series, stop deliberating and buy your tickets now, it&#39;s totally worth it.

Oh, as a side note: I got to WTF a little early for the event and hand&#39;t had the chance to grab dinner, so I ordered the tuna bahn mi sandwich to share with my friend. If you come here, GET THIS SANDWICH. It is so good!! After the tasting my friend and I stuck around to try more of the menu items, so we shared an order of the Brussels sprouts and split a fried fish sandwich. We came to the conclusion that this bar has a fantastic, restaurant-quality kitchen. Yum yum yum, I would order all of these things again in a heartbeat!"

She took forever to serve us, it was two friends birthdays and she was very snappy. She forgot one of my orders then continued to tell me that I didn&#39;t order it. Not impressed.  I was here on Trivia night a few weeks ago and the server was pretty good. Brunch was good but both times in the evening haven&#39;t had a great experience with the bartenders."

I LOVE the location and the ambiance inside.  It is dimly lit and there is an amazing bar that wraps around the entire side of the restaurant. They have an awesome buy one get one happy hour on drinks only (which come on... half the reason for happy hour is cheap bites).  However, they give you this cute little stamped penny (like they used to have at casa bonita) and it is good for your second drink.  So if you don&#39;t need it that night be sure to bring it in on your next visit! 

We enjoyed the charcuterie and the brussel sprouts. Both were tasty but not my favorite from around town.  The charcuterie had two meats that were almost like bologna which was very strange.  However, the cheese was awesome.  Great selection and we enjoyed those the most. There was a goat cheese and one that was sliced and looked semi boring but really brought bold flavor. We licked that side of the platter clean.  The brussel sprouts were okay, being the brussel sprouts goddess that I am.  They could kick up the seasoning a bit but they were cooked just right. I probably wouldn&#39;t order them again. 

I had a hard cider that was not too sweet and it is actually one of my new favorite drinks.  It was served in a goblet and just refreshing enough after a long day at work."

Took my lady friend out for drinks and a bite to eat. Kind of a seat yourself scenario, so we walk through and we were greeted very professionally upon our arrival. During the visit our server maintained contact making sure we&#39;re okay, and noticing things we might need with out us having to ask. 
So we get some grub, I had heard legend of the chicken here so I went with that, a server brings out our food and it looks great. We dig in and she comes by to make sure we are doing okay and notices I got the chicken sandwich not dinner plate. I would have never noticed, I was stoked either way. Instead of just staying quiet about it she let me know, she handled this as a professional, offered me what I ordered or she&#39;d comp my Sammy. So I got a free Sam and she got a great tip.

Was in the area because of work and it&#39;s freaking hot out so definitely needed to come in and have a delicious drink. 

Whiskey is my favorite and I&#39;ve had my eye on stopping by WTF for a while so I was super happy that I was right across the street from it. 

Had the the delicious foxtail called a tall glass of water. Colorado peach whiskey is the best. Perfect drink for summer! 

I had lunch right before I came in but decided to go with the roasted Brussels sprouts. They were perfect and the flavors with the balsamic were great. 

I decided to take a seat at the bar. Eli was a great bartender and I&#39;m very excited to have more amazing and delicious adventure at WTF!

Even for a non-whiskey gal like myself, the bartenders know their way around a tasty cocktail. Based off my interests, the bartender curated a perfectly delightful concoction that converted me into a whiskey drinker. So, already I am customer that&#39;s likely to return. Then the food arrived...

Where to even begin? Well, there is the fried chicken with the honey siracha glaze, the wonderfully crispy brussels sprouts, or the smoke salmon crostini. Given the choice, I&#39;d go with every one of them. Just too hard of a choice. The smoked salmon was fresh and served with the softest yet crispiest crostinis. Buttery but not too much, and toasted just right - not to the level of tooth-chipping. I know it seems odd to spend so much detail describing a crostini, but I feel it&#39;s hard to find the perfect crostini consistency like this, and I want the world to know!

Everything on the limited but quality menu is actually quite delectable and definitely something to enjoy along with your whiskey cocktail just for you, or with the numerous beers they have on tap. The pajama brunch is also something to look into. Pajama-wearing guests score a free drink! A free drink in their industrial-influenced atmosphere with a rooftop expansive patio, and tons of flat screens, too boot - what&#39;s not too like!?"

We called ahead to see if they would play the game we wanted, took 5 or 6 times asking bartenders and waiters to put it on. Finally half way through the game a manager finally puts our game on the smallest tv available.

My review is for the service, not the drinks, decor, or food.

I went at about 6p on a Saturday night hoping to have a drink or two, not dinner. The hostess met my group (of 3) at the door. When we told her we didn&#39;t want dinner and just wanted to sit at the bar, she told us the bar was crowded and we couldn&#39;t. We asked about an open high-top in the bar area, and she told us we couldn&#39;t take it, as someone else was using it. I didn&#39;t see anyone at the table, but ok? Then we told her we saw an open spot at the bar and she told us they didn&#39;t allow standing in the bar area. There was a spot to sit, only one of us would be standing, the spot was towards the side of the bar, and there were at least 10 people standing around the bar.

Throughout the exchange, she was very rude and spoke to us in a tone that told us she was annoyed to have us there. As the first point of contact we had with WTF, she gave us a bad impression of the place and caused us to leave without having a drink.

Based on the pictures my fellow Yelpers post, the place looks cool and it sounds like the food is good. But, Denver has a lot of cool places with rooftop patios, good food and friendlier staff. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll go back after that exchange stained my idea of WTF."

It&#39;s the perfect spot on a nice day but I get the feeling it&#39;ll become ridiculously packed once baseball season is in full swing (pun intended).

I heard so much about the fried chicken so I had to get it and, guess what? It might have been the best fried chicken I&#39;ve had at a restaurant, and this was literally days after I returned from Atlanta where they have some of the best in the country! 

The whiskey glasses and wooden holders are really cool. I don&#39;t drink it but people I was with do and they raved about the glasses but also the selection of whiskey. I actually had a shake which was good but nothing out of this world.

Good WTF: Oooo, now I get the name.  I see what you did there...
Bad   WTF: Website is just a sign that says &#34;now open&#34;... no menu? Whack. 

Good WTF: Patio is pretty damn nice on a nice day.
Bad   WTF: Server came by to take drink orders... no champagne for mimosas. (I typically don&#39;t like mimosas, but other people I was with did, so...booooo.)

Good WTF: Extensive drink menu including - japanese whiskeys, good mixology of bourbons, and a suprising beer selection.  (Note that they even had Goose Island Bourbon County Stout... which my friend told me is hard to get even in Chicago?!  They only release limited supply in Chicago in the winter... So it was surprising that they had it in Denver in the middle of May.)
Bad   WTF: Service was laggy even though the place was only like 40% full.

Good WTF: The food was impressive for a place that fashioned itself as a bar first.  
::The wings had a nice glaze without losing crispiness.  
::The french toast was SPECTACULAR.  It was made on french baguette (not brioche) which looked a little weird, but put out a crispy/chewy texture that was exhilarating. The sweetness of the dish was counteracted by the saltiness of the crust that they achieve by toasting the bread.  Then add some fruit, granola, yadda yadda... amazing.
::The chicken and waffles tasted solid, too.  Another fun fact about Denver - they seem to love chicken and waffles on menus.  Just thought it was weird because the last thing I would think about Denver is &#34;soulfood.&#34;

Bad   WTF: Ok so remember there were no mimosas?  Wrong.  The table next to us got mimosas right before we got our food.  So...about that... yeah.  There was no immediate apology.  Instead, we had to point out the mimosa miscount, and THEN there was a free round given to us by the manager.  But still, you should at least say something to us instead of trying to hide it like a kid that ate all the oreos in the house and put the little tray back in the wrapper.  Trust me, that is not the way to resolve it.  My mom never forgave me...

All in all, the place is solid and I probably would want to stop by for drinks at night the next time I&#39;m in Denver.  Just make sure they know what they got in the back."

This establishment intrigued me from the get-go.  I had a friend who lived in the Skye apartments a few years ago and there was never any parking.  So why put a restaurant here....why try to eat here??  

Lucky for me, I gave it a whirl.  Attempting parking mid game on a game day, actually worked out.  There is limited street parking but the restaurant has a few spots in the rear of the building. We got a spot after one lap.  

Inside we were surprised by how cool the decor was and how vast their liquor (whiskey) and beer menus were.  The decision of what to drink was intense, but fun. The menu is short and sweet. Fried chicken seemed to be the thing to have.   An it was great.   I did not care to get all the sweet stuff on it but that is just me not having a big sweet tooth.  The pork wings were delicious.  Sauce smother chunks of pork with a nice dipping sauce.  

Overall it was well worth it.  As we were leaving a gang of vintage bicyclists pulled up on a mini cruiser ride.  This just added to the fact that this place is a destination.

P.S.  They mentioned some pretty good pre Rockies game deals.

The first time was when they first opened and they didn&#39;t have bacon (it was breakfast) or ranch (I like to have a salad with brunch sometimes) and our food was super overpriced.

 The second time we went was on our big snow day and we were so excited to go to somewhere that was open and we could walk to. When we go there the staff was soo annoyed and made us feel unwelcome because they wanted to go home, we almost left. I get it, its crappy out (the one guy mentioned he hit something on the way to work) but if you&#39;re on the schedule and have to be there, you might as well make some money and try to make the best of it. There was maybe a total of 5 people total in the bar, by the time we left it was packed. We split the cheese curds and brussels sprouts, which are good, and a few beers. 

The third an final time was this evening. First off, they are so disorganized as a staff I&#39;m not sure how they even get through a day. We sat upstairs on the balcony because it was beautiful tonight. Its not too big, but big enough to enjoy some cocktails and sun. We sat at table that wasn&#39;t bussed because tables were limited. The waiter didn&#39;t take the old glasses and dirty napkins until he took or drink orders, came back to drop them off, and we had to ask him if he could please take the old cups and napkins away. Our waiter was very nice until we told him our chicken looked so weird and looked grey. It was not appetizing looking, so gross. I ordered the shrimp and grits and my shrimp was undercooked, we didn&#39;t say anything because we felt bad. My son said his burger was pretty good and I made sure to check it was cooked after we noticed ours, it was. Our waiter was pretty annoyed with us after we complained, and we could tell for the rest of our time there.

 I think their happy hour of buy one get one has to keep these guys going-its not the overpriced weird cooked food:(

BTW, they still don&#39;t have bacon."

Talked my boyfriend into coming as even though it&#39;s raining it&#39;s a Friday night and we needed to get out. We didn&#39;t arrive until after 10 but they serve food until 1am so no problem there! Right when we got in and were seated at a table my boyfriend decided this is his new favorite spot as we were seated in front of four big screen TVs, and my boyfriend loves sports more than he loves his own mother. Good for me, gives me time to leave a review. I thought this place was a rowdy bar that serves food, but it&#39;s the opposite. A restaurant where you can drink a little too much, but primarily a restaurant. And a freaking fantastic one. We started with the pork meatballs, which were served on top of chili. Need I say more? For entrees I got the Caesar salad and Papi got the burger. Papi is always on the hunt for the best burger. We are from California and nothing compares to In N Out for him, so he is ordering a burger at every restaurant until he finds the one. He says he&#39;s found it. I&#39;ve never seen him eat a whole burger and this lasted ten minutes. He has declared it easily the best burger in Denver, and with his expertise that opinion holds weight. Caesar was delicious. It had that something different that set it apart from your average Caesar. Maybe the garlic croutons or the dressing you could tell was made in house. We will be back again and again and again and again. Especially as all the sports allow me to browse E! News freely.

EDIT: Was two drinks deep when writing this so there were some serious typos that I will blame on autocorrect and not vodka. Opinion of this place holds true even when sober :)"

Love that they have such a variety of whiskeys. Our server was very nice, seemed knowledgeable and was able to give good recommendations based off what we already knew we liked.

Once a month, they do a pajama brunch, where if you wear your pajamas in, they give you 10% off your bill, and your choice of a free mimosa, beer or bloody mary. I was skeptical, but there were a ton of people in pajamas so I may try it next time. 

I started with the Habanero Bloody Mary. Not only was it fantastic, but it had a stick with some sort of meat, cheddar cheese, an olive, and a tiny pickle inside of it. Delicious! 

I ordered the french toast. I dont generally go for the sweet breakfast&#39;s, but it was fantastic and cooked to perfection. I liked the crunchiness of the outside, the fruit, and there wasnt too much maple syrup.

They told me 30 minutes and put my name on the list. I figured by the time we got there it would only be a short wait. We got there around 7 &amp; double checked to make sure our name was on the list. We were told it would still be 30 minutes so we got a drink at the bar. The first round it took about 5 minutes to order and another 3 to get our drinks, when I went up around 7:50 (still not seated!!) to get another round and cash out I waited 20 minutes to even talk to someone. They mis charged me on my drinks and by the time I was cashed out correctly we were just getting out table at 8:31!! After being quotes 30 minutes at 6:50 and a little after 7. 

The service improved once we sat down but it sure didn&#39;t make up for the first hour and a half waiting for a table. They did comp our $6 cheese curds for making us wait an hour and ten minutes OVER our quoted wait time. I guess I should have just stayed at the first place.

The good: the cheese curds were great but it&#39;s also hard the mess up fries cheese.They also gave my friend free ice cream because it was her birthday. I order the Tuna Bahn Mi and it was good but again not great. It was a little too spicy for me. Too many jalapeños. 

The bad: My friend was not impressed with her burger. She said it was bland and flavorless.. Nothing great. The fries reminded me of McDonalds fries, personally I&#39;m not a fan but some people love them. I enjoyed the whiskey mule but my second drink the flying melon was awful. It tasted like watered down alcohol. 

Overall I don&#39;t see myself coming back to this place."

The food menu was kind of limited, but what we had was good. I had the poke tacos - at least that&#39;s what I think they were. It was basically poke in a wonton shell, which was OK. In all honesty their brunch menu looks way more interesting than their dinner menu, and I will definitely be coming back in to try it! We also shared a whiskey flight, and of the three we tried the St. George single malt definitely stood out. After going home and looking this whiskey up it is apparently a limited release, so try it while you can. 

The seating is planned out very well given the cramped space, and although it was crowded we didn&#39;t feel bunched in. I hope they get their website up and running soon also."

And I&#39;m glad I did!

WTF (Whiskey Tango Foxtrot) has a fun layout, unique atmosphere and wonderful location for the many condos nearby. The mind-numbing number of whiskeys they have on hand and creative menu created by Justin Brunson of Masterpiece Deli and Old Major also add to the overall great experience that WTF adds to the neighborhood.

This place is my go-to down the street in a snowstorm or sunny day anytime/late night place to grab grub. Gotta be one of the best burgers in town.  There is a fun trivia night on Tuesdays and Saturday a good DJ. Great 2/4/1 Happy Hour!  Tons of great beers and whiskies. Nice open air front and second floor sun deck. Lots of TVs. Food was outstanding. Service was attentive but honestly inconsistent. Tonight was the best service I&#39;ve had ever. Just a little bit friendly goes a long way. We are locals and been hitting this place for months. Just found out the neighborhood gets 15% off. Score cuz the whiskeys are high prices and skimpy pours. But the quality is outstanding. Many labels you can&#39;t get everywhere else. I prefer the crushed ice as to the giant cube based on proportion size but you have to ask for it. Widow Jane is a personal favorite but they have several Pappy&#39;s on hand. Everything on the menu has been great. A little attention to service and this place will shine!

I could have really eaten anything at that point but after searching on Yelp I had to get the nachos and add guacamole. They came with bean and corn mix, chipotle sauce, cashew cheese, fresh jalapeños and salsa. All of this was vegan. Both the the cashew cheese and the chipotle sauce were more on the sweet side but I loved them. The salsa was slightly sweet as well but fresh. I ate the whole thing! Even though vegan I was incredibly satisfied and didn&#39;t miss the cheese or meat. 

I also got an oatmeal creme sandwich. This ginormous dessert was 2 cookies with a salty sweet cream in the middle. The oatmeal had a nice chew to them. I couldn&#39;t figure out what the middle was made of but it tasted like cream cheese. The sandwich was very sweet but I would get it again in a heartbeat. 

I really wish we had these out east (hint, hint, come to Florida!) and would definitely frequent them if I lived in Denver."

On most occasions, however, the food has been great and it&#39;s a great, quick option for vegan dining. 

My main pieces of feedback would be to (a) add more foods that are certified organic. The amount of probably nonorganic soy is disconcerting. Also (b) please add more soy-free options to the menu in general, and (c) maybe include some sugar free dessert options. Not super healthy to be consuming so much soy and can sugar, and it&#39;s false advertising to say otherwise."

They are happy to answer questions and make recommendations. Plenty of gluten-free options. 

Some carnivorous friends of mine came here on my recommendation and couldn&#39;t stop raving about the faux chicken and how close it tasted to the real thing. 

I&#39;ve had the kale macro bowl twice now, because I simply love the combination of the steamed kale with the sauerkraut, must be the German in me. Add to that brown rice, crispy sautéed tofu and a side of cucumber arame salad, and my body and soul feel nourished and happy. 

Desserts are worth saving room for. The peanut butter parfait was a little too liquid, more like a yogurt but still yummy. More peanut butter and some crunch, please! They had a key lime pie seasonal special during my last visit that was excellent. Creamy filling, not too sweet, nice citrus flavor and a crunchy oatmeal crust. Loved it, and I am not even a fan of key lime pie. Now, if they only added all-day breakfast, I&#39;d be here once per week."

This is actually really good&#34; (straight from the mouth of a meat-eater!). I dragged my husband and brother-in-law to this 100% fast-food vegan eatery for lunch, and they were pleasantly surprised at how much they liked the food. 

NATIVE CHICKEN RUN RANCH ($9.99): The menu described this chicken sandwich as the most popular item, so naturally I went with the tried and tested method. The &#34;chicken&#34; sandwich comes with lettuce, carrots, red onions, and vegan ranch. I went without onions, and loved the sandwich. My meal included a side of seasoned fries. Like a good soldier, I didn&#39;t leave a crumb behind! 5/5

NATIVE CHICKEN, BACON, &amp; AVOCADO CLUB ($10.29): A spicy version of the run ranch loaded with avocado. My husband really liked his club sandwich. Also includes a free side! 5/5

BIG &#39;OL BBQ BURGER ($10.29): Unfortunately, neither my brother-in-law or husband liked this burger. Luckily, we were able to request to get another chicken club at no charge. Once my brother-in-law had the Native chicken club in hand, we were perfect. 3/5

SERVICE: Super nice cashier and quick waiting times for food (less than 6 minutes).

They also give you a side of lemon garlic sauce and hummus. It was all very delicious. The portions were huge as well. I couldn&#39;t even finish all of my food.

Just went vegetarian last month after learning more about factory farming and wanting to do better as far as my health.

Ok, off the soapbox and onto the review of this place:

I love Native Foods Cafes.  I am able to enjoy the one in Boulder and at this location.  This location seems a lot better as far as setup and design.  I still can&#39;t get over how they make their &#34;burgers&#34; and &#34;wings&#34; taste like the real thing.  It blows my mind!  The food is always fresh and I encourage you to try a dessert.  My favorite desserts are the oatmeal cookie sandwich stuffed with &#34;cream cheese&#34; icing and the peanut butter parfait.  They are amazing and taste like luxurious, heavenly, scandalous deserts-only plant based!  Yeah!

Downside: front ordering area.  For some reason it always seems a bit slow.  Sometimes they open another register, but if they got that fixed, the experience would be great!  

Try this place even if you aren&#39;t vegetarian or vegan.  It is so good!"

During my first visit, I had the Korean BBQ sub. It was very rich in flavor, chock full of stuff, and the seitan had good texture. It was a bit on the salty side for me, and I craved a bit more sweetness. The ciabatta, though clearly fresh, was a bit too chewy for my taste. I was definitely nursing a sore jaw after that! The steamed kale was tasty and the perfect palate cleanser.

During my second trip, I had the Avocado Crunch Wrap and the Portobello and Sausage Burger to-go. The avocado wrap was exactly what I wanted. The avocado was warm and crunchy instantly quenching my aching desire for avocado fries. The slaw in the wrap was super fresh and helped to cut the richness. I got the dressings on the side, and both went well though I wasn&#39;t sure which was a which. 

I snuck a few bites of the burger which I planned to save for lunch. The flavors were all spot on. I loved the garlicky mushrooms with the seitan sausage. I do wish that there were more lettuce or something to go on it, as it would have helped add some crunch and keep the bun from getting as soggy. 

Overall, I&#39;ve had some good experiences and would definitely go back. It was fairly quick and well-priced vegetarian food with lots of creative options. Also, don&#39;t forget to get your rewards card and register it online as you get a BOGO entree or 50% off one."

As my first night in Denver and since my flight came in pretty late. This was our go to eatery for the night. Plenty of parking made it very convenient. 

It&#39;s also a great place to come with a group of people since you order and pay at the counter. 

We ended up ordering the buffalo wings, nachos, Moroccan bowl, carrot cupcake and peanut butter parfait (not shown). 

All of the dishes we ordered were great. No complaints here. I opted for steamed kale instead of quinoa on my bowl. It was excellent the second day. I guess the overnight marination made it even better. 

Nachos and buffalo wings have always been good. A definite must order. My honey ate those up! The only complaint I would have on the nachos is the Cheeze sauce was more towards the sweet rather than spicy. 

So if your vegan and visiting Denver, this is a must!!"

I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich with a tea and potato salad. The potato salad had an up charge of $2 which I noticed after I ordered. A little ridiculous because potatoes are not expensive. Plus I had to season it before I could eat it. 

The sandwich was very good and for being vegetarian it was a great knock off of chicken. The tea was decent but not wow inducing. Overall I thought the meal was good but quite overpriced."

Found Native Foods Café on yelp and it looked like a great option.

I really like the fast-casual concept and the fact that I can order take-out if the mood strikes me.  You can order at the counter or online, then they hand you a cup and a number, you fill up your drink at the juice bar, then take a seat and they bring the food out.  I ordered water, but since it was my first visit they offered me a little sample cup to try the juices and teas - what a nice touch!  The girls behind the counter were super friendly and helpful.  I tried the watermelon fresca (yum!) and the strawberry lavender lemonade (also very good, but probably too much sugar for my diet).  

I ordered the Thai &#34;Meatballs&#34; which are made with seitan tossed in a sweet thai chili sauce.  It comes with Super Slaw (cabbage, kale, chia seeds), lemongrass broccoli (to die for, ate all of that up first), and quinoa.  The bowl was huge.  Even though I had skipped breakfast and was absolutely starving, I only ate about half.  And every single thing in that bowl was delicious.

I will be back.  In fact, the biggest challenge will be not blowing all my money here."

I saw the cashew cheese on the menu, and it appealed to my whole food, low meat diet. Not. At. All. Ask them about food allergies, and you&#39;ll find out there are hidden ingredients. They still didn&#39;t give me an actual ingredient list. Everything on the menu has soy. 

Their menu only mentioned that they sub tofu for all the meats on the back. It&#39;s pretty misleading. I eat vegetarian meals for health and variety, and this restaurant was not good for that. If you&#39;re a strict vegan, this might be a good place to splurge if you&#39;re really craving a &#34;burger.&#34; It just annoyed me though."

 This location usually has knowledgeable and personable employees, today we stumbled upon a new crew that seemed a little less experienced but they did their best... we miss our star wars guy that went to Africa

 One thing I thought could be improved on is the parking in front.... there are 3 spots reserved for to go orders only. 3 spots! That&#39;s bananas for Denver... especially seeing as there about...meh, 9 spots in total. This shopping location has so many other restaurants around, I feel like forfeiting those spots allows for other people to choose another options to dine at simply because they have parking available for them.

Denver, the land of high desert cowboys and the donkeys has how many Native Foods? I counted four of them all in Denver proper while bookmarking every Vegan place in town. In fact, I believe there&#39;s more Native Foods in Denver than there are of all the Vegan places combined!

Native Foods is set up nearly exactly like Veggie Grill as far as their ordering process and general concept. It shouldn&#39;t come as no surprise since they were created by the same folks. Now with a fresh influx of millions of dollars, they are both rapidly expanding.

I&#39;m a nacho fiend and Native makes some of the best in the business. Huge piles of cashew cream, corn salsa, tons of cilantro, guacamole and a smooth cheesy sauce. This is one of my favorite nachos around. The price is spot on too. Their cheese sauce is a bit sweet so it could use a few tweaks to make it perfect.

I could pretty much live off their starter menu alone. I also had to get Buffalo Wings even though I knew I would be stuffed. They have a nice crunch to them but the sauce isn&#39;t as great as Veggie Grill. Then again VG makes the best in the industry so it&#39;s not a fair comparison. These were still pretty good and I doubt you&#39;ll find better anywhere else. 

My honey loves their Native Bowls She got the Morroccan Bowl which just so happened to be gluten free for all you weirdos out there. It was pretty damn good. Maybe even better than VG! 

They have a much better selection of desserts than VG has. Several cupcakes and parfaits are available.

All we wanna know is when the hell is NF coming to the Bay Area to give Veggie Grill a run for their money?

As others have said, the wings and oatmeal pies are must-haves.

Also, I hope they never ever ever ever do away with their Wellingtons.  Those magical puff pastries have become a Thanksgiving tradition for me and my family.

Eating animals sure tastes good. Few things can beat a ribeye grilled medium rare or a really good burger, huh?

But we know it&#39;s more healthy and ethical to eat more vegetables and cause less animal suffering and pain than when we choose to eat meat. 

Now don&#39;t get me wrong. I hunt and fish. And hey, did I forget to mention that I&#39;m a hypocrite sometimes? But really, come on. The practice of eating factory-farmed meat and fish is pretty disgusting. We should all just honestly confess to the truth of that. 

You can say it&#39;s &#34;natural&#34; and we were anatomically born programmed to eat meat, and that may be true. It doesn&#39;t, however, make the conditions under which we get our meat any less troubling. And hey, I&#39;ve been to what&#39;s marketed as a &#34;cage free and free range&#34; chicken farm. Lemme tell you that&#39;s not a very pretty sight. Looking out over 25,000 chickens jammed inside a warehouse that was where they are fed and given water (and therefore &#34;choose&#34; not to venture out into the sun-baked barren yard--which they call the &#34;range&#34;--available to them) was a sobering sight.

But also let&#39;s admit that a lot of vegetarian food just doesn&#39;t taste that great. It isn&#39;t that satisfying and frequently not that filling either. That&#39;s probably because our bodies just love the taste of fat (and salt and sugar . . . ummmmm). 

So what&#39;s this got to do with the Native Foods Café that on it&#39;s storefront calls itself &#34;The world&#39;s greatest vegetarian restaurant?&#34; Well, NFC has been teaching me that I can have that full and satisfying taste of fat and salt and sweetness without having to eat meat every day. Over the last short while I&#39;ve become addicted to their Portobello sausage burger, their Rueben and their &#34;Native Chicken&#34; twisters (all vegetarian). God are they good. Haven&#39;t tried their desserts yet because after having one of their sandwiches and a side I&#39;m too full to consider dessert. But next time I&#39;m gonna skip the side and save room for one of their great looking cupcakes.

So Native Foods I love that you&#39;re making my change to a more plant-based diet a pleasure instead of a pain. Thanks and see ya again soon.

Although I am an omnivore, I do love experimenting with vegetarian and vegan foods whenever I get a good chance (i.e., when it&#39;s not, say, a mixed green salad with a couple of carrot matchsticks and a single, sad cherry tomato on top). Some of my favorite Native Foods dishes include the Bangkok Curry Bowl, the Portobello and Sausage Burger and the Buffalo &#34;Chicken&#34; Wings.

For those of us who have no eff-ing clue what that means, it means no meat even though they plainly use &#34;chicken&#34; and &#34;bacon&#34; in their menu.

The food is going to be expensive. VERY EXPENSIVE. We spent $60 for three people and were barely full after the experience. The food tastes OK, just don&#39;t expect anything like the real thing. I&#39;m not a vegan or vegetarian, so I don&#39;t know how it matches up with other types of food. Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s no Watercourse.

That is the big drawback on this place. It&#39;s pretending to be something it&#39;s not. And it&#39;s doing it at a price that you&#39;d expect at a place with more of an atmosphere than what you can get at McDonalds.

We finally found an excuse to drive to Glendale over the weekend and decided to stop in.  What a delicious find!

The staff was accommodating and patient with this veggie newbie, explaining the difference between tempeh and seitan like it was no big thang!  Daughter opted for the Greek Gyro dish, and I chose the Bangkok Curry on the cashier&#39;s  recommendation.  We loved both!   The veggies were steamed just as I like them, still crispy and sweet.  I loved the sweet/spicy combination of the curry sauce, and the seared tofu was delicious.  Daughter thought the fresh lemon added a nice bite to the gyro, and the seitan was sliced thin just as lamb would be.  Her dish had quinoa instead of brown rice, which was a nice touch.

I love that there&#39;s no soda here, believe it or not.  Beverage choices include a delicious lavender lemonade (which I am now addicted to), a watermelon agua fresca (daughter loved it, me not so much), and several iced teas.  Drinks are self serve drink all you want, and they&#39;ll even give you a to-go cup if you want.

Prices were on par for what you would pay at Panera or other fast casual shops in the area.  Plus, sign up for their rewards program - you&#39;ll get a free drink at sign up, free dessert for completing a survey and a $10 credit as a birthday gift!  

I definitely think Native Foods is a restaurant worth visiting at least once.  I loved it, daughter loved it.

My only regret is that there&#39;s not one on the north end of town (hey, Native Foods owners...looks like there are a few spots open still at the Webster Lake Promenade going in in Northglenn! *nudgenudge*)"

Walking in, one would be hard pressed to think this is a vegan restaurant. The decor is bright and modern and aside from some cheery &#34;earth&#34; stuff on the walls there is no pachouli or dreadlocks here. Not that I wear pachouli or dreadlocks, but hopefully you get the point. Anyway... the format is that you order at the counter and they&#39;ll bring stuff to your table. There&#39;s a glass case with a bunch of amazing looking deserts, lest you be trying to get out of there without one.

The menu is varied with everything from buffalo &#34;chicken&#34; strips, burgers and &#34;meatball&#34; sandwiches to tofu and kale bowls. Honestly, you have to try all of them, so bring a larger belt. Everything is amazingly tasty and fresh. Though the meals are all under $10 (from my memory) look to spend about $15 between appetizers, meals and deserts. You won&#39;t be sorry.

I&#39;ve now been to locations in both Denver, CO and outside Portland, OR and really wish they&#39;d open in Albuquerque!"

So being hungry and without many veggie options we headed across the parking lot to check this place out. 

And we&#39;re glad we did. Thankfully everything isn&#39;t deep fried like the offerings in most vegan joints.  There were deep fried things though, a chicken ranch burger that sounded really good, but we had eaten at Watercourse the night before and were all greased out. 

So for our non deep fried experience we tried the Reuben, meatball sub, and scorpion burger. The sandwiches were all very good, we tried each other&#39;s and in the end two liked the scorpion burger best and one voted for the Reuben. For sides we tried the potato salad, broccoli, and dipped into a little grease (ha) with French fries.  The French fries had a nice spicy powder on it which gave it a little kick. The other two sides were cold and tasty.

We enjoyed our meal here.  There&#39;s nothing we&#39;re screaming in ecstasy over but hey, good solid vegan food is nothing to sniff at. This is our new go-to place in Denver."

I got a Bangkok curry bowl, which was severely lacking in flavor.  There was a little bit of curry flavor in the rice, but it was completely lacking from the rest of the dish, so I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the unseasoned steamed vegetables.  My girlfriend had a soul bowl, which was quite a bit more flavorful. The cornbread wasn&#39;t very good, however.  The sweet potato fries were a winner. They were covered in too much of whatever salt/spice that was, but regardless they were delicious.

The portion sizes are pretty good, and the restaurant had a nice, clean atmosphere."

For example, my beloved Mad Cowboy bowl is gone :-( I settled for the Rockin&#39; Moroccan Bowl since I like Quinoa, but compare to my absolutely favorite Quinoa &#34;Fried Rice&#34; dish at PF Chang&#39;s, Native Foods&#39; version is a little too &#34;wet&#34;. If they could toast the quinoa, it&#39;ll be much better. I also should&#39;ve asked them to take out the currants - can&#39;t stand dried fruit in my food... The yam pieces didn&#39;t help either... Perhaps I should stay away from ethnic style dishes if I don&#39;t want to to taste like half-desserts?!

BF&#39;s Italian Meatball Sub looked fantastic! I got to taste some (he thought it was too messy to &#34;handhold&#34; it so he deconstructed the sandwich and gave me pieces of the bread and meatball to try. Note to self: always, always get fries as a side. The steamed kale was so so bland. I couldn&#39;t help but be reminded of the sauteed kale at City &#39;O City, how much better it was (ironically that was the only thing I liked at City &#39;O City... I digress)

For dessert, we opted for the Sticky Toffee Date Cake. Native Foods&#39; desserts always have the ability to surprise. You won&#39;t expect the dry-looking toffee cake to taste any good but it turned out delicious, not overly sweet, very fragrant. At first, I was like, where is the &#34;stickiness&#34; of it? Then I realized I&#39;d forgotten the toffee sauce on the side in a little container. When I slathered the sauce on the cake, it felt like gravy (I know, kind of gross with chunks that looked like grease, definitely not very spreadable), but my impression was once again, wrong. Hey, I&#39;m actually glad to be proven wrong!

I will always enjoy the casual, bright dining room, even the high tables! The openess and natural light from plenty windows make for great food pictures. Service was excellent as usual."

We were impressed with the large variety of options.  It is so very refreshing to have all of the options available to me rather than one token vegetarian option on a restaurant menu.  

We had the Thai soup, potato salad, Bangkok curry bowl, meatball sub, fries, lavender lemonade, and watermelon juice. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is inviting.  We were there around 11:30-ish on a Saturday.  There were quite a few other people there, but it was not crowded yet.  Although by the time we left, they were getting quite full, there was still ample room to move around so you didn&#39;t feel packed in or that you were going to bump into something or someone.

I was not wild about the Thai soup, it was on the bitter side, but to be fair I was comparing it to the flavor in a Tom Khaa soup which has a slightly sweet but very tangy flavor.  If I hadn&#39;t been expecting a Tom Khaa flavor, I would have thought their Thai soup was just great.  The yummy potato salad was light with the herby-lemon dressing.  The Bangkok curry bowl was just delicious.  The sauce was the right amount so as to flavor the bowl without making the dish soupy.  The tender kale was a pleasant addition to the bowl.  My meat-eating husband enjoyed the meatball sub and fries.  We are all looking forward to coming back to try more of their menu items."

I opted for the Oklahoma Bacon Cheeseburger (fake bacon, fake cheese, fake meat; all plant-based). Along with some fries and some delicious blueberry hibiscus tea (which I mixed with a bit of the lavender strawberry lemonade). We stopped for a late lunch so there was no rush. Service was great."

I first heard of Native Foods on Facebook as a suggested page to examine. I found out that this chain is out of California. Interesting enough Native Foods is not in Washington and Seattle where there is a large group of people entirely devoted to being vegetarian and vegan. So I am surprised it has not spread up north along the West Coast.
Anyway I had a very good meal here with a friend! I got the Taco Salad here which was delicious! My freshness criteria was met as all the veggies and other ingredients were top notch in freshness! The food was great!
They have a large selection of different drinks along with brands we know. For example they had Lavender Lemonade which was great! Later I went back for a Hibiscus drink which also was great!

So far, I&#39;ve tried the Sesame Kale Bowl (SOOO GOOD), Chicken Run Ranch Burger (mmm), and the Soul Bowl (please sir, can I have some more?). I&#39;m pretty sure every single menu item is finger lickin&#39; good. You can read their online menu for the descriptions, but I will say that unless you have an intestinal parasite, you should be more than satisfied with the portions.  I also enjoyed my lavender lemonade (with free refills!). Also, I sort of thought that as a very casual restaurant, they would not have lots of garnish. If you don&#39;t like green onions, parsley/cilantro, etc, you should say so when you order. 

More specifically for this location:
1) parking sucks. Big shared lot with a hotel and many other chains. 
2) Great service. As i dined, I watched a server wipe down the table, the chairs, the legs of the chairs, the slats of the chairs, etc. After we finished, the manager bussed our table and asked if we wanted &#34;to go&#34; cups to take our beverages with us. 
3) Lots of seating. I&#39;d be more concerned about finding a parking space than I would be an available table."

A co-worker turned me onto this and I honestly did not think I would like it. I am not a vegetarian or vegan but I like to eat healthy, I often  find the vegan and the protein places turn me off for lack of flavor. But not this place. I have tried a few things on the menu now and really like it.  I swear you cannot tell they serve no meat. Native Foods cooks up tofu and tempeh in ways that mimic the flavor and texture of meat. Its really amazing. I can honestly say I actually feel better after eating here. And I hadn&#39;t taken much notice as to how food makes me feel until recently. I feel energized and alert.  

The twister wrap is very tasty with blackened &#34;chicken&#34; and the fish tacos are delicious.  You can order online and pick it up which is  pretty quick to not have to stand in the long line."

I ordered the nachos, which were pretty good. The taco &#39;meat&#39; was all right, and the &#39;cheese&#39; tasted kinda like hummus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I would&#39;ve enjoyed the nachos more without either of those ingredients added. Plus, the nachos suffered the same curse as nachos around the world: the first half or so of the plate is delicious, and the last bit are all soggy. I think that this dish would be better served as more like a seven layer dip with the chips on the side. 

Despite that, they do a really good job of making vegan food something that carnivores can enjoy. The staff is friendly, and the manager makes it a point to come by and ask how everything is. Remember when that used to be the norm? I don&#39;t, so I think it&#39;s really cool that they do it here. 

If you&#39;re vegetarian/vegan, or just curious about the food, give Native Foods a try."

Neither of us really knew much about it at the time.  

OK, while I haven&#39;t been a vegetarian in many years (constant problems with anemia and hormonal imbalances during that time), I still eat many meatless meals and have many meatless days.  My friend.... well... let&#39;s just say I regularly play Sneak the Vegetable Into His Meal as he has about the least healthy diet of any adult I&#39;ve ever known.  I ended up ordering their Native Nachos as I had been hungry for something Southwestern -- like what I had regularly in New Mexico.  My friend ordered their Soul Bowl, which I&#39;ve heard is unfortunately going off their menu.  

My nachos were solidly good, though far from great, but I really liked my friend&#39;s Soul Bowl.  Even he found himself liking it, eating vegetables I doubt he&#39;s eaten in years.  The setbacks are that the food really does charge a premium for trying to eat healthy(er) and the drinks were... interesting.  The service was friendly, which is a huge plus.

I try to eat healthy and they definitely did it right.  I had the portabello/sausage(setian) burger which had grilled portobellos, Sausage Seitan, caramelized onions, pomodoro, sweet roasted garlic, creamy pumpkin seed pesto and mayo.   received a free beverage for joining the rewards program.  I had the organic blueberry iced tea which was awesome with blueberry flavor. It was very tasty with the right spice and flavor but it was the price that had me provide a lower rating.

I was disappointed to see the menu that the high price of a sandwich ($9.95) did not include a side, which to add fries (which I got sweet potato) was an additional $1.95.  Overall I spent $13 for a okay sized sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries.   I think if the sandwhich was overall $2 less (which $9.95 pricing seemed to be pretty standard here), I might have been more satisfied.

I love that Denver is getting these healthfood restaurants in the area, but I wish they would not take advantage of the consumers that to purchase healthy food.  I don&#39;t frequent the usual fast food locations neither am I vegan/veggie (I just like good food and try to stay healthy).  With this pricing I may just keep me away like the bad for you fast food restaurants.  Okay it was good so maybe that last statement is a little harsh....If I was going out with a friend for lunch/dinner I would still recommend, however it will never be the convenient stop to purchase a meal for myself unless I am right there for WOB."

As soon as we approached the counter, my friend and I were kindly greeted by Shane, who I think was the manager.  He asked if I had dined here before and I said no, although my friend had.  He offered us free samples of watermelon fresco, which was so fresh (and homemade!).  He was so thoughtful and was extremely knowledgable about the dishes and how they were made.  He then offered me a free beverage because it was my first time!  T

We ordered the macro bowls, which were huge, and tasty.  Marshall was another staff member who brought us our plates after we sat down.  He was very attentive, asking us if we needed anything else.

On the one hand, I am not really the target market, and some of this food was not really my cup of tea.  On the other hand, they offer a diverse menu, artfully prepared, and the concept is well developed.  This could just as easily be a 3-star review, but I think the 4 is justified. I came here with a couple friends, and I am glad that I have been here.  

I went with the Nuevo Native Nachos (Homemade corn tortilla chips covered in black beans, Native Taco Meat, Native Chipotle Crema, Native Cheese, salsa fresca, and guacamole. Topped with corn, green onions, cilantro and jalapenos), a cup of the tortilla soup, and an Oatmeal Creme Pie (Whipped vanilla creme sandwiched between two soft baked oatmeal cookies) for dessert.  I thought the nachos were okay.  The chips were not as crisp as I prefer.  The toppings were decent.  The native cheese was like a garlicky hummus.  The guacamole was good.  The seitan-based &#34;taco meat&#34; was only fair, in my opinion.  I also think it was this substance that troubled my tummy later on in the day.  The tortilla soup was okay.  It was well made, but the flavors did not really pop for me. The oatmeal creme pie was delicious.  It was large and tasty, and I saved half of it for later.  I froze it when I got home, and I liked it even better that way.

Mixed thoughts here but my impressions track along the lines of Doug H.&#39;s - it&#39;s a more than decent venture into the &#34;vegan&#34; market but I think, at least for me, they are kind of fundamentally ambivalent about their mission.  

On one hand it must be a real breath of fresh air to committed vegans.  How many places can they explore the entire menu without fear?  On the other hand the extensive use of &#34;faux&#34; proteins (tempeh, seitan, tofu, etc.) to stand-in for animal based proteins in &#34;traditional&#34; menu items serves only to accentuate how irreplaceable animal proteins are to the &#34;real&#34; thing in many preparations.  I find their insistence on using meat based menu names (meatballs, sausage, burgers, wings, etc.) somehow slightly derivative.  Like, &#34;don&#39;t tell &#39;em and they won&#39;t miss the meat&#34;.

Ended up here thanks to the overwhelming number of people jamming Jax to the rafters and I am nothing if not open minded when it comes to food.  I&#39;ll pretty much try anything at least once and the friend I was with makes a valiant effort to eschew animal proteins although not always successfully.  Place is cute and the staff very warm and welcoming.   Parking is a problem at CitySet but we&#39;d already faced that with our Jax attempt.

So, we sampled a number of menu items as we often do at a new restaurant to get an idea of what&#39;s up.  Spent way too much money and left too much behind - our fault - not theirs.  Here&#39;s my takeaway in a nutshell.  They are making a sincere effort with lots of successes with dishes that are naturally vegan (great salads) and some not so successful adventures into protein replacements.  There are no such things as vegan sausage or wings, for example, and there never will be.  I&#39;d go back and stick to what they do best.  I can only imagine what a revelation this place must be to those who&#39;ve been held &#34;hostage&#34; by the hipster ridden City &#39;O City and Watercourse though."

I love a restaurant that makes eating vegan easy and delicious for everyone.  Vegan food doesn&#39;t have to be confusing or nerve racking for anyone when it is served up so beautifully and non-pretentious as they do as Native.  

Here are the reviews of the dishes I have enjoyed at Native!

Native Chicken Wings - The buffalo sauce and ranch dip are spot on!  Unfortunately the wings themselves are not up my alley.  They are good just not the best I have had.  The batter they used reminds me of what I remember a fast food chicken nugget tasted like.  Sauce is perfect - wing was a little weird.

Sesame Kale Macro Bowl - AMAZING!  This was such a clean dish!  Grilled tempeh, steamed kale, rice, and an amazing ginger dressing.  When you want something filling but still very healthy this is the route to take.  It is amazing how great just a couple ingredients can taste when paired correctly!

Posole Rojo - This is their Monday soup of the day and it is fantastic.  It has seitan, hominy, onions, and a great posole broth!  This was a great light soup, the flavors are very complex and it was absolutely delicious!

Classic Deli Reuben - Just stop it - this is so good.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a &#39;real&#39; rueben but I am sure this sandwich would be in the running for best.  The  saurkraut is out of this world, home made and perfect.

Oatmeal Creme Pie - Get it - Thank me later! I have no words!"

I was originally introduced to the place while roaming around Wicker Park in Chicago Illinois and tried the Native Nachos- THEY.WERE.DELISH. 

Coming home, I knew I had to take the time to try one in the Denver Metro area. This time around I ordered the Mexican Cobb. It was alright. Prefer the nachos over the Mexican Cobb which is a salad. Something in it gave me a headache for the rest of the day. Which makes me wonder if whats substituted out is replaced with subtle sodium because the variety packed salad didn&#39;t taste salty, but for the most part- only sodium gives me headaches. 

Nonetheless, I also tried there carrot cake cupcake. DELISH. 

I&#39;ll be back again, to try something besides the Cobb! :)"

Sooner happened to be last Saturday night. 

We arrived at 6pm and it was busy, there were only two tables left, so we grabbed a menu and a table to figure out our order. I then proceeded to get in line since this was my treat.

We ordered the wings as a starter to share,  B. had the Oklahoma Bacon Cheeseburger with a side of fries and I ordered the Portobello and Sausage Burger sans Mayo (Veganaise). Since my sandwich was the day&#39;s special, I got a complimentary side. I selected the sweet potato fries. We both had the Lavender Lemonade to drink. 

Our food took a while as it was busy, but the manager came up to us and explained things were running a bit slowly and offered to buy us dessert so we ordered a Peanut Butter Parfait and Double Delight Brownie to take home for later. Very nice touch.

Our food was worth the wait!  Both sandwiches were flavorful and filling and the wings were like little fried chicken bites. One of the things B. misses most about being an omnivore is his occasional fried chicken, I swear I saw a tear trickle down his cheek while we ate. Okay maybe not.  We shared the desserts later that evening and both were scrumptious!

I will point out that while we thoroughly enjoyed our meals, they do have a few kinks to work out: mainly staffing during busy times. Clearly, they were understaffed last Saturday. By the time we ordered and were waiting for our food, the line was out the door. And it wasn&#39;t moving quickly. I think a big part of this was the cashiers were explaining the story behind Native Foods to everyone who came up to order. I think this is important since they are new to the area. 

However, I think it would have been more efficient to have someone explain it to the customers waiting in line, perhaps the servers offering the free samples. Additionally,  while we knew our food would be a be a bit late, our wings came out after our meals and our fries were lukewarm.  Neither issue is enough to keep us from returning though.

We are definitely fans of this chain and will definitely return again and again. We just may wait a while for it to die down a bit."

I would have thought that there was a little more imagination at work here--salads sprinkled with Seitan, Tempeh meatball subs don&#39;t rock my  world.  I had the kale salad with said Seitan on top, sweet potato fries and a carrot cake cupcake.  Pretty good for having no meat or dairy.  But that&#39;s just it:  you always add that condition, &#34;having no meat or dairy&#34; because Native Foods is not good enough to make you forget the missing meat and dairy.   Don&#39;t get me wrong, Native Foods is good at what they do, but it&#39;s pretty much what you would expect Panera would do if they had to do without meat or dairy.

The service was nice and friendly; they are pretty patient while you try to sort out what&#39;s what.  As another reviewer mentioned, it would seem both more efficient and more eco-friendly if they had the menu printed on the board rather than paper menus hidden from view.  

Finally, Native Foods is on the expensive side.  My meal cost about $15, which for fast-casual is high.  I would like to see a Vegan restaurant prove out the case that not only is eating vegan more healthy but that it has more value for diners.  If your business is based on the supposition that diners will pay more to eat healthy, I&#39;ll show you a business that is doomed for failure."

The steak, chicken and veggies are perfectly cooked and seasoned well, this is my go to favorite!

Mexican food - it&#39;s so hard to screw up, right?  Just throw more cheese on it!

We got a free appetizer with a coupon from a local hotel.  We got the Small Nachos. Well, the app name is correct - it was a very small order.  Not very loaded and not very tasty.

I wanted a drink so I asked the waitress what she recommenced.  She told me the Lg Cabo Rita was great.  I told her I didn&#39;t mind the $10.99 price tag as long as it was a good drink and wouldn&#39;t give me a headache the next day from cheap booze.  Well, I didn&#39;t get a headache - but that was becasue there was hardly any booze in the drink at all.  And once again, tasteless,  I left 1/4 of the drink.

I again asked the waitress&#39;s advice about the Shrimp Quesadilla.  I asked if they were tiny shrimp.  She said No.  I asked to have them blackened.  She said OK.  Well her idea of small and my idea of small are not the same.  The shrimp were small and limp - not blackened, more like steamed. And there was nothing even close to the description of oozing cheese.  Again tasteless.  

So why would I give it another chance?  This place is right across the street from a hotel I stay at for work so it is very convenient.  There are a lot of other dining options nearby but a lot of my coworkers want the quick inexpensive option of Mexican,  So, next time I&#39;ll just order beer and a few simple tacos.
That&#39;s gotta be better, right?"

I had the vegetarian cheese enchiladas. They put in veggies in the cheese enchiladas for me so that was really nice. It came with some pico de gayo sauce, rice and beans. They have huge portions and I could not finish my entree. They also have free refills for their chips and salsa!!

I went on a Sunday, when the entire day was a happy hour. Their chips &amp; salsa were good (chips served warm -- always a good thing!).  The &#34;small&#34; margarita was very large, and it was at the bargain happy hour price of only four dollars!  The Aztec chicken fajita salad left something to be desired, Of the three items, it was the least appealing. The chicken seemed like &#34;chicken fingers,&#34; and the veggies were very limited in both quantity and quality, and the lettuce was iceberg.  And I&#39;m not talking Titanic.

So all in all, I&#39;d recommend it if your options are few, but keep expectations in line with what it is. This is not a gourmet or authentic Mexican cuisine restaurant.  Good, not great, but well worth the money spent.  What I saved went to the bartender&#39;s tip.  Be generous.  Be nice.  Always tip your bartender well."

Natural, fresh food at reasonable prices, a wide selection of Margaritas from $5 to $17. My wife and I sat at the outdoor patio, which was nice on a warm summer evening. However, the restaurant is located on a busy, noisy street. We sat away from the street, on the parking lot side, which was also noisy. Our whole experience might have been better inside, even if we had to talk over the games on the multiple TVs.

Read the menu closely when you order a margarita. They have two prices and two different sizes of glasses. When I didn&#39;t notice and didn&#39;t specify a size, my waitress automatically brought me the bigger, more expensive one, without asking.

My vegetarian burrito was excellent, and my wife&#39;s fish tacos were good, even though the fish was battered and deep-fried, which I found odd for a place that brags about healthy menu alternatives.

Sloppy drunks falling out of their bar stools, stealing fruit from behind the bar when the bartenders turned their backs, and being loud, rude and obnoxious.

The mango habanero wings and chips and salsa (spicy, chunky, delicious) are a great start. You can&#39;t go wrong with the chimichanga, fajitas, carne asada, or fish tacos. Even the fish sandwich isn&#39;t bad (considering you&#39;re in Colorado) if you&#39;re not feeling Mexican food. The draft and bottled beer offers a decent selection with some local options such as 90 shilling. The bartenders are great too. This is a great place to go if you&#39;re staying at a hotel on 40th. The only drawbacks are that the beers have been downsized and prices across the board are up 10-15% in the last year. Management is also hesitant to put hockey on TV so, if that&#39;s what ours trying to watch, make sure you can have it put on before you get too committed. The bartenders are great. The owner himself stated that a successful restaurant requires, &#34;having affordable beer and food, lots of TVs, and hiring mostly women.&#34; If that doesn&#39;t offend you, you should give this place a try."

Not going to lie I was expecting it to have a lot of stereotypical Mexican flare to the decor. I was surprised when I arrived. The lean more towards the urban than the Mexican. The place has a more sports bar kind of feel with a semi Mexican designed menu. I don&#39;t believe I even noticed anything mexican at all about the decor. 

They have different sports playing on their many TVs and have an impressive bar in the center of it all. 

We ordered mainly appetizers just so we could munch, hang out, and chit chat. We ordered the buffalo wings, nachos, crane asada fries, and the quesadilla. The buffalo wings were pretty standard and nothing special. The nachos weren&#39;t very impressive so wouldn&#39;t order those in the future. The quesadilla was pretty good but it&#39;s hard to mess up a quesadilla haha. The crane asada fries were awesome though! A definite must! I think the fries had more cheese on them than the nachos.   

Although we didn&#39;t order any of the alcoholic beverages I did sneak a peek at the menu real quick. From what I saw their everyday prices are pretty good. Would be a good place to kick back a couple beers or cocktails with friends. Like most &#34;mexican&#34; places nowadays they also have the beer-rita for your dining pleasure."

I ordered the sampler appetizer.  It was a great value and a lot of food for the price.  It was not bad tasting especially the chili relleno and the Habanero wings.  Problems were my food was cold but I was hungry and did not mind too much.  I ordered blue cheese sauce and got ranch.  Once again, hot tired and hungry so no biggie. 3 stars because no chips were served all night.  One of my colleagues had to ask for chips because ordered Guacamole.

It was like it had been pureed or something! I tried another bite with a generous amount of sour cream and avocado this time, in hopes to disguise it, but nope. I&#39;m not a picky eater. I&#39;m not a complainer. I am easy to please and hate to send anything back. (Unless there&#39;s half a bug in my salad!) But I couldn&#39;t keep eating whatever that meat was.

We came in for lunch with a party of five people. We were able to choose where we wanted to sit, which was very nice, since one of our party would have had a hard time sitting at most of the bar-height tables with tall chairs.

The complementary chips and salsa were not very good - even for store-bought. Just lacking in freshness and flavor. The chips were bland and obviously came out of a bag; the salsa was just &#34;spicy&#34; and didn&#39;t taste like much of anything else. We ate them anyway, though, because we were starving.

Our server was very nice. She was charming, attentive, and did a perfect job the whole time we were there. There were definitely flies, as another reviewer previously mentioned. I was disappointed that the staff didn&#39;t offer to help us get rid of them when they saw us waving our hands about.

Once our entrees came out, my opinion about the food changed drastically: it was very good! I ordered the blackened tilapia, which, in contrast with the chips and salsa, was very fresh and super flavorful. I really enjoyed the sides of rice and black beans. Usually these are just throw-away filler, but these sides were extremely enjoyable and enhanced the fish. 

We all shared an order of sopapias for dessert, which were SO GOOD. The portion size was just right, too, for sharing between five adults. I highly recommend them!"

It&#39;s all about perspective. Don&#39;t forget Chris &#34;Birdman&#34; Anderson has a NBA championship ring, so take this review as you will. I&#39;ve lived in GVR for over eight years now and this is the only place that 1: has survived and 2: I keep coming back to and it&#39;s for good reason. I&#39;d be foolish to sit here and say that every single visit I&#39;ve had here has been perfect, some far from it, but the best part about Urban Sombrero is just that. Yes it can get loud, yes it can get slow when it&#39;s busy and yes the service can, at times,  be spotty but like I said in my last review, the owners are sitting in the corner... EVERY night. Rob and James are the gentleman that run this joint and if there is a problem they are the first ones there to fix it but the thing is, if you don&#39;t speak up and say anything I have zero sympathy for you. At that point, it&#39;s your fault! The California Chicken Club is spot on, the carnitas are &#34;tell your friends good&#34; and the patio is the best one you&#39;ll find east of I-225. A full bar, great food, cheep prices, any game you want on TV and the friendliness of your local dive back home is what makes this not only my bar... But the best bar around.

Their chips and salsa taste like they are straight out of a bag - the chips are warm, which is awesome, but I&#39;m 80% sure their salsa is just some Pace jars. Not bad, but eh.

Mushroom fajitas were awesome. Really good. Wish they gave you more than 3 tortillas with them, but that&#39;s not really a big deal to get resolved.

Services was okay. The girls working were friendly enough, but clearly just kind of &#39;meh&#39; about being there. Didn&#39;t try the margaritas, so I can&#39;t attest to those, but they looked good! Hubs said his burger was one of the best he&#39;d had, and my dad loved the fish tacos! 

I think another try is due here soon!"

As a diabetic I am left with having to walk out with my family of 6. Here are some suggestions on how you should of handled this. 1)Get your act together when it comes to ordering. You are also always out of milk (for your kids menu.) 2) Go to Sam&#39;s or Cosco and buy a box of Diet Pepsi mix for your machine. 3) Go to any store and buy some 24 packs of Diet Coke and fill your customers glasses with ice and that. &#34;We&#39;re out of Diet Pepsi&#34; REALLY?!?! Also your waitresses need to leave their attitudes at the door when coming to work. You make your tips off of being friendly with your customers not your good looks.

I asked for an order of guacamole and it was there quickly.  My food arrived within minutes of my ordering it -- hot and nicely prepared.  Food was excellent, not quite five stars, but excellent.

The fried ice cream was amazing! With just a very tiny crunchy and very sugar-y coating, it arrived steaming hot with a perfect ball of creamy vanilla ice cream inside. My friends were very happy with their drinks, they ordered a Skinny Girl Margarita pitcher was a strong and so generous that they couldn&#39;t finish it all. 

The chips and salsa were ok and the guacamole was fine. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were kind of weird, just a tangy flavor I wasn&#39;t so familiar with, definitely prefer Los Angeles&#39; tacos, far more authentic - there were definitely Americanized

There was lively atmosphere and our waitress was super hot. I would definitely return just for the fried ice cream again!"

I believe Urban&#39;s kitchen is actually open until 1am. I was glad that someone was still serving food. 

Server was friendly. Bar area looked pretty busy with locals. Foodwise -- not the best Mexican food I&#39;ve had, but it was edible. 

I had a small queso dip which seemed like cheese wiz with a spoon of ground beef, and the Chicken Adovada entree. Nothing too crazy there -- I think I liked the refried beans the best on that plate. Didn&#39;t really care for the chicken too much -the spice was kinda weird. 

Complimentary basket of chips and salsa -- salsa I thought was too watered down. 

The prices I thought were very fair. Just water for me, but I did see draft beer on the menu for $2 -- which is pretty good. 

Even though the food was okay, I&#39;d still rather eat here than Applebee&#39;s."

It&#39;s not amazing and it&#39;s definitely not authentic Mexican food, but the portions are big and it&#39;s not too expensive. We went at 10PM on a Sunday night and started out with drinks. I was a little annoyed that I asked for a mango margarita and ended up getting the large size even though I hadn&#39;t specified and the waitress hadn&#39;t asked which size I wanted. I would think the assumption would be that I wanted the smaller size unless I said differently, but we didn&#39;t complain and just took the $2 charge (the large size is huge though, so I didn&#39;t finish it all). 

We ordered queso to go with the chips and salsa (which, as other reviews stated, were clearly just store-bought). I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the salsa, but the queso helped. We both got fajitas, which you can&#39;t really mess up. I got shrimp because the shrimp fajitas were cheaper than usual - the shrimp was marinated pretty well and tasted very good. The veggies on the side were ok, but nothing special. I pretty much just ate the shrimp. My boyfriend ate most of his fajitas, but he&#39;ll eat anything. Don&#39;t get me wrong - everything was fine, just nothing special. If you&#39;re stuck in the area though, go for it. It is open very late every night of the week! When we were there, there were a few tables eating but the bar was packed. It got very noisy right before we were leaving, including someone screaming (no idea why, but I&#39;m assuming a lot of drinks were consumed beforehand!). I&#39;m glad we left when we did!"

I visited this place since it&#39;s within walking distance of my temporary apartment, I kept driving by saying &#34;I should try this place out sometime&#34;.

I went in on a Sunday evening to have a beer and some food, I was alone.  As soon as I sat down at the bar I could tell that the place was full of cliques, most notably the wait staff who was more interested in chatting it up and checking each other out rather than attending to their guests, or at least they were to the ones that they knew.  I sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes before I motioned to the bartender that I was ready to order, even though he had looked at me about 15 times after I had read the menu and sat it down in front of me.

I ordered a beer and queso, the beer was okay, although the glass had that smell of sanitizer which killed the overall taste.  The queso looked like it had come out of a box, didn&#39;t really resemble good cheese due to the coloring and taste.

If you&#39;re looking for a good place, I would recommend Ted&#39;s Montana Grill across the street - they have good food, drinks and service."

I&#39;m pretty sure they make the salsa fresh daily and it had a good kick to it.  There was a pretty solid beer selection and a nice bartender.

The only issue with this place is since its in a hotel area near an airport, visiting it midweek you&#39;ll find yourself in a bar filled with men.  Which is ok if your a woman I guess ha.

Overall not a bad place to grab a drink."

We asked 4-5 times for chips and salsa and never received any. Food is about as plain and boring as it gets. Authentic is not in their vocabulary or customer service. No one in our group finished their food and we left and went to the Outback right behind them.

She asked if their was anything else she could do for us and hoped our visit was satisfactory. When the tip is coming all of a sudden they give a %^&amp;#.

I am soooo glad I trusted my fellow Yelpers and my gut instinct and tried this little gem. Dined here on a busy Sunday around 1:00. I had my best friends 9 year old daughter with me so we decided to have a quick brunch before going out for the day. My little buddy got a kids meal chicken tenders and fries and she loved it. 

I came here specifically for the banana bread french toast, as per the reviews. I was soooo terrified it would have nuts in it so right when we sat down I inquired about that and to my shock there were NO NUTS in the banana bread. AMENNN! Not due to an allergy but simply bc I hate nuts in my banana bread(I know some are shocked at me rn)

 I was starving mind you and was so excited about my BBFT that I didn&#39;t even look at the menu. My waitress was ADORABLE, unfortunately I cannot remember her name bc I&#39;m an ass. She asked if I would like to make my BBFT a combo, uh YES PLEASE! I asked for my 3 bacon to be on the softer side and 2 eggs scrambled. Food came out quite fast even though they were pretty busy. 

You guys.... IT WAS AMAZING. The BBFT came out in 2 over an inch thick slices with to-die-for cinnamon butter, and cooked perfectly eggy and crispy at the same time. ORDER YOURS WELL DONE IF YOU DONT LIKE EGG-Y FT!! Syrup was so deliciously warm on the side too it made my soul sing. Bacon was cooked to perfection and my eggs were great. I ate every last frickin bite of this meal. Contemplated licking the plate but didnt want to get judged LOL best breakfast I&#39;ve had in a LONG time and good service. I will be back ASAP!

I was wondering why I had forgot about this place and it was because the food was just so-so. 

The service is excellent and so is the ambiance, but breakfast here isn&#39;t anything to write home about.

This time I had the banana French toast, which were huge over one inch thick portions. They were a bit too sweet. I barely put any sugar in my banana bread, as the fruit is was makes the flavor, not the sugar. It was also soft on the bottom, but not soggy. I like my French toast crispy on the outside and on both sides while cooked on the inside.

My husband had the Med. omelette, which was a bit salty and greasy. Even though it is in a convenient location, we probably won&#39;t go back again. Call us spoiled I guess. We&#39;re fans of places like Blue Sky Cafe in Golden/Lakewood &amp; Turley&#39;s in Boulder. 

However, the prices at Goody&#39;s are reasonable. It just depends on what you want in a breakfast. Do you want high quality and great flavor or just regular food?"

I went into this restaurant with high expectations after reading all of the other Yelp reviews but it just fell short in every aspect.

As a vegetarian I asked for them to accommodate a plate so I ordered a vegetable skillet. After placing my order the food came out very quickly but that was to a fault. All of the food was undercooked and had no seasoning. The hash browns and all of the vegetables tasted raw and bland. The quality of the food was comparable to a Denny&#39;s or just another basic diner. 

I wish I could say I had a more positive experience with our waitress but that fell short as well. As soon as we were served our food she disappeared. We had to grab random waitresses if we wanted anything including our bill.

Honestly, I&#39;m really confused as to how their Yelp star rating is as high as it is."

Waited about 10 minutes for a table for 2. There really isn&#39;t a good waiting area, so we stood outside. Anyone who waits inside seems to get in the way of the people working (especially if it&#39;s a large group).

The service was fast and the food was delicious. I had the California Benedict which had good flavor and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The hash browns were good, but kind of plain. My fiancé had the banana bread french toast, which I tasted...and it was amazing. Such a great idea! Drinks are pretty cheap too. We had $4 mimosas (pear and peach, yum!). 

Overall, our meal and drinks only cost about $27 (without tip), which I think is pretty reasonable for breakfast. I&#39;d definitely go to Goody&#39;s again, but I wish they had a different layout for customers who are waiting."

     Prices are very reasonable. We got a table right away. The waitress was fine. However we felt like we were being a little rushed out. It was around 10 AM on a Saturday.  There were people waiting to be seated - so I  understand why she wanted to flip the table.

We didn&#39;t want to wait hours in line at Snooze or Egg and I so we decided to check this place out. It&#39;s a family owned small place that had a ton of people. The wait was about 5 minutes and we were quickly seated at the bar. Goody&#39;s served your typical American diner brunch food like omelets, waffles, biscuit and gravy. It&#39;s not a specialty place like Snooze so if you want your fancy benedicts or espresso coffees or bloody marys you can&#39;t find it here. But if you are down for a hearty brunch that will satisfy you well into dinner time, this is the place. 

I ordered fried chicken steak which comes with a side of biscuit and gravy. I appreciated that the steak came in bite sided pieces already so I didn&#39;t have to cut it. The chicken was topped with a layer of hash browns and gravy. I do have one complaint which is that the food came with way too much onions. I usually love onions but not when every bite has onion overload. Also the gravy was a bit much because it made me not even eat my biscuit and gravy because it was the same type of white gravy on both dishes. I should have gotten something else on the side. Also if you wanted to replace the biscuit with waffles, you have to purchase it separately..which is a bit silly because waffles don&#39;t cost that much. 

I would have given this place 4 stars for the portion of food (it was massive!) and the homey diner feeling but they took extraordinarily long to serve the food so I am taking a star off for that. Otherwise I did enjoy the meal and left very full."

After our meal was finished we lingered and continued our conversation. The waitress came and told us that another patron was picking up the bill for everyone in the restaurant! How cool is that?! We were already impressed but this was icing on the cake! 

Moving 1,000 miles away is very daunting. This was our first outing in the area and it was an awesome experience. I&#39;m hoping the rest of Denver metro has such amazing people (and food!).

Cheers, friends!"

Although things move fast and seem to me people are respectful and they don&#39;t linger to wait for their food to reach their small intestine. So the wait is pretty reasonable. If you are not attached to the idea of eating at a table then grab one of the spot in the counter. Bam!

Perusing their menu this quietly unique Banana Bread French Toast Combo caught my eye. It is two huge signature pieces of their banana bread dipped in sweet egg batter and grilled. Topped with cinnamon butter. Served with two eggs any style and two pieces honey cured bacon or sausage. $8.25.

Now when they say big they meant thick not wide. I personally like girth the best. Lol! So yeah this was in my favor from the start. The cinnamon butter on top was the icing on the girth. My inner fatty definitely came out here and partied! The bacon was thick and salty and crunchy. The eggs made just the way I ordered it. Over easy!

So yeah! If you&#39;re up for a girthy pleasure do drop by!l"

The steak &amp; eggs was cooked to order but a little tough, took extra chewing but tasted great.
Hash browns are the sliced not shredded kind with a great crisp that is just right. Two small pancakes were delicious! Tried a side of green chili and it rocks! Just the right heat but not overpowering.
Customer service from &#34;Danny&#34; was a five star performance! Spot on checking in and delivering a warm welcome.
Next return visit to Colorado, Good&#39;s will be on my radar!
I will try the steak again in hopes the cut was just one of those &#34;off&#34; things."

Biscuits and gravy (no sausage included in the gravy) were good, the biscuits were fluffy and tender. The gravy was substantial and creamy, an overall good home style cream gravy. The banana bread French toast-- for most people, this is probably a great dish, and it really is quite good. I&#39;d personally like it if they offered a smaller portion. For me, it&#39;s lacking, but only because I&#39;ve had the absolute best Banana bread French toast at a place in Wichita, KS. The cooks could easily take this up a few notches with the addition of whipped cream, possibly nuts, and a more substantial battered type crust. Regular maple syrup was offered for topping, but a decadent dish like this deserves a special kind of syrup-- butter pecan syrup, perhaps? Our sausage and eggs were as expected, all good. The country fried steak is certainly in the top ten I&#39;ve ever had, and is a definite will-order-again item. A little more spice to it would take it into the next level! All in all, I would definitely eat here again."

The building is unassuming and if you aren&#39;t looking for it you&#39;ve probably driven past it countless times. Parking was adequate for the busyness inside of the restaurant. We were seated immediately by friendly service personnel. Everyone was decked out in Broncos gear for game day, employees and patrons alike.
The kid&#39;s menu was fun, yet slightly expensive and the rest of the food was enjoyed by the entire party. The pancakes, eggs and fruit I indulged in was slightly above average.
Service was fast enough, but being seated in the booth near the kitchen was a bit awkward and loud.
I really wanted to like Goody&#39;s more. They are docked a star for not offering raw sugar and the white stuff makes me not even want to drink coffee (or spend my money on it). The performance was very close to four star and I may return to Goody&#39;s, but will likely opt to go to Huckleberry in Louisville or Westminster Egg &amp; I for options that are more suited to my tastes and needs."

I&#39;m not a big salt person, but even adding it didn&#39;t help this dish, and the white gravy was bland, with no flavor.

 The service was just the right amount of perfect..  Our waiter was attentive and friendly but not over bearing. 

The overall feel of the people and decor give a happy upbeat kinda morning you want to wake up to.. It&#39;s a more happy environment. 

I ordered the Californian eggs benadict and was a change but oh such a good change..  Testing waters on new things is not always a win bit this morning it was a double win.  Hollandaise was on point and eggs cooked perfectly. I didn&#39;t even need to salt or pepper..  Taste was on from the start. 
Tried a biscuit and was pretty good as well as my wife&#39;s scrambled eggs.. 
The hashbrowns were cooked well with minimal greasy to them which is rare in my finds..  Ungreasy and properly cooked hash Browns..  My hat off to the cooks here..  They know their stuff. 

Check arrived perfectly and we were very happy with a first time experience here..  Will be coming  again..

Details:
Found this little gem while visiting family this past December. It was so good we had to visit twice in the short time we had there, I wish I could have eaten there every morning but I&#39;d probably gain 20lbs. and most of us aren&#39;t normally breakfast eaters.

The staff is extremely friendly, and I just wish I could remember my server&#39;s name, she did have stars tattooed behind her ear and she was just wonderful and very accommodating. She gave us some helpful advice on good local attractions and even what sort of souvenir to bring back, where to get it, etc. I never had to ask for refills, she was always on it, and made some good suggestions for our breakfast orders. 

The Food! I am a huge fan of eggs, and was craving them like crazy on our trip (found out when we got back home that I was in the first few weeks of pregnancy!), and I have to say, best eggs ever! Dragged the rest of the family on the second visit and they agreed. In Hawaii we usually eat our eggs with white rice, and this was my first time without that option, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would find it palatable but I went ahead and put my perfectly cooked over-easies &amp; hash browns on the delicious sourdough toast, sprinkled some hot sauce over the top and had my entire plate cleared in a few minutes wishing for a bigger stomach. (Oink oink)

Boyfriend had the PB&amp;J pancakes, he is the pickiest eater in the world so I was shocked he&#39;d try something kind of out there for us, but he really loved them. He also has to have his bacon cooked burnt (really crispy), and of course, perfect both times.  

The cost was low, though we tend to pay about twice as much in Hawaii so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s comparable to other eateries in Colorado; truthfully I felt like I was underpaying for what we got. Guess we made up for it in tipping :) Service like that, the waitresses deserve it. 

It&#39;s a very clean and modern take on the classic diner, lighting is just right, seating was comfortable. 

Unfortunately the fam is moving back to Arizona so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever get another visit, perhaps on a road trip someday."

Ive brought several of my friends here who are now also regulars. I love their fresh baked banana bread and potaoes (weird but its how my mom used to make them). 
It is a small family owned business so if your looking for a flashy modern place like Snooze THIS ISNT IT and that&#39;s why I love it here. 
It has a very &#34;homely&#34; atmosphere. It is a bit smaller but I think that&#39;s what keeps it a great place."

A HUGE plus is how clean the place is. 

We&#39;ve been here twice and our server,Judy has helped us both times. Ask for her for a pleasant dining experience, guaranteed. The coffee is great and they have biscuits and gravy &amp; banana French toast. Yum!"

I&#39;ve been in search of the best breakfast restaurant, and I got hopeful with Grandy&#39;s. Low prices, decent decor, and tasty food? It sounded too good to be true, and to my disappointment, it was.

I&#39;ve give Goody&#39;s a couple of things. The restaurant is a cute breakfast spot - definitely nicer than your local Waffle House. They took good care of our table, ensuring that coffees and waters were always full. And I&#39;ll say that everyone else I dined with loved their meals (a breakfast skillet and a breakast burrito. However, they missed the mark with me.

My first annoyance with this place is pretty minor and is just a matter of personal preference, so I tried not to factor this into the overall ratings. I love breakfast food, but I absolutely hate eggs in every form. Scrambled? Over-easy? Fried? Not interested. Since it&#39;s hard to find a breakfast dish that doesn&#39;t come with eggs, I usually just order a regular plate but ask for something simple instead of eggs - usually a slice of toast, unless I&#39;m offered more exciting options (I&#39;ll never say no to another slice of bacon...). When I asked our waitress, she said that absolutely no substitutions were allowed. For me, that was a bummer.

However, the reason for my three star review wasn&#39;t that. It was that simply nothing I ate was good. The coffee was very weak. My belgian waffle arrived dense and soggy, not crispy and fluffy, and my side order of hash brows tasted completely unseasoned. That last one was easily remedied by a decent sprinkling of salt and pepper, and were admittedly quite good once they tasted a bit less bland. 

I&#39;ll give Goody&#39;s another try. Everyone else in my party thought it was a great find, but I&#39;m not convinced yet."

I am giving two stars based on the pretty good green chili and the friendly waitress, otherwise i would give one star. The biscuits are your basic Sysco frozen product, gravy bland and not homemade, not served hot. Pancakes cold and like that of any chain breakfast joint. They are proud of their hasbrowns which i found to be the majority of what was on my plate. They too were bland and undercooked. Disappointed to say the least. It&#39;s not that hard to cook fresh food that tastes good. Wont return!"

I&#39;ve never much cared for green chile. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve never had the good stuff. . . until now. It was spicy, and wonderful, and perfectly complemented that damn burrito.

As previous reviews mention,  don&#39;t judge this place by its location or outward appearance --- it&#39;s nicely decorated inside and the bathrooms are renovated and pristine. 

We ordered the egg white omelette, a sausage breakfast burrito and pancakes to share. My omelette came with my choice of a biscuit and gravy on the side which was delicious,  just like the omelette. My husband said his burrito was &#34;great&#34; and we both enjoyed the pancakes (although I like actual maple syrup better).

Definitely the place to go for a well done breakfast and the prices are reasonable!"

While I didn&#39;t get a poor quality of service, I definitely did not receive the type of exceptional service that is usually experienced when dining with another patron or in a group.  I am used to my server checking in on me to see how everything is after I eat and dropping of the check quickly after it appears I am finished. 
With that being said, this is the ONLY complaint I have about my experience. 
My server was sweet and quick to take my order. The food arrived promptly. The house-made Banana Bread French Toast was sweet, but not too sweet, moist but not soggy, had enough spice in the bread itself and in the egg batter, and was a rather pleasing portion. The sausage was ok. I&#39;m super picky about my sausage so I can&#39;t complain about it since I am so biased. The eggs were truly cooked to the over-medium that I ordered them [I HATE RUNNY WHITES!!] but the yolk was still nice and smooth. The hot cocoa wasn&#39;t too sweet and was very creamy. 
So other than waiting for my check and not being checked on during my meal, this place was rather excellent. I&#39;ll probably be back. Multiple times. And I&#39;m sure that next time it will be even more impressive."

I got there on a Saturday morning around 9:30 a.m. and was immediately seated.   I was expecting a bit more of a crowd.  Our waitress arrived within a few minutes and took the drink order.  I decided on the country skillet with a side of biscuits and gravy.  It took less than 10 minutes to get the food.  Be aware that you will get a lot of food here.  I could barely eat a third of it before it was too much.  I found the food to be okay.  The gravy wasn&#39;t the best that I had and the hashbrowns were a bit bland.  I was expecting something better based on the reviews.

Our waiter David was amazing! He gave us enough attention that we didn&#39;t have to ask for refills and enough privacy that we could truly enjoy our date night dining experience.

Of course, we enjoyed a glass of Pinot Nior.  My friend treated so not sure of the label.  We both were so happy that we stopped in after hearing and reading so many good reviews.

I have been in thrall of his cooking for two plus decades, so I felt like my prayers had been answered when he returned to the Denver restaurant scene, which he largely defined for many years, and brought us Desmond. 

This is some of the best of Sean Kelly in one fantastic, intimate, neighborhood restaurant. By some of the best I mean so far. He&#39;s still got his mojo and then some, and plenty of new and foodgasmic experiences for many years to come. 

There is something for everyone on this menu, whether you are an omnivore, paleo, vegan, or vegetarian. As with all of Kelly&#39;s restaurants, everyone&#39;s diets are accommodated and expertly so. I have thus far had the olives, the baba ganouj, the hummus, the guac, the beet carpaccio, the brussels sprouts, and the broken falafel salad. My fellow diners have moaned over all of the meat and fish dishes.  It is impossible to choose a favorite when each one is so amazing, so perfect, so foodgasmic, so Sean Kelly. 

And well-priced, especially given the incredible quality of ingredients, the service, the excellent portions, and the fantastic service. Desmond, like every Sean Kelly restaurant, is superb. 

Our finicky, micro-eating 12 year old daughter inhaled everything vegetarian on the menu and then had seconds. There is no greater recommendation anyone can give a restaurant than the enthusiastic two thumbs up of a moody, picky, non-foodie tween girl...except that of a thrilled, long-time devotee. May we have many more years of Desmond, of Sean Kelly, and his incredible staff."

Good service, although they forgot our rosemary almonds we ordered when we first were asked. All good was tasty and of  good quality, but something in the flavor department was a little lacking. 

My husband got the steak and it was cooked to perfect specifications and I got the fennel muscles. For dessert we got the seasonal strawberry shortcake, but the shortcake was really just biscuits. That I didn&#39;t love. Our drinks were ok but even for someone who loves dry wines the margarita and pomegranate gimlet were lacking some hint of sweet.

I would come back but more so because it&#39;s in walking distance to where I live and nice service/ambiance and good but not amazing"

We came again on a random Thursday and were able to get a table right away. We decided to get several share plates and loved each one! We tried the guacamole, hummus, burger, French onion tart, and fried Brussels sprouts. The onion tart was especially delicious and the Brussels sprouts were probably the best we&#39;ve ever had! And our server recommended a peach and cream dessert that wasn&#39;t printed on the menu, and we&#39;re so glad we tried it.

This is such a great, local place and we&#39;ll be back soon to check out what&#39;s new and seasonal."

The plate sizes were quite small, and a little challenging to share with a group of 4. Some items only came with 3 of something, or a very small spoonful. I also think the staff didn&#39;t guide us very well regarding which dishes were best to share- he simply told us to share everything. The wings were a big hit with the men. Good flavor and plenty of them. The brussels sprouts and polenta were very good too. It&#39;s a neighborhood eatery so we will be back, but we will be more aware on what we order to split with a larger group."

We walked to the area knowing there were a few restaurants on this corner. To our pleasant surprise, it was not what we expected. At 6pm on a Friday night, the place was packed but we were still able to get a table for two. All in all the food was delicious. I see other reviewers&#39; complaints that the menu doesn&#39;t make sense and that they could not determine what was a small plate and what was not. I LOVED this about the menu. Personally, I enjoy going somewhere new and trying lots of things on the menu. This is a wonderful place for sharing (I would absolutely consider this more of a small plate restaurant). The had the hummus, wings, crispy brussel sprouts, mussels and the marscarpone polenta. The polenta was one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten and would go back just for that!

My only complaints are the noise level (very loud for one on one conversation) and the table sizes are a little small and very close together. This is not a good spot for a romantic dinner for two in my opinion. Like I said, this is a great place to share and try a little of everything."

Lamb sausage was incredible, n&#39;duga was really good (2nd time having it). B-sprouts were overdone, but still tasty, perhaps not worth $10 though.  I&#39;m excited to come back and try more items off the menu. 

Drink prices are slightly above average for a small neighborhood spot.  

Energy of the place is still a little off, but they are new, so give them a chance or two.  Overstaffed, music too low, etc.  are the complaints.

My cocktail, vodka, ginger beer and cider was great for a summer night. My complaint and why I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars was the non-stop habit of all the various servers, runners, etc asking and reaching to remove plates.

The food is pretty good, the portions are ample and the prices are fair. But the owners put a new sign up on the former Table Top and called it good. We swore off Table Top because of the noise. We literally could not hear our server, or each other on a busy night. On a Tuesday night, this was not a problem at Desmonds, fortunately for us. The place is rather dark with a lower ceiling. Even with the garage door open it&#39;s not an inviting interior. We ordered 4 shareable plates: warm asparagus, potted salmon, mascarpone polenta, and the falafel salad. For two people, this was overkill by 2 plates. It would have been nice for the server to give us a heads up. After we finished we learned the menu is ordered from light to heavy. Also good to know. Sadly, we had no room for dessert. All 4 dishes were flavorful. The salmon (with grilled toast---yum!) and polenta stood out. We tried a few cocktails: mortoni and denver sour. I liked both. My wife thought the mortoni with both compari and grapefruit was too much tart. The service was fine. Never felt we were waiting too long, questions were all answered, water refilled, etc. Not inspired, but completely adequate. I imagine it&#39;s hard to attract the A-team to work outside of RiNo or Highlands. It is refreshing to not have a parking challenge like in those neighborhoods. Loved that. I hope they do well and invest more in the interior to give it that energy and appeal it&#39;s lacking."

We live in the area and tried to come right after Desmond first opened, for happy hour, but there was no happy hour (I understand there is now). Then we tried to come last week, thinking &#34;Where is a great neighborhood place we could go to celebrate some good news?&#34; 

I thought it might be busy, so I called to ask if they would have room for us, or if I could make a reservation before we headed over in about half an hour. (It was a weekday night.) The hostess said it should be no problem and we should come on in - no reservation necessary. But when we arrived in about 35 minutes, around 6:30, she told us there was at least a half-hour wait. (Lots of empty tables behind her.) I exclaimed that we had called and she had said we could come in! and she said harshly that she couldn&#39;t predict when people could come in, and it had filled up. I said that if we&#39;d known, we would have reserved a table, and she said &#34;Well there aren&#39;t any tables available right now anyway. The first one isn&#39;t till 7. You can sit at the bar if you want.&#34; Then she just stared at us while we decided. We didn&#39;t want to sit at the (empty) bar with our kid, and we didn&#39;t want to stand around for half an hour when we could have -- given the opportunity -- made a reservation for 7:00 and waited in comfort at home. 

Two strikes -- don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll try again. We wish there was a nice neighborhood in the area, but meanwhile we wound up elsewhere -- again."

I live in the neighborhood, and was sad when Tabletop closed and left this lovely space empty, it&#39;s great to see it full again! We tried it on a whim on Friday night, and were pleased to see that the dining room was full and busy.

Prices are great, perfect for a slightly upscale neighborhood establishment. The food is good, all small plates meant to be shared. The antipasto plate was a great mix of flavors, the onion chevre tart is a must. It&#39;s clear that the menu is being tweaked and refined, but what a great start! I can&#39;t wait to see how it grows and evolves. 

The wine list was decent, and the cocktails are great. The Denver Sour was one of the best whiskey sours I&#39;ve had.   

Our service was very good. Everyone, from the hostess to the bussers were pleasant, smiled and greeted us. The dining room is cozy, well designed and comfortable. Of course, it&#39;s winter now, and we can&#39;t enjoy the great outdoor space yet, but I&#39;m looking forward to walking in for after work cocktails outside next summer!

We had a group of 7 and service was glacially slow. Cocktails came out one at a time over the course of 15 minutes. The menu is confusing. Desmond bills itself as Mediterranean with shared plates. But, the best items our group tried were the burger and chicken wings. The only other high point was the onion and chèvre tart. Yummy. The squid was so chewy it was almost inedible. The hummus suffered from too much tahini. The polenta lacked flavor. The baba ghanoush was sweet. Doubt we&#39;ll be back."

We were traveling cross country and the family visiting suggested Changs.  We made a reservation...that got lost.  Tired from traveling, hungry, and generally peeved that  the hostess did not seem to care, I unloaded on the &#34;operating partner&#34; (I believe this is Changs code for the General Manager).  He was very kind, ridiculously patient and got us sat quickly.

After this hiccup, the experience was fantastic.  The manager checked back constantly, dedicated to making sure we were happy.  We spent much of dinner discussing how rare it is to find hospitality folks working so hard to recover from a small mistake.

All in all, it was a four star experience - we showed up expecting a table and was told it would be a 30 minute wait.  But, the staff&#39;s efforts to make things right earns then that fifth star.  

To those that have left bad reviews...talk to management, give them the feedback and they will make it right!"

I&#39;ve always held the firm belief that a hostess should be friendly and welcoming. Well, not TONIGHT at this PFC! I&#39;m not too worried about it though, I come here all the time, and I am pretty confident that Little Miss Attitude will be working elsewhere by the time I come back next.

For example I was in earlier tonight to pick up my to go order and was told to go to the bar to pick up the food.  The poor bartender was not only working the entire bar area as a bar tender and a server but also was working food pickup while quite a few of his coworkers stood behind the host stand or talked with their friends at a table. 
I still like their food but management should address streamlining their service issues.

Also on a possibly unrelated note the food was cold when I got home."

They do have a gluten free menu that I had ordered from and the food was good however I think they have MSG in their food and am not sure if it was entirely gluten free .. I had the lettuce wraps.. And I told the waiter it was an allergy but something made me extremely sick .. I haven&#39;t been back since .. Their food is overly salty and I feel like I need gallons of water and still feel like I haven&#39;t had enough ... They are a little slow on service but are attentive ..

The food was just all right, I noticed they have reduced the portion on the popular lettuce wrap and the hot and sour soup was way salty.  The service however was terrible.  No refill on water, the server did not ever come back on her own but had to be sought out.  The bill took 15 minutes to appear after we asked for it, it was another 20 minutes and 2 reminders for a doggie bag.  No fortune cookies with the bill and she acted like it was a bother.  It was not just us the table next to us was having the same experience.  Her tip started out at 6$ and I took away 1$ for every 10 minutes we waited for her after we had finished, there was 2$ left.

However, last night we came in around 5:00 for an early dinner (service in the bar was great, as always), when we noticed a young lady come in (I&#39;m assuming for her shift) who proceeded to plop down her purse, whip out a shirt and an apron and &#34;change&#34; into her work clothes at the hostess stand (as customers were coming in for dinner).

They offered a perfect walk up without a reservation and we frankly had the option of dining inside the beautiful main hall or outside the wonderful breezy outdoor hall. Our choice was the tables outside because not only was the weather great, they had these blue satin silk curtains that waved in the wind and made us feel relaxed and it gave off a romantic atmosphere for us, the two, who were on a date. The servers were always on top of their game and had yet to disappoint us. They had amazing customer service skills and poured us some wine, they were never late on our appetizer or entrees. We sat next to this huge, wide and long table that were filled with more wonderful people. They took a photo, and my date totally photo bombed them and made us all laugh, so you could say P.F. Chang&#39;s was a grand time for all of us. The best thing a server could offer you in any dining experience, is to make you laugh.

I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wrap as my entree.  The server mixed the hot mustard and hot chili paste in a light soy sauce mixture.

My husband ordered the Dan Dan Noodles.  His entree actually went really well as the filling of my lettuce wrap.  The entree was supposed to be spicy so my husband used some of my sauce

Its literally never the same, almost laughable, and pretty darn frustrating. Its also overly salty and sweet. I&#39;m also not a fan of the pricing, its really over-priced food for what it is, and although the appetizers are the best food on the menu, they are a complete rip-off.

PF Chang is no longer a Chinese restaurant, it&#39;s serving a variety of Asian food.  Just imagine a restaurant try to be mediocre to below average cooking a large menu, the result is a very over priced food for some poor quality food.  The quality of the food is equivalent of regular Chinese buffet.  The only thing the restaurant kept up was the ambience.  We stopped using this restaurant altogether."

Our server came to get our drink order and complained about being at work during a Broncos game. Umm okay....

To start the meal, we ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and pork pot stickers. Our server then came back several minutes later to take our orders for the main course- orange chicken, broccoli and beef, and the chile green beans. This is about the last thing our server did right. Rather than our appetizers coming out, he came to drop off the green beans. We asked where the appetizers were and he said, &#34;You wanted the green beans as an appetizer.&#34; We explained that we ordered our green beans with the main courses as an additional side. Rather than just fixing the order, he proceeded to grab his manager in an attempt to justify his actions.

After we finally got the situation sorted out and received our appetizers, he still brought the green beans well ahead of our meal. Our server then began to hover over us during our entire meal. Weirdest and most uncomfortable experience."

That&#39;s the only reason this review has 3 stars. She apparently needs to take lessons from him or get a new job. Not only that but after our table was taken from her she kept talking about it in the corner with other people she worked with. Totally unprofessional.

We are repeat customers for their $39.99 dinner for two deal, which actually works out pretty well for the whole family. We have two very young kids who eat very little and a baby who doesn&#39;t factor in to the food picture yet.

OK, so here it is. The hubby and I have never liked PF Changs (it just never thrilled us). We have lived next to this one for 2.5 years and today is the first time we stepped in the place, but we did so because of the gluten free items (the hubby has to be GF because of allergies, so we have to choose wisely now). 

The good: They have a whole back menu from apps to dessert that is gluten free! Score. They even offer gluten free soy sauce. Wow. Major plus. And the food was tasty, no weird flavors (if you have eaten gluten free you know what I mean). Not to mention I always like it when I can order brown rice. Unfortunately, the good ends there. 

The bad: Service was terrible. We were seated at a table and forgotten for 10 minutes until a random waitress asked if we had been helped and finally took our drink and food order (since we had so much time to decide and we had her we figured we should put both in). Then we waited for at least another 5 minutes for drinks. The food came out 5 minutes after that...so we got our food faster than drinks essentially. Wow, how crappy do you have to be to do that. Then we had to flag down people to get a refill. The food itself was tasty, but nothing that would bring me back, plus the portions are small. Oh and as we left, 3 hostesses were at the front and not one said thank you or even good bye. Jeez, not really pulling me back in. 

Bottom line: We will probably come back because of the gluten free options, but we might opt for take out and not dine in."

I&#39;ve never, ever wanted to be a &#39;eunuc&#39;(h)... ever).

I had high hopes as we waltzed through the front doors and were seated immediately (again, reservations... yes, smart, do it, you need to), but then... we just kinda sat there. And sat there. And sat there. And then this skinny little man-boy came over and pretended to know what he was doing, though all he did was ask if we wanted water and didn&#39;t come back again for a very long while. So, finally, we got to order our drinks. Or so we thought. I should&#39;ve known when I asked his opinion on which wine would go best with the food we had ordered and he said, &#34;I have no idea!&#34; Fast forward half a lifetime. Our server comes back with my brother&#39;s iced tea and no bottle of wine. He told us that the name on the menu didn&#39;t match with the name in the cellar with the name on the bottle with his mother&#39;s cousin&#39;s sister&#39;s maiden name, etc. Whatever. We eventually got our wine. Emphasis on eventually. Emphasis on eventually on ALL parts of our meal. Like our starter soups... which came out lukewarm... and our entrees, which came out after a half glass of nursing wine... and our desserts, which came out without forks... it was really just hilarious all around. Or maybe that was just the wine.

I&#39;m always partial to the orange peel chicken, but everyone in my family has their own favorite (I&#39;ve tried my brother&#39;s Singapore street noodles, and there&#39;s a coconut shrimp dish to die for).

The service has always been good, and the food is consistently good given that it&#39;s a chain restaurant. I love how they package up the take-away food right at the table for you, and the servers always chat when they spend time at the table. It makes it less rushed and informal, no matter how busy the restaurant. 

Always a good choice, if you&#39;re at the mall and planning to eat."

Great for celebrating birthdays, or just a date night. They have amazing food, the appetizers are the best. This place has the best calamari and lettuce wraps in the area. The sushi always tastes fresh and we have always had great service, even when we come in with groups of 20+

The wait can be insane at times, but we always go in for either lunch or after 7 and we never wait. We have made reservations before for our large groups and were always seated right away. 

It&#39;s a little pricy but the portions are large and we usually leave with left overs. They have a ton of options for gluten free meals as well."

We were welcomed and accommodated and were seated with no problem. We had a group of seven and got there during a busy time and only had to wait about 10-15 minutes. 
The waitress was average, she took a little long to bring our drinks and our check, otherwise she did her job. Everyone in my group enjoyed their food, but we all agree that it was nothing to call home about. 

Would I go back? Yes, if somebody invited me or if I had a coupon. However, the likelihood of me going back on my own, SLIM."

We walked in and were seated and were promptly ignored for 10 minutes until a random waitress asked if someone else had come taken our drink order yet. She took it and about 5 minutes or so later someone finally came back with it and took our order.

The food was decent, but the service definitely sucked. As we were leaving there were 3 or 4 hostesses yakking it up at the entrance and not one of them even acknowledged our existence as we left.

Located at the front of Southlands Mall, it&#39;s definitely hard to miss. The inside has the usual decor, which I enjoy, but am not sure how the full wall Chinese mural matches with the log-cabin decor. 

We were seated right away at 6pm on a Sunday, despite it looking like every table was taken. Our waitress quickly arrived to take our drinks and was kind enough to come back shortly after we had actually had a chance to open our menus. Drinks were ordered and not delivered for about 10 minutes. Our order was taken about 15 minutes after that, though thankfully the food was quick to arrive. 

We had their prix fixe menu special, which appears to be a great deal. To start, we had the hot and sour soup. There are lots of chicken and mushrooms in the bowl, which made every spoonful delicious. Depending on how many leftovers you would like from the evening, I would recommend a 1/2 cup full as that&#39;s still tons. 

As an appetizer we had the chicken lettuce wraps. These are always a favorite and it&#39;s extremely hard to finish them. I enjoy the sauce that the servers mix for you, though find it always just drips on to my plate. When we asked to package up the leftover filling, our server came back with a Ziploc bag of extra lettuce for us to continue the feast. 

For entrees, we had the Mongolian beef and the almond and cashew chicken. You get your choice of white or brown rice and are sure to go home with leftovers for another full meal. I&#39;ve also tried their Cantonese shrimp and found that to be wonderful. Their list of entrees for you to choose from is quite extensive, though doesn&#39;t offer many vegetarian choices. 

And dessert. You get your choice of a small shot glass of dessert, with 10 kinds to choose from. I had the lemon meringue and with layers of graham crumbs, lemon curd, and whipping cream, it was the perfect end to the meal. 

Expect to leave quite full, whether you go for this meal deal or order a la cart. I&#39;m still unsure if meals are meant to be ordered and shared like traditional Chinese restaurants, as patrons all appeared to have their own plates they were chowing down on. Your choice?"

For the prices  this place charges, I was expecting a LOT more in regards to service, portions, quality, taste, and dining experience. When you spend over 40 bucks, you kind of expect it to be worthwhile.  

For starters, my husband ordered a margarita which came in a plain water glass with no garnish and mostly ice, for the &#34;special happy hour&#34; price of $6.50.  Total rip off! The waitress even echoed our dismay with an embarrassed, &#34;Yeah, our drinks aren&#39;t very cheap.&#34; 

For dinner we ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and Chang&#39;s Spicy Chicken.  When the server (different person than our waitress) brought out the food, we honestly did a double take. The portions were PATHETICALLY small.  I was stunned for a moment.  I surprised myself when I said out loud to the server, &#34;THIS is the main dish??&#34; (Maybe he brought us someone&#39;s appetizer by mistake?). He replied, &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s really good!&#34;  

Now, to be clear,  we are NOT gluttons who pile mountains of food on our plates.  It&#39;s just that each time we&#39;ve dined at oriental restaurants, we&#39;ve always had enough to take leftovers home. Not at this place! FOR THE PRICES - the portion sizes here are just appalling.  Two &#34;platters&#34; (their &#34;platter&#34; is smaller than a dinner plate) of chicken with more plate showing than chicken and a tiny bowl of rice for each...for $30 bucks?  Seriously??  

Honestly, the chicken we were served looked and tasted just like the same packaged frozen stuff we buy across the street at Sam&#39;s club, except tossed with PF&#39;s sauces which, by the way, were overpowering and truly unpleasant with huge, pungent chunks of ginger and garlic all through them both. Panda Express makes better food than this place.  And for 1/8 the price, too.

And the service?  Maybe I&#39;m old fashioned, but what has happened to elegant dining? Are we now such a casual culture that you can&#39;t find a graceful dining experience in a &#34;fancy&#34; restaurant?  Certainly the high prices and fancy décor at PF&#39;s were enough to make us EXPECT an elegant dining experience.  But the wait staff acted like they worked at Denny&#39;s...which pretty much spoils the experience. 

The manager passed by our table at the end of our meal and casually asked if everything was good and I just couldn&#39;t pretend. She seemed surprised and went on and on about how good they really were (as if that would change our experience) and gave us some vouchers for a complimentary appetizer for next time.  (We would have preferred a markdown on the meal.)  She asked my husband, &#34;You will try us again, won&#39;t you?&#34;  Classy man that he is, he managed a weak smile said, &#34;Perhaps&#34;.  Fact is, we will not be back."

1. Our soup arrived cold - our server took it back and heated it in microwave, still we could tell that the soup is stale. The explanation was that someone turned off steam heater in the kitchen. 

2. The chairs are so close and no space to walk in between - the whole time I had to sit very uncomfortably.

3. The dishes were nothing special - they tasted worse than your average Panda express

I remember the PF Changs at Park Meadows to be much better ( haven&#39;t gone in couple of years) - it could be problem with how the Southlands PF Changs is being run or it could be that the quality has taken backseat at PF Changs.

Would not recommend the Southlands location - save your money and time - go elsewhere."

We tried the avocado toast, pork slider, fried pickles, and burger slider off the happy hour snack menu.  We also got the bacon wrapped dates off the appetizer menu and the kids tried the grilled cheese, grilled ckicken tenders, garlic smashers, and marinated beans.  The pork slider, burger slider, fried pickles, and bacon wrapped dates were very good.  However, the rest of the food seemed like they tried to hard to make it different with their spin on it and it only resulted in not tasting as good as it could have.
For example, our kids like have simple palates.  So, marinated the grilled chicken tenders in pickle juice, so much so that they had a green tint actually, soaking the beans in vinegar and onions, and the grilled cheese was even a stronger cheese than kids are usually use to eaten.  It would be preferable to keep kids meals simple and what they would expect instead of trying to make them so colorful tasting.  But it may just be our kids.
However, the bacon wrapped dates were full of interesting flavors like us adults like.  They were really awesome.  They are rather small and if looking for ways to improve these, it would be nice to get 4 of these for the $7.

I suppose considering the location (nestled between a few hotels) it fits. I saw a few just out of work peeps grabbing a cocktail and snack. I saw tourists with kids in tow out for a less formal din din. Milk shakes for kidlets and cocktails for mom and dad. 
I saw a couple of young hipsters on a first date. (Body language and awkwardness...dead giveaway) 

Locals give this micro franchise mixed reviews. 
I thought the food was well above average for a casual- sorta -hipster- family -burger -beer trufoods kinda joint. 

Competition in this little complex is stiff. So I see how it must appeal to a variety of clients. 

I didn&#39;t order the dinner selections, it seemed too wield to order foo foo food in a basket with wax paper. But the build a burger was excellent. I haven&#39;t had a burger in 6 months so I gave it a go.

The arugula, pickles, tomatoes, garlic aioli never get mentioned in a review. But they shined in this burger. I could brag and say I created an Umami moment by ordering each of them to accompany the Swiss and mushrooms, but this was a perfect balance. So as bits and pieces fell out I started tasting individual bits. Finally!  a tomato with taste! Arugula was sweet, peppery and  lemony. The garlic aioli smooth rich balanced not too garlicy. And the pickles, nice crisp spicy and snappy.

I didn&#39;t use ketchup, mustard salt or pepper (except added wee bit of salt on the kale chips I had instead of fries) even the onion was perfect not to acidic (aka being cut and left out on a counter all day). 

Perhaps the growth and proliferation of this place is not so much the ambiance, but the quality of the ingredients and the care assembling each meal.

They have a nice selection of items on their menu and bonus points for designating everything GF (gluten-free), V (vegetarian), DF (dairy-free). Love when a menu makes things early for those who are on restrictive diets. 

I opted for the greek salad. The portion was small for the cost, but it was presented well with hummus and taziki. This salad definitely could have used some pita or some of the delightful toasted bread that came with my coworkers tomato soup.

Tried the bacon wrapped dates and loved them but was sad there were only three -hard to share with just one other person unless you agree beforehand &#34;the first to fork the third gets it&#34;. 

I went for the dry aged cheeseburger. While tasty I would say it really wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had.  The garlic smashers sounded interesting-fingerling potatoes that are smashed, fried with garlic and Parmesan.  Tasty but kind of disgusting to look at. They just don&#39;t look appetizing.  

They talked about a lobster roll special so we pressed that to try.  Lots of lobster good flavor and the arugula was tasty that was with it.

We stopped by here for desserts because we stayed in the hotel in the same shopping area.  

I ordered the Chocolate Mousse.  The waitress, Jennifer, really sold the night&#39;s &#34;Special Dessert&#34; to my wife.  &#34;Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Bites Deep Fried.  Hot and Yummy.  I like it with a side of Ice Cream!&#34;  

Later, a waiter (I didn&#39;t catch his name) came by and dropped off our desserts.  Mine was a tiny mousse and my wife&#39;s was two scoops of vanilla ice cream and a brown bag (see picture).  I laughed so hard that I about fell out of the booth.  Yup, the bag contained my wife&#39;s dessert, but they sure looked like regular old cookies.  They tasted like regular old cookies too (Well, actually they weren&#39;t very good cookies.  They didn&#39;t taste very fresh).  They sure weren&#39;t &#34;Hot and Yummy!&#34;  Jennifer ran out quickly, apologizing, carrying the correct dessert a few minutes later (see 2nd picture).

The place seems like a good place for a family with children because the ambience was very casual with a dive bar (We noticed that this is common in Denver).  The menu had a little bit of everything.  Overall, a memorable story and average desserts. 

**Update**  I was just told that the cookies are Gluten free from a local bakery."

It&#39;s close to my house and they have good happy hour pricing so I end up here quite a bit. A few things, 1) they don&#39;t have ginger ale. So no whiskey ginger, which is my drink. 2) the beet burger is good, but half the time the coleslaw has HUGE pieces of red onion and nobody wants to bite into that. 3) their cocktails are tiny. Like reeeeeeally really small."

Service was top-notch for a casual dining experience, but I wish they had more beers on tap than they do - I actually changed my mind from just having water and wanted a beer after seeing their big beer logos near the ceiling, but nothing on their 6-8 beer list tantalized enough to have it.  I have heard at least some places in the CityPub area allow you to make an order, go to World of Beer and they&#39;ll bring you your food when it&#39;s done - maybe that&#39;d be the smarter way to go here.

In any case, dem fish tacos...mmmmm *MMMMMM*.  So good.  Worth it!  Definitely want to explore further."

I prefer the Boulder location as it is the original, but I&#39;m glad KND moved to Denver. 2 reasons to come: (1) tomato soup and (2) happy hour. The tomato soup is just the best, I usually pair it with the chicken sandwich. Happy hour is also awesome - you can get half off pitchers or half off the house wine, so it&#39;s about $15 for a bottle of wine. The garlic smashers are also a good option and the margaritas are surprisingly strong."

We ordered a single beer and our appetizer came out promptly - followed almost immediately by our food order. We placed the food order about 10 minutes after the appetizer and it literally showed up 5 minutes after we ordered it. 

We felt so rushed that we scarfed our food down and didn&#39;t even get a chance to finish our beer before the check came.

I had it before for few times, the chicken was one of the best roasted chicken. However, the chicken I had today for my lunch was awful. The taste was awful, the look was awful, it was dry and with no flavor. I had few bites and all my appetite was ruining.

We came here for lunch and ordered:

Organic Kale Chips $7.95
Crispy Garlic Smashers $6.95
Cuban Sandwich $9.95
Roasted Veggie Salad $9.95
Learning Garden Salad $8.95 + Chicken $3.95

The kale chips were really oily and brittle and half of them broke apart before reaching my mouth but were decent-tasting, better than the garlic smashers. The smaller potato pieces were crispy but the larger ones were much less so, more like buttery fingerling potatoes, and not all that garlicky. 

The roasted veggie salad tasted similar to a prepackaged one from Trader Joe&#39;s and I did not finish it. You can only eat so much arugula and kidney beans, which makes up most of the salad. The learning salad came topped with a ton of feta, so if you love feta that is the salad for you! I didn&#39;t try the Cuban but apparently it was fine. Not a ringing endorsement but not bad.

No real standouts when it comes to the food, which isn&#39;t a good sign for a restaurant, but it also wasn&#39;t bad enough to write home about. At least they have a selection of healthy dishes on the menu. 

Ambiance is pretty good, with an open and communal feel, but one item to gripe about were the tables. If you sit in a booth, the table is really high (or the bench too low) so you have to lean up a bit to put your arms on the table. It&#39;s a tad uncomfortable and I&#39;m hardly a shorty at 5&#39;7&#34; and, no, I don&#39;t have T-Rex arms. Petite people may prefer sitting at a high table over a booth.

Warning about the kale chips: your mouth will be RIDDLED with green flecks and some will be impossible to dislodge without some sort of flossing instrument. At least ALL of us had kale stuck in our teeth so it wasn&#39;t quite as embarrassing. If you&#39;re one a first date or something, trust me, stay away!!! 

3 stars overall, I guess..."

My daughters burger was undercooked and they took it back to cook it more... No apology, a runner brought it over when they had cooked it more and no one checked again to see if it was right.  There are many places to eat in that area and as I work nearby, those are the places I will be frequenting and recommending, not The Kitchen Next Door.

We ordered garlic smashed potatoes appetizer, a burger for my husband and soup and salad for me. First thing to our table was my arugula salad. Why this came out first, heaven knows. Salad was heap of arugula with the most unseasoned oily oil and vinegar dressing. I love arugula but this was like cow food. The dressing would benefit from some seasoning. My husband&#39;s hamburger was cooked perfectly. I also had the chicken and quinoa soup. Misnomer. Chicken and potato soup with a scant tablespoon of quinoa. Chicken had obviously been sitting in soup a long time and the nice sized nuggets were ruined from over cooking. Like dry biscuits! The broth had a good flavor but I was expecting some quinoa not a ton of sliced potatoes.

The polenta was perfect- creamy and just the right texture. The meatballs were simply delicious, flavorful and moist, topped with a tasty marinara sauce. The quantity of meatballs was a generous amount served on top of the polenta. The flavors just worked so well together!

For my food, I had the daily lunch special.  This includes your choice of three Sandwiches and a cup of the Kitchen Tomato Soup.  The soup was good, with nice flavor, and I enjoyed the sour notes.  For my sandwich, I went with the Slow Roasted Pork.  The main impressions I had of this sandwich was somewhat wet (as if it were cooked in a crock pot, and not slow roasted) and rather bland.  There was not a lot of pork flavor, nor of seasonings.  It made for a pretty boring smallish sandwich.

Lots of little things added up to a mediocre lunch. I almost didn&#39;t write a review because I don&#39;t like to write negative reviews and I really hope this place tweaks a few things because the potential is there for sure.

This place in Glendale is very quaint and has nice patio seating.  Everything looks great on the menu so I was excited to come back (was at Cuba Cuba next door a few days earlier getting some take out and grabbed a menu) Wife and I ordered the sriracha wings the ND margarita, I wanted to order a beer but they have a very limited selection with several fruity beer choices so nothing excited me. I skipped the beer but they did offer me a sample of a few which was super awesome. (I didn&#39;t ask) 

Sriracha wings were a wonderful flavor but I&#39;m not into soggy wings so they were a disappointment.  Wings should be crispy under the sauce! (Also, why was the sauce served with a ramekin smaller than the wings you&#39;re trying to dip? Weird, but no biggie just extra messy) The margarita was bitter for some reason and neither of us cared for this specialty margarita... So, Okay so onto the lunch. I ordered the Merlin&#39;s Carolina pork sandwich. I wanted to take a picture of it when it came!  --Didn&#39;t love it... but it was decent.  (My sister told me she liked it a lot so please give it a shot if it sounds good). 

Wife ordered the Koberstein Dry aged cheese burger and she very much liked it but nothing extraordinary IMO.  Once again, presentation is fantastic.

All in all, our waiter was super awesome and I&#39;m definitely going to go back and try to find something that really stands out for me since other people may just love the meals I ordered."

My Shrimp Tacos were seasoned, but rather strangely (all chili powder and cumin - no salt) - and the shrimp were so undercooked that when I reheated the leftovers the next day they were still on the raw side - not undercooked but still slimey raw...as if they had been marinated in the spicy sauce and then someone forgot to put them on the stove before plating them...I ended up tossing them out completely uneaten - as in I took a bite and had to spit it out.

The Kitchen, the full sized restaurant version of this establishment, is one of my favorite spots for a classy meal so I was very happy to see they had opened this location. They have a full menu, but the atmosphere is more relaxed and I&#39;ll often visit for a drink and a small bite. 

Community Hour is their version of happy hour and is a great deal. My tab is almost always under $30 for two stuffed bellies and two drinks apiece. They have a decent on tap selection, with a much larger bottled beer list to round out their offerings. Despite being mostly a beer drinker, I&#39;ve found their specialty beverages to be amazing and very unique; I have yet to find one where I didn&#39;t want seconds. 

As for the food, they put a strong emphasis on locally sourced ingredients, and often times they&#39;ll have the physical source of their foods listed on the menu. The bacon wrapped dates are my favorite by far: they&#39;re a balanced mix of sweet and savory, making it the perfect ending to any meal. Most recently i tried the mushroom risotto and was blown away. The base was super creamy but not so rich you couldn&#39;t finish the dish. The mushrooms and seasonal greens were plentiful, adding to the overall impressive presentation. 

Again, I could go on and on as I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here. Prices are more than reasonable. Decor is warm and inviting, with great wooden long tables as well as individual seating available. A must try for Denverites!"

Fish and Chips should be left to the professionals and not attempted by just anyone.  

I was so excited for The Kitchen Next Door to open a location in Glendale.  I love the Downtown Denver and Boulder locations and expected nothing less from this location.  My expectations were too high, way too high.

The atmosphere inside is warm with a splash of modern finishes.  As always, they seem to find some of the coolest light fixtures to add to the overall ambiance.  Service was well done and I found our server to be friendly and had fun talking with him throughout lunch.

The menu and the food is when the disappointment started for me.  The menu is small and does not have much that appeals to me.  It&#39;s casual fast food with no inspiration when it comes to the plates being offered.  I think this is the entire menu and if it&#39;s the same for dinner, that&#39;s sad.  I look forward to the fresh fish and mussels at the other locations and based on the size of this location I would have thought they would offer similar items.  

In a moment of weakness and indecisiveness I decided on the Fish and Chips for lunch.  I had food envy right away even before the food arrived.  The breading on the fish was completely soggy and not edible in the least.  The smashed potatoes were the best part and they were mediocre at best.  

Based on the menu and the execution of the food I will stick to the other locations where the menu and food is better.  The Kitchen Next Door will do fine here in Glendale.  If I was given an option I would choose Jax over The Kitchen in Glendale every time."

It also strikes me odd to have an &#34;all natural&#34; restaurant, whatever that means, turns around and deep fry things.  I&#39;ll tell you why, its because you can fry anything and it would be palatable.  My suggestion is to get some deep fried alligator here,  that&#39;s all organic and is way better than the deep fried oily stuff here.

The fish and chips are ok, but it was super oily and the tarter sauce is terrible.

The kale chips are super oily and taste like bad breathe.

The meat balls are ok.

I am so coming back here for happy hour, especially since it&#39;s so close to home. 

They just opened Wednesday and they sure hired the right people. I mentioned to the server that the mobile page said they weren&#39;t open and the manager came to talk to me about it. At least from the bartender working today, he seems to judge well - when you need attention and when you want to be left alone. 

AND my meal was fantastic.  The weekend special - a meatball hoagie. I actually ate the meatballs and the half bun with cheese and spices separately because each were so delicious. 

I put specials in my tip but left one out: there are also 1/2 priced pitchers and bottles from 9pm to close daily except for Sundays when they&#39;re 6 to close.

The Bangers and Mash are outstanding, the Garvey is sweet and the mash potatoes are freshly made.  The sausage bangers have a sweet flavor that is unlike anything I&#39;ve had before

I never experienced a bad dining experience in the Denver area. That is until I visited The Kitchen Next Door in Glendale, CO, a known hipster joint. Despite using fresh ingredients, the food was nothing to write home about. I ordered almost every dish on the happy hour menu and the only decent food item was the baked kale chips. The service was horrible. Our waitress did not seem coherent and appeared to be high. She brought the wrong order of drinks, did not check our table once the food was delivered, and departed her shift without closing the bill for our table resulting in a long departure wait. One of the waiters did try to make amends and was apologetic. This place has potential because of its location and modern interior decor. I would not revisit The Kitchen Next Door because of the poor service, questionable drug-free workplace policy, the menu needs to be re-examined, and there are so many dining options in the Denver area."

The restaurant is beautiful and there are two large community tables as well as plenty of high-tops if you are just doing the drinks/apps thing - which is what we did and the Garlic Mashers and Calamari were delicious!!!! A couple of us also chose to have dinner - the Marinated Chicken Sandwich which was very good but I was NOT a fan of their slaw. I&#39;m not sure how it is made but I took one bite and was good. No one was really a fan at our table - so if you like traditional mayo-based or KFC-style slaw, do not get this and opt for another one of their sides.

The Community Hour offers quite a few of their sides as well as some sliders on the menu, $5 glasses of Syrah and Chard (the Chard is NOT oaky and was very good) as well as a couple beer options of course. They also do 1/2 price pitchers and 1/2 price bottles of wine from 9-close Mon-Fri and again on Sunday but I can&#39;t remember what it starts then.

Atmosphere is modern and uses the space really well. The upstairs patio isn&#39;t open yet, but if it&#39;s as well done as the Jax patio 2 doors down, it will be awesome.  The wing appetizers were really good, but the sauce is especially sticky, sending us to the restrooms to wash our hands (hint: Next Door - consider some wetnaps with the wings!)

The entrees were stellar.  My hangar steak (I posted a pic of it) was excellent. I substituted beans in place of the smashers (litle potatoes that were, well, smashed!) as we had those as appetizers as well.  $17 for this entree?  Score!

The staff was attentive and friendly. Julius was an awesome server and the Manager was running food who was also very attentive. The ambiance of the restaurant and the outdoor patio were also nice. You could easily hear those at your table and the layout was nice a spacious.

Now for the interesting, odd and unpleasant;

We showed up at 4pm for happy hour and ordered two Moscow Mules and two different glasses of wine. For food we shared the Kale chips and each had the 1/2 Roasted chicken, a pork slider and the fingerling potatoes. After finishing our meals I started to get a headache and the chills. At this point we asked for and paid the tab.

Upon getting home my friend and I started experiencing the same symptoms of nausea, fever, and an upset stomach. I called to let the Manager (same guy who was running the food) know who was appreciative and apologized. He said he would check with the bar and kitchen based on the items we shared. 

Honestly, I think the Manager should have offered to refund at minimum the food. I would have been happy to let them keep Julius&#39; tip given he provided great service. 

Anyway, my only advice if you choose to go there, avoid the kale and Moscow Mule&#39;s as they ruined what otherwise would have been a good dining experience."

We were warmly greeted and seated, being a big party, at one of the two 12-person hightops.  These tables are perfect for large groups, or for meeting strangers seated next to you.

Based on Yelp reviews, we tried the bacon-wrapped dates and olive-oil-drizzled baked kale as apps.  Note that there are only 3 dates per order, so being a table of 12 we needed 12.  Probably better than we didn&#39;t all have multiple dates :)  The kale was good but loaded with sodium.

I had the salmon salad, which was unique because the salmon was served like tuna fish (broken up in a mayonaise) over greens with lots of red and white beans.   I can&#39;t say I would order it again, but it was good.  Others in our party had the bangers and mash - I would have asked how they enjoyed it but they were asleep through the afternoon meeting we had afterwards.

The Kitchen Next Door can be hit or miss. They do a few things very well, which keeps us going back. Our favorites:

- Grilled Lamb Kofta salad: Superbly spiced. Usually lamb tastes very &#34;gamey&#34; but they do something to it here that makes it taste incredible. Best lamb I&#39;ve had outside of the Middle East. Ask for it cooked medium to make sure it&#39;s done all the way. 

- Chicken and Quinoa soup and Kale and sausage soup: I&#39;m a sucker for soup and they do it superbly here. Best soup I&#39;ve had in Denver (not counting pho). 

- Meatballs with polenta: Oh so good. I don&#39;t usually like polenta but they do something to it here (maybe some cheese?) that makes it taste so good. High quality meatballs too. 

Easy parking, reservations usually not needed. Great for lunch. Service can be dicey but it&#39;s good if you know what you want."

Goatee hipster douche who did not buss our table.  We were on the end of the community table with another couple and our daughter and I expect an apology not from the manager but from the punk. 

Otherwise my advice is to stay away from this place until management can get their people to serve with basic respect.  Just spoke with my neighbors about this same snarky waiter they had the same experience."

The chicken tasted like nothing and the Cuban came with such little meat that all I could really taste was the pickles added to it. The portions are so small for the price that I feel it isn&#39;t worth it.

We were in a hurry in the middle of an afternoon when few people were in the place. So we ordered the so-called Koberstein Ranch Dry Aged Cheese Burger. We ordered it &#39;medium&#39;, which I would expect to be pink in the middle. What came out were two burgers charred black. The middle of this thing was like tasteless gray cardboard. The buns were apparently grilled and they were charred too. These were easily the worst hamburgers we&#39;ve ever paid ten bucks for. Truly, Burger King knows more about burgers than whoever cooked these things. 

We were comped on our inedible food, but that&#39;s really not the issue. The parent restaurant, The Kitchen in Boulder had a national reputation for serving wonderfully prepared locally sourced food. It&#39;s a reputation you&#39;d think they&#39;d carry into any other restaurant that claims that same vaunted brand.

When we arrived our waitress pointed to our table and said have a seat. Our table was wobbly and in need of repair. We ordered a Moscow Mule ( served in a glass not a copper cup) we ordered calamari and fried kale.
Both dishes were disappointing.  The calamari lacked flavor and was rubbery. The fried Kale was extremely salty and saturated in oil. We asked the waitress if we could order more food and she told us to wait a minute in a very rude way. We ordered fish and chips which were greasy and tasted bad.

They also have daily specials. All of which are killer but the lobster roll is the best I&#39;ve ever had anywhere. It&#39;s all lobster!!! 
But the best part if the place is the roof top garden! It is so nice to have a drink on the  roof and enjoy the view of Denver next to the most beautiful plants; flowers, herbs, and veggies. It feels like you&#39;re in your own private garden. I wish this was my house!!"

My soup came right away, and then the sandwiches a minute later. I barely even tried the soup. It seemed odd to both my husband and myself. How could our food be prepared that fast? Was it fresh? Was it just sitting in the kitchen waiting? It just seemed odd for a place &#34;known for farm to table&#34; 

And this happened. I ordered the wild sockeye salad sandwich, but it came as a salad, the salmon was served on an arugula bed with beans. Apparently there is a salad and a sandwich on the menu. I didn&#39;t even know. I did return it for what I wanted. The sandwich was good. The salmon salad is much like a tuna salad on a toasted bun. The bun was fantastic, I enjoyed the sandwich. I recommend being more clear on the menu. I&#39;m sure this has happened more than once. The sausage and kale soup was really good. It had great flavor. I&#39;m glad I ordered it.  

My husbands chicken sandwich was sub-par. The piece of marinated chicken breast had gristle and was mostly not edible. 

I was not impressed by our experience. But being that this is in the neighborhood, they are opening a huge deck, and they serve great beer, we both agree to try again. I hope the next time is better! I&#39;m  hoping that some of these issues were due to this being fairly new. The speed the food came out, I don&#39;t know how that can be explained however."

We came in for dinner because I wanted oysters and were presently surprised.  We were seated right away,  served drinks almost immediately and my oyster releanos came out within 6 minutes.  The house salsa is spicier then most Mexican places and they also have a seafood salsa that was mild and delicious. 

The oysters were also very good.  They were fresh and the ceviche was delicious.  For our main course we tried the seafood fajitas which came with a whole rack of crab leg,  a full filet of fish,  scallops,  jumbo shrimp and octopus.  All perfectly cooked.

I ordered a margarita with salt around  the edge of the glass and the friend I was with ordered a Bloody Mary,   Both drinks were served with salt around the brim of the glass and my friend said her drink tasted as if the bartender had poured a bottle of hot sauce into it.   Needles to say she had to send her drink back.  I also requested a glass of water and needed to ask for the water three times,
Then it was time for the food.   My friend ordered a simple dinner so she was safe.  I made the mistake of ordering fajitas.  I was first brought out the plate with the fillings (sour cream,  lettuce, etc).   After waiting five minutes and my friend hunting down the waitress I was brought the meat and then five minutes after That the tortillas.   Not an easy way to eat fajitas.

Unfortunately, chips and dip were the highlight of my dining experience here tonight. The flavors of the beef tacos I got were lacking. Only onions and cilantro as toppings. The food could have used a lot more seasoning. Corn tortillas were very fresh though. Some of the best tortillas I&#39;ve ever had.

My friends and I decided to come here for dinner for a change of pace for authentic Mexican food, but that was the wrong choice for many reasons. To start off two of our friends were already there and had finished the chips and salsa. When my friend and I arrived they never wanted to bring us more chips and salsa. We had to ask a numerous amount of times just for stale chips and boring salsa. They also brought out a &#34;fishey tasting coleslaw salsa&#34; that was really unappetizing. 

On to the dinner portion, I got the three cheese enchilada plate and my food was cold. The cheese was not even melted. I also ordered a side of guacamole and never got it. After flagging down the waiter for a good five minutes, he brought me out fake guacamole. Like seriously &#34;authentic Mexican&#34; the guacomole is better from the grocery store. I barely ate any of it, very unappetizing and just not worth the price. 

On to the checks, the server put the gratuity on one check even though he gave us all individual checks like we had asked. My friend asked him about it and he made it a big ordeal it didn&#39;t need to be. Then he finally gave up on the argument and just split the gratuity to everyones check. 

Overall far below average experience. If you want good Mexican don&#39;t come here, anywhere that passes off stale chips, fake guacamole, fishy salsa, and cold food should not be a restaurant in business. Not to mention the service is just as bad as the food."

It had a generous helping of carnitas, avocado, onion, cheese, mayonnaise, lettuce and tomatoes. The tomatoes were underripe, which is why 4 stars and not 5.

The front of the house is messed up, the back is messed up. Let me explain; I had to make lunch for myself on Mother&#39;s day because we made the mistake of going to this restaurant along with every other idiot in the area for lunch. We got there at 12:30 for lunch, we left at 3:00 PM. The first problem was that we had 5 people, instead of 4 like we had originally thought and because of this the stupid girls at the front didn&#39;t know what to do. It took them a half an hour before they finally resolved to offer us a 4 person booth with a chair at the end.

We took it, because by 1:15 we were tired of waiting to be seated. So, we all squeezed into a booth and put in our order - the waitress gave us a good 20 min to decide what we wanted. Good thing we didn&#39;t need a drink or anything...

2:20 rolls around, we still don&#39;t have our food. Everyone at the table talks about getting up and leaving. My husband had to leave for work by 2:30. 2:25 comes, and I get up from the table and go to the front to ask how many more tables that came in after us we are going to have to watch eat before we get our food. My bad - the food finally arrives at 2:30, well, all of the entrees except for mine which was the day&#39;s special. 

Now I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;ve never worked in a restaurant... but I&#39;m pretty certain that specials of the day are usually prepped in advance so they should take the least amount of time to get together. Especially since it was steak and lobster (neither of these items should be cooked for very long). When I got my entree, 10 minutes after my husband had already left it is so overcooked the steak is basically beef jerky and the lobster would probably bounce had I dropped it. 

Now, I&#39;m all about making allowances for places when I know they are busy. But, we had several larger booths open up while we were waiting in the same area we were sat and we had to ask to move 3 times before we were allowed to by the staff. The first two times we were told that they wanted to save the booths for parties bigger than ours - because we weren&#39;t 6 we were 5. The real bur in my ass was watching those other booths we had asked to move to get their order in, get their food and actually leave before we even got another refill.

Compounding all the frustration of being in a place that was overly packed - the waitress didn&#39;t bring us a high chair for our child so I had to go hunt one down. Nor did she come by and ask if she could get us anything while we waited so I had a impatient, hungry 1 year old to deal with this entire time. I think it&#39;s safe to say that we will NEVER eat at this location again. It&#39;s too bad, but I just can&#39;t deal with no food and shitty service. This is where I draw the line..."

The sauce over the chimichanga, I think it was a guacamole crema, was very flavorful and the right amount of spiciness. The overall vibe of the place made us a little uncomfortable, though. The service felt like an afterthought. We had to remind twice to bring water (and, unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t order any margaritas so this meant there was nothing to drink). They had on ESPN, and when my husband asked if they could turn on any of the football games, they acted insulted and never responded yes or no, and, no, they never changed the channel. I may go back to sit on the patio, but I am not sure I&#39;d want to sit inside again."

Great chicken mole. Good price.
But one of the worst margaritas ever. I can&#39;t stand when they give you a Marg list without any prices added. Well now I know why... It&#39;s because they super over-charge for them. Terrible house Marg, low end tequila, too much sour mix, and almost $9 a pop! Special margs much better flavor, but you pay for it. Still not great IMO.

I do enjoy the salsa and bean dip that comes with the chips... and nothing we ordered was terrible.. but I loveeeee Mexican food and I want to fully enjoy it.. 

I&#39;ve tried the steak burrito, chicken burrito, and steak fajitas here. All were pretty average... portion sizes are pretty good... the price is definitely lower than most Mexican places...

We were so disappointed! We like medium spicy and I would classify their food as medium hot to hot, enough that I couldn&#39;t enjoy their flavors. From the salsa that contained chunks of hot peppers, to their sauces, it was more than I could continue to eat. I can&#39;t think of any other Mexican restaurant that put us off as much as this did, and we&#39;ve enjoyed many a Mexican spot. As with salt (you can put more on your food but not take it out) too much heat is plain lousy cooking. Pass."

I got the build your own combo with 2 chicken enchiladas and a ground beef taco. Brian went with the burrito de chili relleno and added chicharrons to it.  The burrito was HUGE!! The food was amazing. The recommendations were spot on. I love their food and the server was awesome and very attentive.  The margaritas were strong, and had great flavor, little heart burn.

My boyfriend and I come here quite frequently on Sunday&#39;s, and we were told not to come because my mom had found something that looked like a heart arterie in her chicken! We didn&#39;t listen of course and when we went last night we ordered the nachos supreme, the ground beef WAS NOT COOKED! I was eating and felt something chewy and weird in my mouth and I pulled it out and it was uncooked ground beef. I got so freaked out I looked at my plate and the ENTIRE PLATE had uncooked ground beef. It was hard to tell because it was mixed in with the beans but we kept picking it out and putting it on a napkin. When my boyfriend mentioned it to the manager because I wanted to let them know it could get people sick, the manager denied it was uncooked and told us the meat is cooked for 4 hours! There is no way that meat was cooked for 4 hours! When my boyfriend than picked up the meat to show him and my boyfriend said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry but look at this it&#39;s not cooked.&#34; the manager replied, &#34;oh you mean the bristle?&#34; It was most definitely not bristle and if it was bristle this still would be a complaint because it was the entire plate! My boyfriend tried to show him the picture we took and try manager didn&#39;t look at it and just said, &#34;don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll take it off the bill!&#34; The fact that he didn&#39;t care was worrisome and after this we waited for a good 15 minutes because even though we no longer had a bill we still wanted to tip the waiter because it&#39;s not his fault. The waiter completely ignored us. Wouldn&#39;t look in our direction, nothing. And the manager and waiter walked by us a few times after this and looked up and in the other direction to ignore us so we walked out. And when we were getting to the car, the manager was out back taking the trash out WITH our waiter. They completely left us in the dust. When the manager saw us he said, &#34;aw you guys are in love that&#39;s good, did they take care of you?&#34; As if he cared and we just said, &#34;yep&#34; and left. Really how is the waiter supposed to take care of us if he is out taking the trash out and ignoring us. This place I will never go back to. Not only do the serve food that is sketch, they are very rude."

First, the free chips and bean dip is freaking delicious. That there is a good reason to come. The salsa is pretty tasty too, and so was the rest of the food. I had the steak chili rellenos (a rare sight in CO), which comes with two huge fried chili rellenos that were stuffed full. The steak was pretty solid, while the chilies tender and fried perfectly. The kicker were the sides. Too many places in Denver have very bland beans and rice, but this place&#39;s are full of flavor - probably the best re-fried beans and Mexican rice I&#39;ve had in Denver.

Service was fast and efficient, and portions are massive - well worth the price. We did have a mix-up with an order, but the waiter took care of it quickly. I&#39;ll certainly be back, but hopefully not on a day where I have to go to work afterwards...I really could have used a siesta after all of that food."

Everything was rushed and our waitress was MIA. I don&#39;t get it. If you had to stay, wouldn&#39;t you want to make it worth your while and get a good tip or a return customer.....good word of mouth?? 
Oh and their red sauce was inedible. My husband loves his spice and he was sweating and crying. That&#39;s too much. Let your customers add heat if they wish. No one wants a burnt trachea. 
Just soooo rude. They should have just sent us home. It was an awful waste of over $50 for the two of us. 
The waitress is lucky we both have worked customer service and still left her a good tip, most wouldn&#39;t have. I mean my husband even had to get our silverware from another table cuz we couldn&#39;t find a soul to help. Bad.

Real de Minas is just what 3 stars means--&#34;A-OK.&#34;  It&#39;s not awful, but not fantastic either.  It hits the spot when you need quick, fast Mexican food.  I would suggest the burritos as that seems to be the most consistent for me.  I wish they had their bean and cheese dip more often because that is fantastic--but the regular bean dip works as well.

Service is all over the place.  Some visits it&#39;s great, other times you get more interaction with the lady who brings you chips and salsa and takes your drink order.

Value leaves a bit to be desired.  We pay $3 more at Hacienda Colorado for the same meal, and I find the quality of food a bit better.  But again, it&#39;s fast, it hits the spot--it is &#34;A-OK.&#34;

Food, my opinion of Mexican food should be cheap and cheerful. Well this is not cheap. It is more on the mid to high range. The kids meals are tiny and really too small for my kids. Our meals were ok, but nothing to write home about.

I wanted to go back there and have a Michelada someday.  Now I think it will be safer to wait till I go to Mexico again.

When we asked our server about the weak margaritas, he just said that the alcohol was pre measured... Ok, but normally when a customer complains about something, I would expect a correction and apology. Nope, that did not happen. He actually acted like we were stupid for saying they were weak and also when asking for the jalapeño sour cream that came with our meal, he corrected us that it wasn&#39;t supposed to, but after looking at the menu on the way out, we realized that he was wrong.

The Tacos al Carbon are a GREAT option for a smaller meal or for someone watching what they eat. They are SO YUMMY and I crave them. I don&#39;t know what they do to the steak...but it is delicious. The salsa that comes with it is HOT! :)

I have ordered this dish at so many restaurants--and I am always disappointed and always craving Real De Minas. 

Also-love the chips and bean dip. Everyone I dine with is always pleased with their meal."

Atmosphere was fun (They had a Band, I don&#39;t think they do every night, but they should!), service was great. The menu also very good. It wasn&#39;t your typical Tex Mex like you find in CO, but they had many more authentic dishes. The Food itself was very good. 

My only feedback but its not enough to knock it down a start: The dink prices were a bit high. When a fajita is served the restaurant fills with smoke."

The bacon wrapped shrimp is to die for, but make sure you eat it fast, it is less amazing the cooler it gets. I guess the problem is that there is too much food, you can&#39;t get through the meal fast enough to eat everything piping hot. The ribs are amazing. I&#39;d never expected to have ribs that beat Famous Dave&#39;s at a Mexican restaurant.

I highly recommend them. I went for lunch today and am tempted to go for dinner as well. :)"

I was waiting for the other&#39;s of my party to arrive so I ordered a margarita in the bar and just as it was delivered, everyone showed up so I asked if the margarita could be transferred to the table bill.  We had an OK dinner, I ordered a fajita salad.  It was served in a nice flaky tortilla bowl, but the fajita stuff wasn&#39;t as hot as it should have been.  The portion of chicken in this dish was very small.  I like Old Sante Fe in Parker for this sort of food a lot better.

Nothing was served piping hot like it often is at Mexican restaurants.

When the bill came, I presented a Groupon to use.  They took it off and they raised the price of the margarita from $5 to $8!  When we asked why they said we should have read all of the fine print on the Groupon.  C&#39;mon, who reads all that stuff?  I guess it says no other discounts apply when using a Groupon.  Had I paid for the drink in the bar I would have gotten it for $5.  Now they wanted $8 for it.  After the manager came over and explained the rules of the groupon he eventually offered to take the $3 off but, it was like pulling teeth.  It was a $30 groupon and the bill still came to $25 so we spent a decent amount of money there and he was being a turd over taking $3 off.  This was the fault of the manager.  The waitstaff was fine.

Real De Minas got our money once, and got the $3 extra for the margarita, however it won&#39;t see any more of my money... ever!"

I ordered a skinny margarita and and I have to debate if that us what I really got.  It was in a large glass and I expected a fresh marg and this was not.

Service was good as usual, but I do have to say their portion sizes have gotten noticeably smaller and cheap meat for the same price.

We talked to the manager and he did attempt to make it right, by replacing the dish. But he followed that up with an excuse that everything is &#34;portion sized&#34; and bagged up at both locations. Obviously their &#34;bagged portions&#34; must have decreased. We said &#34;What could feed 4 now doesn&#39;t feed 2.5&#34;."

Our table was the only one occupied  inside the restaurant.   The waitress was busy cleaning and setting things up but still was very attentive to our needs.  the pico de gallo and chips came out right away.  We ordered stuffed jalapenos and the beef quesadilla.  both dish came out with generous helping of  guacamole, sour cream.  just ordering from the happy hour menu, we were quite stuffed and happy.

last time i was here was about 2 years ago, i told myself not to return to this place. I wasn&#39;t happy when the credit card was over charged by $5 by  crooked waiter helping himself to extra tip. Hope it doesn&#39;t happen this time.

The chips were rather stale, the salsa was blah.  The accompanying &#34;salsa of the day&#34; was a very fishy &#34;Krab salsa&#34;.  Despite two request for more chips and salsa, were never saw them until well after the entrees arrived.  And it was a long time until the entrees arrived.  Overall, the service was not good.

One of my dining companions had steak fajitas.  They did look and smell good.  The steak was ample and juicy and well-seasoned.  The onions and peppers were not overcooked and were visually appealing.

My other dining companion and I split the &#34;special&#34; shrimp enchilada and the pork carnitas.  Both of these dishes were very poorly executed.  The shrimp (like the Krab salsa) was fishy and rubbery.  The white sauce in the enchilada was gritty and bland.  The pork carnitas were very salty and did not have a lot of &#34;pork&#34; flavor.  Your average food truck carnitas taco would put this entree to shame.  My dining companion thought the refried beans were great, I think they were just okay.

I would give Real De Minas 1 star, except for two things.  One, the fajitas did look pretty decent.  And, two, we also ordered a small/medium bowl of pozole.  Was it the best pozole I have had?  No, but it was an acceptable pozole rojo with pork.  It had the right taste, if not an especially deep flavor.  It came with minced onions, shredded cabbage and sliced radishes on the side (acceptable sides, if not extensive).  It is nice that they have pozole on the menu every day, as not that many Mexican restaurants do."

Can&#39;t even tell his employees if they are charging or not for the fight and we had to argue with him to take off the soup.HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.Let me add this all happen before the fight even started and in front of other customers.The management needs to be professional in handling situations like this and first KNOW HOW TO MANAGE.We paid our bill but will never return due to the Manager Ociel being so rude and front of our kids.

Scanning the menu, I found a &#34;benchmark&#34; item: Camarones al Crema. This is my regular dish at another similar restaurant. So, the comparison was on! Unfortunately, their version did not include mushrooms or tomatoes, The cream sauce and shrimp were excellent, however.

When I mentioned this to our server, she checked with the kitchen, came back to apologize, and included a free dessert for our troubles. All in all, a solid, if not spectacular meal at a very affordable cost."

She gave us just the right amount of time to decide on our orders before checking on us after we received our drinks. It was a little wait for the food, but nothing un-bearable. My husband had the steak chimichanga, I had a taco/burrito combo, and our son had the kids quesadilla meal. All of our food was cooked perfectly and was very delicious! I was very surprised at how good this place was. The waitress was very attentive and gave us the perfect amount of time to eat before checking on us and taking our dessert order and giving us to-go boxes. For dessert my husband had the flan and my son and I shared an order of sopapillas, both very good. The waitress even said that the flan is homemade and not just the pre-packaged stuff. Only real issue I had was that the air in the restaurant was hard to breathe, sounds weird I know. But when I would inhale it felt as if I were breathing in dust or smoke and would need to cough. My son felt the same way. Our waitress said it was because there was a lot of spice in the air. We did notice most of the other customers and staff occasionally coughing as well. I hope it&#39;s not a normal occurrence and that maybe their kitchen ventilation was just having issues that night because I&#39;d love to eat there again.

It seems to be in an area with not much around, but I&#39;m not a local so maybe I&#39;m wrong? Cute little place with pretty decor inside. We were seated right away and given our menus.

Many things on the menu looked very appetizing. We started with the french onion soup. It was very different from other places I&#39;ve gotten it. No cheese on top and not a very strong onion taste, however it was probably the BEST french onion soup I&#39;ve ever eaten! Next for entrees we ordered the duck as well as the beef cheeks. Both were fantastic. The beef cheeks were so soft and delicious. The duck was seasoned perfectly as well.

The reason this place lost a star is because their creme brûlée dessert was not good whatsoever. It did not taste fresh and had more of a pudding texture versus being creamy. Also the waiter disappeared towards the ends and it took about twenty minutes to ask for the bill, pay, and then get the receipt. Other than that it was a fantastic experience. Highly recommend!"

My problem is that both this incarnation and La Marmotte in Telluride, which I&#39;ve also eaten at, both claim to be French and have AH classic French item on each menu. If they didn&#39;t claim to be French, I would have gone in with different expectations.
My mom and I went for brunch. 
I saw the Banh Mi (spelled wrong on the menu) listed and missed that it was a benedict, which might have worked. The thing is that the bahn mi was really influenced by french colonists, so they could have made some in house demi-baguette amazingness to bring this home. I&#39;m just speculating at this point.
My mom had the caramelized onion and goat cheese tart, which was delicious. 
The coffee was delicious. I love Lavazza.
I ordered the croque madame. The only French thing on the menu. It was going to be served on a bagel, which was lost on me and I asked for them to use regular bread. The presentation left much to be desired but it too was delicious.
Service was friendly and slow, which I attribute to maybe only two people working.
I feel like I&#39;m being hard on them but again there is a serious lack of French cuisine, STILL, in Denver, so don&#39;t say you are a French restaurant, when you&#39;re not."

Very warmly greeted by the Hostess and the room was warm, lovely and appointed with nice table linens. I am thinking &#39;I really like this place.&#39; Taking a suggestion from the Hostess who was also our server, I ordered the pork belly Bhan Mi sandwich. Who can resist the unctuous goodness of a gelatinous slow cooked pork belly? My wife ordered the traditionally prepared Eggs Benedict. 

The food is all freshly prepared which I truly appreciated and we were not put off by the long wait for our food. My wife&#39;s traditional Eggs Benedict was superb. The Hollandaise was beautifully composed.  My Bhan Mi, however; I took one bite and discovered an amazing thing! There was no pork belly in the sandwich or anywhere else on the plate. There were instead a couple of pieces of extra crispy thin cut bacon. The sandwich was not good and not what I was expecting and not as described on the menu. I pointed this out to our server and she inquired of the kitchen. She came back to tell me that the chef, who was also the owner, had run out of pork belly and decided to say nothing, thinking a diner would either not notice or not care. I explained that I have worked in fine dining restaurant kitchens and if we ran out of a dish we were polite enough to inform the staff that the dish was no longer available. I told her the least the Chef could do now was to apologize for presenting this unhappy and distasteful surprise. 

He refused to come out of the kitchen. What a coward. What a disappointment. Too bad because the side dishes were excellent. Our server was mortified and insisted on picking up the tab and bringing us a free dessert. We ordered the creme brûlée which had a crisp crust but the custard was watery and lumpy. We will not be back."

I WANT to write a better review than I can for this restaurant.  The food itself was delicious.  The service, on the other hand, left much to be desired.  It was one of those experiences where you consider just getting up and either walking to the kitchen and bar yourself for items or just leaving and hitting up a McDonald&#39;s because you&#39;re so hungry.   

We arrived on a Tuesday night at 8pm.  The restaurant was about 2/3rds full.  A large portion of the diners appeared to be senior citizens.  The hostess was nice enough, and we were seated in the darkly lit dining room  where a weird drawing of Christopher Walken on one wall for no explanation.  I felt a little like I was at a cafe in Greenwich, CT.  You know, stuffy and without much character.  

My husband ordered a not-very-good cocktail, and we quickly placed our food orders.  About 10 minutes after the order, we were informed my husband&#39;s soft shell crab order was sold out.  So, he revised his order to soup and an appetizer.  We were brought strange slices of bread and olive oil (not french at all) and then we waited...  and waited...  and waited.  We weren&#39;t informed about a delay, and our waitress didn&#39;t come check on us for a good 20 or 30 minutes.  When she finally appeared to bring something to our neighboring table, we asked about our order.  Another 10 minutes passed and my husband&#39;s soup arrived.  She didn&#39;t apologize for the delay or explain why it had taken so long.

After another 10 minutes and some more weird bread pieces, we received our entrees.  My slow-cooked salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked.  My husband also enjoyed is earth and turf.  It was now about 9:15pm.  When the waitress asked if we wanted a dessert menu, we had to decline as this had now been a way longer experience than expected.

It is a pity the poor service overshadowed the great food.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be returning again."

We had a reservation for 10 at 7:30.  Despite a call at six pm where the restaurant assured me they were ready, our table was not ready until 8:15.  Who cares: We made do with wine (great wine list $$$) and chit chat for 45 minutes to an hour at the bar. There was no space, repeat NO SPACE to congregate and our group hovered standing in the doorway, over dining tabletops for 45 minutes.  Not ideal!

Dinner:  Where is our server? I don&#39;t know.  The same wine and chit chat fueled us until we could order after being seated at least 20 minutes.  

Food:  The New Zealand Venison was spectacular!  Folks liked the Salmon and coq au vin.  My bouillabaisse smelled like urine and did not taste good at all, plus I had to empty the bread basket for all my shells and chitinous remains. Providing a refuse bowl with their bouillabaisse did not cross their minds, nor did providing a spoon.  

Wait.  Did I say urine?  really.  Why yes, I said urine.  That is not a good descriptor.

Desserts came, but not to our half of the table. Our half was not even given a dessert menu or checked in with when the rest of the table ordered.  We asked for a dessert anyway, long after the others had theirs.  It never came. The table was sitting round, waiting for checks, so we gave up on the dessert and waited too.  Finally, after our cards were gone long enough for our party to fund a new fishing boat for some guy named Juan in the Caribbean, we paid the bill.($167 for 2 of us)-  THE TIP WAS ADDED- 20% for a party of ten! This was not mentioned to us, and a tip line was still present in case we didn&#39;t notice.  Sorta poor form.

This was not a good experience.

Good wine list. Some good dishes....

To recap: URINE. No deserts, 20% gratuity added for lousy ass service.  Hmm.  Me thinks not so much.

Positives:

- Some of the dishes were stellar.  My goat cheese tart and his creamy French onion soup were sublime - I&#39;d come back for either but they were both very rich and perhaps the portions were too large for starters.  Also - all of the starters were in double digits - even a basic salad was over $10.  Might want to scale back on portions a bit so people have room for dinner.

- Our waiter was very nice and gracious when I sent back a really horrible cocktail - smokey Mule of some sort - ick.  He also brought tiny tastings of the wines we ordered to make sure we were OK with them.  Pours were generous after that.  I think this might be our waiter&#39;s first fine dining gig - wanted us to order our dinners before cocktails arrived - um - could we have a moment with our drinks and the menu please?

- Honestly, the food, though very French and way too rich for most of the Wash Park runners, was darned good overall.  The panko crusted salmon for me and the duck for him both were well executed but had some issues - more to follow.  Overall though you can tell there is real talent in the kitchen.

Negatives:

- This is a French restaurant and you serve the baguette (steamed - wrong) and with an olive oil accompaniment - where&#39;s the butter and the crisp baguette?  FAIL.  I get not having the time/space to bake your bread in-house but there are so many great artisanal bakeries in town now - need to step it up.

- The location is horrible - parking is bad and my view all evening was of the gas station across the street.  Not in any way a positive, especially at these prices.

- The owners (especially the woman) were not welcoming in any way.  She appeared more outgoing to the blue haired straight folks who dominated the crowd tonight but not by much.  They really need someone with a personality at the front door.

- Downside on the food.  His duck had some sort of watermelon sauce and it was really over the top too sweet.  I loved my salmon but it was perched on top of the most under seasoned tasteless lentils known to man.
  
- The zucchini garnish on both entrées was very bland and uninteresting.

It is very expensive for the neighborhood.  You could easily blow through $100 a head if you ordered a bottle of wine and dessert - we netted out at $145 with just two courses and a couple of glasses of wine.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s not a good value at the moment but they are still getting their feet wet.

I really want to hire the chef, fire his wife and move him to a much better location.  But, then, what do I know?  I do know that I&#39;m not in a huge rush to return."

My family and I were highly disappointed with this $30 per person wine tasting educational presentation since they were skimpy on the wine and small bites. There are many wine tastings for $20 per person that are much more generous with the portions of food and wine.  It was ridiculous how skimpy these portions were...for that, this place deserves a 2 star review."

I think there&#39;s a real shortage of quality French food in Denver so I was very hopeful that this would turn out to be a satisfying experience. What&#39;s being done at this restaurant is exactly what&#39;s advertised: approachable, but excellent, food.

I generally like to enjoy multiple courses and started with a round of oysters, followed by deviled eggs topped with steak tartare, pork belly, and prosciutto. The steak tartare was phenomenal and I would love to see them serve that all on its own. I had the venison for my main dish and it was extremely well executed and presented. The potato gratin that they serve with it is really lovely and a lot of care went in to the sauce for the venison. I had the lemon tart for dessert which was also well executed - it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve tried a lemon tart in which the filling wasn&#39;t browned lightly, and I do think I prefer that execution, but that&#39;s personal preference.

Service was attentive and kind. I was really quite pleased with the entire staff. I can&#39;t speak to their wine list or cocktails as I don&#39;t drink, but I think this restaurant is doing a commendable job and I recommend them highly."

Being from Europe I was excited to enjoy French food.
While the service was good the food was another matter.
I ordered the roasted organic chicken which certainly is not a complicated dish.
Well, mine was  under cooked, tough and not very enjoyable. The mashed potatoes with grainy mustard were more mustard with  mashed potatoes. Totally overwhelmed by the mustard.
 I am not a complainer, actually this is my first restaurant review. 
What made the whole experience even worse was what came next.
My husband pointed out the mishaps to the chef in a private email. It was acknowledge that my meal was not prepared properly.
An apology was offered along with a gift certificate to welcome us back. 
Sad part is: we never got the certificate.
I guess it&#39;s not important to this place for us to visit again and give it another try.
Guess what, we won&#39;t. There are plenty of other good restaurants in the neighbor hood that I am sure would love our support."

I&#39;d heard really good things.  It&#39;s cozy inside, with a good wine list. The roasted squash soup was truly delicious yet still delicate. There were some good flavors in the &#34;Earth &amp; Sea&#34; (octopus/sweetbread/quinoa) plate and the sweetbreads themselves were cooked just right.  However, my review is &#34;meh&#34; for several reasons. First, service - while nice/pleasant, there is a lack of proficiency in attention and timing (no one ever offered me a second glass of wine and I had to flag down the host for the check) and everyone in the front of the house seems uncertain/timid about their role. Second, despite billing themselves as French, they were oddly out of a very classic caramelized onion &amp; goat cheese tart. I can only assume this means they don&#39;t make them in-house and didn&#39;t receive a delivery that day, because there&#39;s no way they could have sold out of the dish when there were only two other tables in the restaurant at 6 PM on a quiet Wednesday.  Third, every piece of octopus in the sweetbread dish was overcooked and very chewy.  I love grilled octopus, so this was the most disappointing aspect of the meal.

With so many great restaurants in Denver on my list to try, I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll be revisiting Café Marmotte anytime soon."

Went there tonight for a special date night and was embarrassed by the whole experience.
The place is very small. Maybe a dozen tables. Being that there was a host, bartender and four servers I really thought service would be better but have gotten service from IHOP.
Everyone was new and didn&#39;t seem to know anything. I picked this restaurant cause website said it offered foie gras appetizer and my date has been wanting to try it but it was nowhere on the menu and no one could tell us when it was removed. The server took over ten minutes to come take our order. We ordered the escargot and an appetizer they named earth and sea. The escargot was good but it came with an entirely over cooked triangle of puff pastry. It was so over cooked it was reduced to crumbs with little push from the fork. When it was brought to their attention all they did was offer clean plate to replace the one piled with crumbs. Then came the earth and sea appetizer that was the only reason I gave this place two stars. Truly wonderful. Sweet breads cooked perfectly and octopus so tender. Then came our meals. I had lamb loin and my date had the beef cheeks. I like my meat more rare than most but this even challenged my tastes. The risotto was creamy and tasted good but it was still crunchy inside. The sauce was sickeningly bitter and everything needed a good shake of salt which was no where on any tables. It&#39;s a good thing I wasnt too crazy about it cause the server took my plate away before I was done. I thought he was packing it to go but NOPE. $26 for food I didn&#39;t get chance to finish. My date&#39;s beef cheeks came with huge portion of corn that hide most of plate. She used her side plate to take just what she wanted and left the big plate of corn. Server came to grab the plate but not once asked how things were or why she was eating off tiny side plate. In fact no one asked how our meal was at all ever. Her meal also desperately needed salt. We couldn&#39;t get anyone&#39;s attention so she balanced her plate on top of water glass. Still took a while but finally server came over. At that point my date was too frustrated so she asked for it to be boxed to go. Again no asking how it was or how to make situation better. $120 for a terrible experience. Coulda had so much better for so much less at many many other places"

The food and signature cocktails were all delicious, however if I am going to spend this type of money on a dinner out (more than $150 for 2  people), I expect the service to be top notch.  The server was not friendly and seemed annoyed at any questions we asked about the menu.  She did not seem at all informed about the menu and was so incredibly slow to take our orders.  After removing our empty appetizer plates, she simply walked away from the table and took close to 15 minutes before returning to see if we were ready to place our order and refill the empty drinks in front of us.  There were only 2 waitresses for the entire dinning room, so maybe that was part of the problem but it really did ruin the experience."

Denver has very few restaurants that are consistently great. There is much too often too much variation. Cafe Marmotte does not know how to deliver consistent good food and service. Plus it has a need to be creative in platings that just do not work. What is with the use of bowls?

On a recent visit the hostess&#39;s attitude was &#34;I&#39;m here but I&#39;m not liking that fact.&#34; As soon as we entered her snarl and growl were presented with bare teeth. While we were there there was one server who was pleasant and positive and tried to please. Yet, the soup was served without a spoon, the salt was served in a tiny ceramic container into which the serving spoon would not fit (Why not a salt shaker?).

Why did we have to ask for the salt? Because we were curious. &#34;Maybe all this blandness can be elevated with a little NACL...&#34; The pumpkin and tomatillo soup was blended smoothly. It came to the table hot but with no flavor and no spoon. I hate slurping hot soup from a bowl. 

The goat cheese tart was served with an undercooked crust. Chewing flour required a water refill.

The scallops, pork belly, and lentils was just that. Three items placed together in a bowl, sitting there, hoping for some divine intervention, I guess, to make the three come together to form a unified dish. God did not show. The lamb shank came in a bowl, sitting atop mashed potatoes with green beans smashed into the potatoes.There was no shank. I guess the kitchen thinks removal of the meat from the shank is beyond the capabilities of the guests. I closed my eyes and took a bite of the lamb, anticipating that lovely, long-braised, rich flavor. But, alas, my taste buds were assaulted with the flavor of nothing. Boring. There was no taste bud evidence of lamb flavor, nor olfactory recognition of its aroma. Trying to extract the green beans from the mashed potatoes was a sloppy dripping exercise in futility.

The filet mignon saved the meal from being a complete flop. However, for some reason, the kitchen felt it was necessary to plop a roasted tomatoes into the mashed potatoes. It oozed juice over the potatoes and added distress to the aesthetics. 

So, we have given Cafe Marmot the test of 9-dishes in two visits. The owners are not concerned about the variation in their food and service. Try La Merise in Cherry Creek if you want some simple French food."

My wife had great salad, but a very poor Bouillabaisse (the only reason this isn&#39;t 5-stars) - I would recommend avoiding it.  Didn&#39;t seem to be fresh and they overcompensate by making the portion huge.  Desset (pot du creme) was fantastic and great way to end.

We were a party of 6, and all of us left extremely pleased.  None of us had the highly rated coq au vin, but all of us raved about our main dishes, from duck to beef cheeks, to lamb shank to hanger steak. All of the starters were amazing as well.  I even found a reasonably priced Bordeaux wine that exceeded expectations and was loved by all.  Service was very attentive, friendly and welcoming. This is a special restaurant, and probably well-suited for a romantic dinner or a great place for nearby neighbors to get together for a fun night. All of us agreed that this was one of our nicest dining experiences and we look forward to visiting again."

The 1st morning we were a bit late to the hotel free breakfast, and the potatoes there didn&#39;t cut it for the wife, so since this place was next door we headed over. It was one of the better decisions we&#39;ve made in a long time. 

The 1st morning I opted for the Aztec omelet, and a side pancake. The omelet was tasty, and was more than enough food - the pancake with just me being a pig but I wanted to taste their syrups. I had (as recommended) the buttermilk, and blackberry syrups. Both were very good, but I enjoyed the blackberry best - which for me isn&#39;t a surprise. The 2nd morning I got the steak and eggs - it was OK at best. The steak was cooked fine, but no seasoning, and I admit I&#39;m not hip on their smashed tots. I wish I had gone with something else the 2nd day.

My wife had The Kitchen Sink the first day, and she was very VERY happy! The second day she had the Breakfast Burrito - and said it was good, but wish she&#39;d gotten The Kitchen Sink again.

On day one, we got in and sat quickly, however on the second day we had to wait. We ordered a cup of coffee from the bar while we were waiting, so that make it much better. As a matter of fact, a seat pair of seats opened at the bar while we were waiting so we sat there instead of waiting for a table. It&#39;s small, but it worked.

Both days they were busy, and the service was good - it was better at the bar however. The coffee was also good, and considering the drinking we had done the 1st night, it was needed :)

We don&#39;t get to downtown all that often, but if we are in the area again and want breakfast Syrup will be high on our list of places to go."

Denver, great American city.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like it, and how much I want to go back.  Syrup is a FANTASTIC place to brunch.  Pro tip: weekend service is much better than week DAY service.  You&#39;d think it would be slower on weekdays.  But it wasn&#39;t.  Still didn&#39;t deter me, I LOVE THIS PLACE.

Hubby had this hash brown stack which had like chopped chicken and eggs in it.  It was SO GOOD.  I also tried a bacon walnut pancake thing, which was the bees knees.  WE split a carafe of mimosa.  So refreshing to have them in a pitcher as opposed to having a &#34;boozy brunch&#34; option like we do in the city, and then have them never refill our drinks.  

WE liked it so much, we went twice!"

I really enjoyed the coconut crusted french toasts and the kitchen sink. This place does their crushed tater tots well. I have never seen these elsewhere. The service was consistent with the exception of one day when I came in with a handful of coworkers. I can tell you this; we came in for breakfast at 8:00am and were promptly seated, ordered by 8:12, received our food by 8:30 and were out on the curb waiting for our uber to get to work at 9:00am by 8:45am. So I am highly recommending this place even if its a work day. Be prepared for left overs. The only time I finished was when my orders were just french toast. I think adding a dollop of whipped cream to their french toast plates would be nice too. I accidentally chowed down in butter thinking it was whipped cream so be warned haha.

One very interesting thing was the serving of the side of fruit they provide. I asked for another side of strawberries and was given ONE slice berry in the syrup container. Not exactly a side. In addition, one of the berries was going bad. I can&#39;t knock them for having an off day and customs I am not used to but I did notice. 

The place itself is inside a business center. Their restrooms are outside in the lobby of said center to make sure you get the access codes for the doors. They are right at the hostess desk. Very nice atmosphere and spacious. Good for singles and groups. 

Overall, great place to chow down! Will come again when in Denver"

The past two times I have come here, there hasn&#39;t been a wait!! I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the norm or if I have just gotten lucky. Anywho, most recent trip was this past Tuesday (wanted to get out of the office for a bit) around 11 AM. I love Eggs Benedict and they have like ten different versions! I was in eggs benny heaven! It was tough to choose but I settled on the Carolina because it sounded pretty unique. It had pulled pork with bbq sauce on top of the poached egg on top of the English muffin. It looks like most of their entrees come with mashed tots on the side, as well.  My dining companion got the California eggs benedict, which looked super fresh, and an iced vanilla latte which was amaze.

Service was a little spotty, but everyone we encountered was very pleasant. I asked for hot sauce for the tator tots and they brought four different kinds! Much appreciated. 

The restaurant was FREEZING!! I get it&#39;s 95 outside so AC is a must but it must have been set to like 65 or something! Brrrrrrrr! 

I do, overall, recommend this place if you don&#39;t feel like dealing with Snooze-like crowds which are the WORST! (Especially if you had too much fun the night before and need some hair of the dog Lol)."

A bit hard to find due to the placement on the Yelp map. But I called the restaurant and they helped direct me. Super helpful. Pretty big menu. And diverse. So it made me hard to decide what to get. I wanted eggs, but I also really wanted the sweet and savory pancakes. I wanted to go for the eggs your way with the S&amp;S pancakes. But that is not one of the allowable pancakes with that meal. *womp womp* I could have gotten the bananas foster though. I ended up with the S&amp;S pancakes and an egg as a side. I was not impressed by the pancakes. We have something very similar in Atlanta and it is much better. I also didn&#39;t really like the vanilla cinnamon syrup. I should have just went with plain maple. My fault. It sounded so good though! Oh well. Experiment concluded."

The app they used for waiting in line helps a little bit.  It is nice to see how many groups are ahead of you without bothering the hostess.

There is a large seated waiting area outside in the little strip mall that helps with any line waiting."

I love the idea of having a little breakfast bar where you can get drinks while you wait or food to go. We were seated quickly despite it being ideal Saturday brunch time. I ordered a hazelnut morning which was delicious and had great flavor, but was actually just lukewarm. Would have really preferred the drink to be hotter. For food, I got the kitchen sink which was absolutely delicious! I&#39;m always torn when ordering: side of bacon or sausage? Biscuits and gravy or eggs with hash browns/tots? This dish took care of these issues and the indecisiveness I usually face. The service was also great and our waiter didn&#39;t rush us at all. 

Also, the shirts are one of the dopest designs I&#39;ve seen. The Colorado flag with breakfast food? Easy 10/10"

Parking is not easy unless you wanna pay in a garage. is this little complex supposed to be a destination? I was confused it looked like a first floor Mini Mall with office suites upstairs. 
Bar up front is tiny like a wait are for 4-5 so eaters  seems outa place.

The food... I ordered the Maryland Benedict. I thought I was eating hash brown potatoes on an English muffin. The latte was so sugary sweet, I added a full cup of black coffee to make it drinkable.   

However the wait staff is awesome. My waiter accommodated every request and was prompt courteous, yet cool and hip at same time. Gave him a generous tip for being on point. 

Loved the decor combo of Martha Stewart meets M hotel restaurant.

The service was good and friendly, but I felt like our food came out almost too fast.  We were still enjoying our appetizer of pigs in a blanket (which was delicious and super filling) and a few minutes later, our entrees came out.  Everything was delicious, but I probably would have been full on just the app, and my Real Dill Bloody Mary!

The other thing I thought was odd, was for a place called Syrup, the staff did not once mention or try to promote their multiple flavors of syrups.  I asked for the butterscotch and the Kahlua flavors with the pigs in a blanket (both were delicious) but I found it weird they didn&#39;t offer them, or ask if we wanted other flavors.

I thought this place had a great menu, and a unique, contemporary meets country store vibe in the middle of downtown. We will be back (when we&#39;re not fighting heat stroke), and I&#39;m already planning to bring our out of town family here  when they visit!"

Syrup was located a stones throw away from the hotel I was staying at in downtown so we decided to check it out. The wait wasn&#39;t too bad for the Sunday breakfast rush. It took about 10 minutes for a table of two. The restaurant itself was very clean and has that trendy casual vibe that Jelly or Snooze has. 

I was a little disappointed with what I decided to order after I kept seeing everyone eating either french toast or pancakes and they looked amazing. Next time I will definitely order some french toast to make up for. I went with the Cherry Creeker. It was a plate of eggs benedict and corn beef hash. I did however make an excellent choice order a side of crack bacon. I need more of that bacon in my life.

The portions are large and almost as unhealthy as they come, knowing that that&#39;s what most of us go out to eat for breakfast! Their pancakes and waffles are large and well done.

When I say right next to them we were literally sitting inches apart on the bench in the back of the restaurant. With an almost empty restaurant they could have sat us anywhere else.

Other than that, this was a great meal. The restaurant is decorated nicely in greys and whites with tables and bench style tables throughout the restaurant. The service was great as our waitress was training someone so we got two for one.

We started with the cracked bacon. I did not like it at all. I hated the combination of the sweet with the sea salt and pepper, but my husband cleaned the plate and would have eaten more. The lovely gentlemen eating next to us raved about it as well. I just could not get past the syrupy sweet yet overly salty taste.

I had the breakfast burrito sans meat and a side of the smashed tots. I liked the flavor on the green chili, but it was nothing special. I&#39;ve had much better. The smashed tots were pretty addictive. I am not sure what the spice on them is, but they are addictive. I liked the change from just plain old hash browns.

Normally our breakfast stop is Snooze, but we wanted to try something different. While the food was good here, I think we will stick with Snooze next time."

Nothing on the menu really stands out as amazing, but it is a good, solid choice if you&#39;re in the mood for breakfast.

My first visit, I got the pancake flight with different syrups, and chose the maple vanilla and coconut syrups. The maple vanilla was really good, with flecks of vanilla bean and a really delicious flavor. The coconut syrup was cold and pretty &#39;meh&#39;. E got the sriracha chicken waffle sliders, which he said were pretty good. But you&#39;ll have to take his word as I never got to try any!

The second visit I got eggs with their signature smashed taters (a sub for traditional home fries or hash browns) and a fruit cup. Oh man, those smashed tater tots were SO good! Next time, I&#39;m getting just a plate of those. I wish they sold them loaded with different ingredients because I would be ordering those every week!

Like I said above, this place is a decent breakfast spot if you&#39;re in the area, but definitely don&#39;t go out of your way for it.

The waffles were good and warm but very dense. I know it&#39;s gluten free so that&#39;s why but it was overall okay. I tried the strawberry syrup and the vanilla maple since they were out of the coconut. Both were good , I prefer the vanilla maple. They have around 6 syrup flavors and lots of butter too.

It was one of the best breakfasts I had at a restaurant in a while. It  all was very rich, however.  I don&#39;t know what kind of bread they used, but I&#39;m guessing it had a lot of butter and eggs before they started to make French toast with it.   

So, be warned that it might not be the healthiest meal, but it was delicious and I would get it again."

We all agreed on brunch at Syrup downtown Denver.  I have been to the one in Cherry Creek and love it! They won&#39;t seat you if your whole party hasn&#39;t arrived.  I kind of understand this, but at the same time, we were all ready to start drinking.  Just because one person is running behind, you shouldn&#39;t hold up the rest of the party. We were finally seated and the drinking commenced. I knew exactly what I wanted when I walked in the door and was ready to gobble the food up. I ordered the silver dollar pancakes with peanut butter whipped butter and butterscotch syrup. This was a sweet tasty way to start the day off. Topped with a carafe of mimosas, my morning was complete and I was ready for the Rockies game. The service was awesome and the food was delicious!"

Was seated quickly on a Friday morning and ordered the Jan omelet and a pancake on the side.  Asked for fruit as an option.  Omelet came out and was underwhelming, pancake was lukewarm, and fruit was soiled.  Also added hash browns which I did not ask for.  The food server offered to replace the fruit after seeing it&#39;s condition and I obliged.  When the hostess/server woman came out with it to trade out she oddly looked at me.  I told her the other guy suggested I switch out the fruit and she just turned and walked away.  Odd.  This experience ended with the table next to me receiving my bill.  Definitely not the 4 star Yelp experience I was anticipating."

Syrup is a place that specializes in breakfast. They have assorted syrup&#39;s, who had done this since...hmm.. ihop? I dont know maybe you can tell me.

They had a wide array of breakfast cocktails. The place is really clean with light interior and plating. The bar is towards the front of the establishment. The waiters didn&#39;t have uniforms on so it was a little confusing trying to distinguish who was who for a minute. 

The food took a little long to come out seeing that it was a Friday morning and many people werent dining at the time. We settled on french toast, some weird potato chip fries and pancakes. The food came out the french toast was fine but my pancake was not hot, this I didnt like. It was heavy and dense and it had a weird taste. I thought maybe because it wasnt hot. So i asked for another pancake yes 1 pancake thats all that I ordered. 

After a time I thought was very inappropriate for a person to wait for 1 single pancake, I finally got the pancake. I can tell you that it still wasnt hot. It was warm at best this time. I didnt like it. The batter was more like cake and they added nutmeg. Sorry folks, no buttermilk, no fluffiness and not vanilla flavored goodness. The fries werent good either. They were shaped and sized like potato chips with the inside like a french fry. They werent working for me.... yea.. its a no for me dawg (Randy voice).

Would I go back? I cant say yes or no for sure. Maybe I would on the stregth that this is the concept of a Milwaukee native. I have to show love. The food needs to step up."

That&#39;s about the best thing I can say about it, however.  Service was abrupt and bordering on rude.  I ordered the Brooklyn omelette.  It was dry and in serious need of seasoning.  Hot sauce was helpful (something I normally never use). The tater tott mash sounded like a good idea but the only flavor it had was that of rancid oil.  Maybe stick with items that have lots of syrup on them at this place.  I won&#39;t be back, however."

The flight of pancakes? Sounds great but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s three or was it four pieces of pancakes that just sat there. Boring as boring can get. I already forgot the rest of my experience.

Well what about the simple eggs and bacon? Yes. This is ok. Like I said very pedestrian. The side of corn beef hash was the small twinkle in my eye that morning.

Yah the wait was an hour, but whateves....I equate a long line to mean that there&#39;s good food to be had so I don&#39;t mind waiting. I choose Syrup because they offered a different type of brunch menu then I was used to. I dig how the menu is set up. Menu tabs make it easy to navigate plus the FAQs sections is very helpful (hint: Wifi password is here)

What my group of 4 ordered:
-3 orders of what they call &#34;pigs in a blanket.&#34; First off, these should NOT be called pigs in a blanket because I assumed it was going to be a sausage link rolled in a pancake bun. They should be called &#34;pancake sausage sandwich&#34; because they are literally a round sausage patty inside a small pancake. Regardless of the ill fitted name, they are DELICIOUS! 

- 2 orders of Cracked Bacon- ridiculously good bacon. Order it!!

- Pancake flight with butterscotch and coconut syrup.....my friend really enjoyed it. 

-side of corn beef. Tasty but not as tender as I was hoping since this is what they are known for. 
 
- Bowl of green chili. Again, good but not great. I have def had waaay better so I was disappointed since this also was the dish that put them on the map. 

- Maryland Benedict (my dish)- hands down one of the best crab cakes Benedict I have ever had......and that is my go to brunch dish!!! The crust on the crab cake was so flavorful, light and crunchy. They were so good that after letting my friends try a bite, they almost ordered extra crab cakes! And Even though they didn&#39;t put my hollandaise sauce on the side as I requested....I didn&#39;t mind once I tasted it because it wasn&#39;t over powering and they didn&#39;t drown my dish in it like everywhere else does. Very good mild flavor. 

Mile High tower- my friend really enjoyed his huge egg goodness concoction topped with hollandaise sauce. 

Sweet Thai Chili Chicken waffle sliders- my friend wasn&#39;t that impressed but he said they were tasty. 

I can see why this is a popular brunch spot. Nice sleek ambiance, friendly staff, good service and super tasty food are all thumbs up in my book. Don&#39;t let the long wait deter you. When I called earlier that morning, the lady said they don&#39;t take reservations but the menu said they do take &#34;call ahead seating.&#34; I will def recommend this place to friends."

The pancake flights are more than delicious. You get to pick out different butters and syrups for the flight. Try the blackberry and buttermilk syrup mixed. You can thank me later!

The ambiance is very welcoming and bright. The bathrooms are located in the lobby area mear the entrance. You will need to ask the front desk for the code. 

The front door of the restaurant is actually located inside of the office building. This was very confusing but we found it.

I was Downtown for a week for a training. Lunch comes around and I am quite happy to find that there is a Syrup in the base of the building. Score! I have very fond memories of the Syrup in Cherry Creek so my hopes were high.

The atmosphere is trendy and, compared to the other Syrup, somewhat pretentious feeling. The wait staff was friendly although not overly attentive. It did get busier as we were there, but half way through our meal I am pretty sure our waiter magically disappeared. This was not great since we only had an hour break.

The food is definitely priced like a trendy brunch as you would expect. Most entrees are $10 to $15 and they charge liberally for any add ons or adjustments. I would be alright with all of this if the food really shined. It doesn&#39;t. As there are only a couple of vegetarian options: a couple of omelets and a benedict on the savory side of things, I decided to make my own omelet. I only had three ingredients and I quickly got to an $11 omelet. Granted, one of those ingredients was avocado. 

When my omelet came out, I was sad to see that the avocado had magically disappeared with the waiter. Eventually, I realized that the avocado was cooked into the eggs. This avocado-egg pancake type thing was then folded over the other ingredients. Strange to say the least. The unfortunate result of this was an avocado I never tasted but payed $2 for. The eggs were dry and flavorless. The potatoes were present but somewhat over cooked and also lacked flavor. Thank goodness for condiments. 

Overall, this place is not bad, but not great. I have only been the once and may have found other entrees to be more to my liking. Unfortunately, that first experience for me is a negative one and so it will be a while before I return. I just hope the Cherry Creek location has not become like this."

There was hardly any meat on the benedict and we made the mistake of ordering it on a bagel, which was way to bready for the amount of toppings on it. What got to me, was the bananas foster..

When we went, it was freezing outside, and I was surprised to find that we needed to keep our coats on inside to stay warm. The interior feels a little like a hotel breakfast space- cozy enough but not spectacularly designed or comfortable.

The menu offers lots of choices, including a selection of. . . wait for it. . . .syrups! Of those we tried, the maple and buttermilk were my favorites. The Kahlua syrup was a little too sweet. I ordered the crunchy french toast, which was the perfect combination of crispy on the outside (granola coating, perfectly crusting the bread) and soft and moist on the inside. That&#39;s no accident -- someone had to learn how to prepare that just so! My friend had the kitchen sink biscuit, which was very dense. His maple pepper bacon, though, was just right. 

Next time I would split a meal for sure; the menu seems to offer choices between sweet and savory plates, and I kinda want both. As plates are rather big, and not a single person at my table or surrounding tables seemed close to finishing, my recommendation would be to order less rather than more, unless you want to take it home in a doggie bag for elevensies."

The portion of eggs Benedict was so small that hubs and I had 2nd breakfast within an hr. 

This place must have mostly tourists reviewing it because it&#39;s not worthy of 4-5 stars..."

The business also claimed to be the &#34;THE BEST BREAKFAST RESTAURANT IN DENVER&#34;.  We came here on a Thursday morning so it wasn&#39;t that crowded however we waited for about 10 minutes with no service. Finally I decided to notify the hostess that no one came to take our order. Sure enough they forgot about us or there was some kind of mix up though it wasn&#39;t that busy. The server finally came and took our order and we received our food. It was really disappointing. I asked for the bacon to be extra crispy but it was soggy. The food just doesn&#39;t taste fresh or hot. They are also cheap with the strawberries - ironic that the French Toast dish was called STRAWBERRY FIELDS yet there were only like 3 slices of strawberries. I asked for more strawberries and the server brought us a bowl with just 3 more strawberries lol I felt this was a waste of a good breakfast when we saw so many breakfast places while on our way to this place.

I really enjoyed the food and service at Syrup. Although the overwhelming selection on the menu was a bit much to get through it managed to balance out with a healthy and delicious breakfast. There is a large selection of dishes to choose from that range from &#34;I will eat anything&#34; to the Picky eaters. I went with a simple egg white dish and French toast and enjoyed my healthy choice.
My friend went with the chicken and waffle sandwich which looked amazing. I did sneak in a bit and was very pleased with the variety of flavors from sweet to salty.
The service is usually what will keep me coming back to a restaurant and this place did not fall short. Our waiter was very friendly and kind. 
Perfect spot to be at during a winter storm. Would definitely go back to try some more adventurous dishes."

I need to learn to make sure &#34;over medium&#34; means &#34;runny yolk.&#34;  Two days in a row I&#39;ve had this problem, but never before in other places.  That said, the vibe here is awesome, the food is really good, and the staff is super friendly.  Being the jerk I am I saw the empty tables and wondered why there was such a wait, but I was (unintentionally) put in my place when later in our visit it was mentioned that they limit seating sometimes so they can keep the quality higher.  I sure can appreciate that.  I only had the eggs and corned beef hash and they were both very tasty.  My idea of corned beef hash seems to be very different, but the flavors were totally solid.  It comes off a bit more like BBQ to me, but what a tasty &#39;que it was.  I tried a nibble of She&#39;s eggs benedict and typically all I taste in this dish is citrus.  Not here.  Fantastic.  I mentioned it before, but worth it again: the service is outstanding.  

She Said:

As I&#39;ve mentioned in previous reviews, I love to get eggs benedict when I go out for breakfast. It&#39;s an indulgent meal that I just won&#39;t bother to make for myself, but when I can have it, I love it (if it&#39;s done properly). On the trip to Syrup, I went with the California, and it was definitely done properly. After my previous morning&#39;s breakfast (see the Sam&#39;s #3 review if you&#39;re interested), I decided to be sure to ask if my English muffin would be toasted. Since I&#39;ve never made the dish, I decided that maybe I was remembering incorrectly and eggs benedict don&#39;t normally come with a toasted English muffin... the waitress looked startled by my question (though He explained why I was asking), and assured me that my English muffin would be toasted. With that, I ordered and enjoyed the second best eggs benedict I&#39;ve ever had (the first being at Ardmore Station Cafe outside of Philadelphia, PA). I also ordered bacon, and it was peppery and delicious.

We had to wait a bit for our table, but that gave us time to grab a geocache a block or so away. We usually expect to wait a while at a good breakfast joint, so that wasn&#39;t going to be a problem even if the geocache hadn&#39;t been there.

The wait staff was wonderful. I can&#39;t remember our waitresses name, but she did a great job on a busy morning, and others were quick to fill a coffee cup or bring me more tea if she was busy. The general manager of the restaurant, Gabe, came by to ask us about our meal, and we assured him that we were quite pleased. Gabe explained (unprompted) about the empty tables while people were lined up outside (something we had wondered about), and he explained the reason behind that.

Overall, I highly recommend Syrup. Expect to wait for a table, but the food is worth it. I hope we&#39;ll visit Denver again someday soon, and when we do, Syrup will be on our list for return trips, and a place we recommend to friends visiting the area.

Potty Points: Five Stars! Although an access code is required to get in, that means that the bathrooms are clean and not packed. The bathroom was so nice I visited it twice in one visit! (Though all the tea I drank may have had something to do with that too.)"

The Bad: parking
The Ugly: None

My experience having breakfast at syrup has left me very sad. I wish there was one in Reno. I surely cannot fly to Denver every week for breakfast. It was great while it lasted but its goodbye for now. 

Syrup was absolutely packed on the Saturday morning that I went. Having to wait 30 minutes for a table was exciting because that just means that there was a reason so many people wanted to eat here. That reason became apparent very quickly after being sat.

The food was super good! It was so good that I was already looking at the menu to decide what I was going to eat the next day, and the day after that. So day 1, I had the Fosters French Toast. French toast bread was from a roll instead of your everyday loaf of bread. It was covered in maple vanilla syrup and topped with banana. This was the best french toast that I have ever eaten. The syrup was the icing on the cake. You could actually see all the little seeds from the vanilla bean. Day 2, I had the breakfast burrito and a side pancake to try the Kaluha Cream Syrup. The burrito was topped with a green chili stew and it too was one of the best breakfast dishes I have ever had.  Denver people, you are truly lucky to get a breakfast place like this.

The service was excellent. Each time that we came in, the server was so helpful in recommending things to do while on vacation in the area. The servers even wrote down names and addresses of places to check out. We used many of the great suggestions, I owe a lot of credit of my great time in Denver to the employees at Syrup."

I was intrigued by buttermilk syrup which yes, ended up being creamy, tasty syrup and something that now I need to figure out how to make myself. There are berry syrups here, maple vanilla, butterscotch, and kahlua syrup!?? I need to go back to denver just to get a syrup sampler here. The ones we tried were amazing, and now I may have a fancy syrup addiction. 

It was unanimous that their &#34;crack bacon&#34; was simply amazing in every way you could think of. It was crispy, yet chewy, packed with flavor and cooked in some sugary sweetness that made this honestly some of the best bacon I have ever had. We definitely had trouble sharing this order of bacon, and we knew at that first bite of bacon that we had picked a great place for brunch. Then came their pigs in a blanket which I thought was so unique since they instead here cook the little pigs/sausages into the pancakes themselves. And these paired so well with that buttermilk syrup, I should have just ordered another round of these two items to keep us in brunch heaven. 

I got one of their benedicts (the cherry creeker) which was pretty tasty and very very filling especially after those starters with poached eggs on corned beef. There was a problem with the breakfast buritto ordered since my friend can&#39;t eat tomatoes and they brought it our with tomatoes the first time and it took a while to bring out another one...that said, they were very apologetic and then actually took that item off of our bill which was very nice of them. And the nutella stuffed french toast was also a big win. So all in all, get here early so you don&#39;t have to wait in what I hear can be hour waits, and enjoy! Yay for breakfast!"

Nice atmosphere and lots to choose from on their menu.  I went for the Crab Cake Benedict - crab cakes were great and it was served with an arugula salad which helped cut through some of the richness.  The only thing that was little off was that they used a hash brown patty in place of English muffins for the Benedict - the textures were a little off and if I came here again, I would see if they could adjust this."

Nothing like a gut buster first thing in the morning.  The thick cut bacon was awesome.  I tried the corned beef off my husband&#39;s eggs benedict, as this dish was what the menu claimed to have made Syrup popular.  Gotta say, pretty tasty.  The husband also ordered the fully loaded bloody mary...I&#39;m not a fan, so I didn&#39;t try it...but it looked over-the-top.

We were seated by the window, which was eh, because we were in full view of all passersby.  I didn&#39;t really get a glimpse of the rest of the dining area.  Service was kind of eh, too.  Waitress took a while to take our order, checked on us like a minute after we got our food, and left us alone until we flagged her down for the check.  Just come for the food, I guess."

(hello Katie!)

Its been this way for as long as I can remember. First thing in the morning, dreaming about eggs, bacon and toast. Hell, when I was the ripe age of 2, my nanny would leave a side of bacon on the counter, and each morning I&#39;d reach my little hand up, grab that bacon and gobble it up. Needless to say, I developed my love for bacon and all things breakfast at an early age. 

Fast forward 27 years and my love for bacon - and breakfast in general hasn&#39;t changed a bit. Over the weekend the Friedel side of the family was in town and naturally, brunch was in order. They chose Syrup, and a good choice it was. Syrup is one of those cozy, trendy brunch places that doesn&#39;t feel douchy despite being downtown...and the hour long wait. Here are the takeaways:

1. Make reservations. They don&#39;t take same day reso&#39;s, but call ahead seating is offered, if calling on same day as dining. This place is constantly packed so making a reservation is crucial....which we clearly didn&#39;t do. fail.

2. Try their pancake flight - with a handful of their signature syrups! we loved the glazes and the lemon syrup. mmmm! their selection of appetizers are perfect for large groups and everything was cooked to perfection! Pass on the salmon - I sampled it on a benedict and it was less than memorable. In fact, it was smashed onto my croissant and tasted a few days old.

3. Drinks are worth it. We sampled a few of their drink specials but ultimately decided the carafe of mimosas was worth it. $12, can&#39;t go wrong.

4. Service is friendly but everyone seems quite overworked. our waitress got many of our orders confused, as well as multiple people coming out to our table with plates of food, that wasn&#39;t for us. It could have been the massive wait and lack of turnover, but poor girls seemed tired!

Due to my brunch addiction, I know i&#39;ll return :)"

It can lead to awkward interactions and random hook ups, but the food is worth this particular hassle! 

Syrup has a great selection of specialty syrups (such as blackberry syrup and Kahlua cream syrup), and their basic maple vanilla syrup is incredibly tasty. Syrup&#39;s pancakes and french toast are some of the best -- maybe the best?! -- I&#39;ve ever tasted. The mimosas are basic, but you won&#39;t find me complaining about a mimosa. There&#39;s a variety of items on the menu, which can satisfy your vegetarian or mega-meat-eating friends. 

I love this place for breakfast or brunch! When I take newbies here and they ask what is good, my reply is: &#34;Everything.&#34; I can&#39;t evaluate their lunch menu, though, since I&#39;m always drawn to their tasty breakfast items.

We met a couple of friends at Syrup for a late brunch. I was soooo excited, I spent more time than I care to admit looking at pictures of the food on Yelp and drooling. The menu is extensive and impressive, so it was difficult to decide on one thing. I ended up landing on an egg white veggie omelet and a stack of buckwheat pancakes with berries and bananas, which is more or less what I usually order when I go out for brunch. 

I think we picked a good time to come, as it was just after noon and the Bronco&#39;s game was starting, so the place wasn&#39;t crazy busy. We were seated quickly and our food came out pretty fast. I was excited about my pancakes when she dropped them off because they looked so perfect and delicious. The egg white omelet came out shortly afterwards. The omelet was DRENCHED in oil. Normally when somebody orders an egg white omelet, they&#39;re trying to cut back on fat, but cooking it in an exorbitant amount of oil completely defeats that, does it not? And the oil they doused the eggs in should have gone into the pancake batter, because they tasted like dry cardboard. I make a lot of pancakes at home - multigrain, whole wheat, regular, whatever, and they are never that dry. They actually needed to be doused in syrup, which I suppose is true to the name of the restaurant, but they shouldn&#39;t need to be. They should be good on their own. 

I will say that the service was good, the waitress was on her game. Normally I would bring bad food to the attention of the server, but everybody else at the table was enjoying the meal and I didn&#39;t want to put a damper on things, so I just kept my mouth shut. Then the bill came. The upcharge for approximately 1/4 of an underripe banana was $1. The upcharge for egg whites was $2. The total for my pancakes and omelet was $25. 

NEVER. AGAIN. If I&#39;m going to pay $25 for brunch, it had better be impressive. Honestly, I like IHOP better."

Still a great brunch place nonetheless! I find this downtown location a bit better than their location in Cherry Creek imo. 

I love their selection of waffles and pancakes. I usually get the mini waffle flight so I can have a savory side of bacon with it. Mmm hits the right spot! Their different toppings and syrups (naturally) always lets me find some new combination to try!

When I want something more lunch-y, I get their Ava&#39;s Grilled chicken salad. It&#39;s very filling and I love the corn and roasted bell peppers. My boyfriend loves the Julienne sandwich as well; it&#39;s his go to here!"

We came here at 1:35PM on a weekend thinking that we still have time to sit down and have some brunch. But the lady up front told us that they were closed. We mentioned that it says on the door that the place is open till 2PM. She looked down and said with attitude &#34;well the kitchen closes at 1:45PM&#34; almost if she didn&#39;t want to sit us down even though there were plenty of table unoccupied because she had to get out of there ASAP.

I had a chai latte which I LOVED. It had lots of spice and thick foam on the top which I really liked. I typically get a chai latte everyone - so this was exceptionally good.

Boyfriend got eggs my way and waffles. The syrup list was crazy (hence the name syrup) - he chose pecan butter (my favorite), vanilla syrup, and maple syrup. He liked everything, but especially the syrup. I wasn&#39;t feeling a huge breakfast since we were going to go hike up to Red Rocks, so I got the oatmeal, fresh fruit, and french toast. French toast and fruit were average. But, it&#39;s weird, the oatmeal was freaking delicious with a creme brulee style crust on top. It was a pretty decent amount too, and I finished 75% of it and all my french toast and fruit.

Overall, it was a great find with delicious food. The trick is that Syrup is located inside of Denver Place (sort of like a mall/business building/food court area). Service was nice."

We stopped in this afternoon, close to closing, and ordered right away. First, the mimosa carafe came, my friend received a dirty glass and I took a sip to discover such an awful taste. The waiter explained it was due to the cheap champagne they use; I&#39;ve bought cheap wine before and not experienced such a terrible tasting mimosa. Secondly, our food came out and we each got an eggs Benedict dish. The eggs were overlooked and by far not close to being poached. They were light handed on the hollandaise and green chili served as well. But, the coffee was good.

Just a bland meal with no valid excuse. I won&#39;t be returning.

Technically, it&#39;s an Irish pub, but it doesn&#39;t fit the mold in a good way. First, the craft beer selection makes me giddy. Every tap counts--there is almost always a great IPA (occasionally even Stone&#39;s Enjoy By!!), a new local beer or two, and a more complex Belgian (e.g. Delerium Tremens) on draft. They also have a great bottle beer list, including delicious stouts all year long. Cocktails aren&#39;t too expensive, and there&#39;s a good whiskey selection.

The food has twists on the familiar to keep your senses interested. Really good salmon fish and chips, for example. They keep it interesting by changing the menu periodically and often have specials. The spot always has a thoughtful vegetarian main dish, and their salads are fresh and satisfying. My favorite indulgent dish is the mac and cheese (with lots of add-on options) followed by the Irish nachos. 

The servers and bartenders are friendly and attentive, and I feel relaxed when I go there. The place is good for long conversations (although sometimes the place is utterly packed) and craft beer."

The service is amazing, the happy hour is great and the food is exceptional. I really like the energy here, kind of an American/European pub. They have a variety of local brews and appear to play all of the sports you&#39;d want to see. 
The spot is small for how popular it can be, so in the cold weather it might be hard to get a seat. During warmer days, there is a patio that has half a dozen tables. 

I definitely recommend going during off hours, but any time is worth the wait. The crowd is more of a richy entitled bunch, but that&#39;s the area for you. Every time I&#39;ve gone it has been awesome."

I thought it was insane that they charge $7 for an average slice of pie (one of the reasons I gave 4 rather than 5 stars).

My hubs and I came here for date night last Friday as we were in the Wash Park area and were satisfied with our meal. We both felt that for $40 at a pub without drinks it wasn&#39;t anything super special. We both ordered the bison burger which was pretty good. It was definitely on the juicy side which is always a bonus. He ordered tater tots and I ordered sweet potato fries - both at an up charge. The sweet potato fries were good - your standard fry. I didn&#39;t have any of the tots but I think the hubs felt the same way.

The service was only so-so. It seemed like our server wanted to be anywhere but at work. I get its not fun to work on a Friday night but I don&#39;t think its fair to take it out on your tables.

All in all - I felt that we overpaid for a satisfactory meal. This is one of those places I would go if I was in the area and we were meeting other people but probably not another date night spot for us."

We normally go on Sunday&#39;s during happy hour and there is rarely a crowd. The bar is very clean and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.

Everything we&#39;ve had on the menu has been great. This is a great place for accommodating vegetarians as well!

The veggie burger and kale salad was perfect. The Finley burger and mac and cheese are a must try! 

They also have some good munchies - the Irish nachos with crispy chips and tender meat are amazing! The assortment of wings are also a good go-to!

My husband and I lived in an apartment nearby for a few years, and this became our neighborhood bar. The owner, Pete, is a friendly guy who wants you to enjoy the overall experience. Best of all, he knows his brews, and as beer lovers, we enjoy hearing what he has to say about the rotating tap. What really won me over was the rotation when he had Delirium Tremens (my personal favorite) on tap. 

They have old, vintage skis and ski posters around the joint. Plus, they have a &#34;sexy&#34; pic of George (from Seinfeld) in the ladies&#39; restroom. Ha. Gets me every time. 

The Finley burger is amazing. It&#39;s our go to...I love the bearnaise sauce drizzled on top, and the shoestring fries are always perfect. We haven&#39;t had any issues with having it served medium rare (hubs) vs. my well done, as other reviews have noted. 

Cocktails are also perfection. They have a whiskey apple something or other, a julep type drink, and one other always on their menu that won&#39;t disappoint. 

If you want a great place to hang, this is it. I&#39;ve never seen it crowded, and we can always find a spot at a booth or table. When the weather is nice, the patio is a great option. As others have mentioned, they don&#39;t have many staff. If it is busy, you&#39;re gonna wait a bit longer. I think this is because it&#39;s so often empty as opposed to crowded.

I like to drink however due to my having to wake up early most mornings and frugalness, choose to do so at home so I don&#39;t frequent my nights going to pubs. But I saw a $20 for $10 deal and thought, why not? I love me some bar food and reading the reviews, this place seemed legit. Then I saw they had a brunch menu and game was on!

They open at 10am on Sundays, we were there before 10am because we love brunch that much and sat on the patio. We were the only table there and only one server working so the dining gods were on our side. It was super quiet outside on Pearl and everything was peaceful. They have a limited brunch menu but I saw old faithful on there, Eggs Benedict, so it didn&#39;t take too long to decide what to get.  They do an Irish pub spin on the classic dish with corned beef, spicy hollandaise sauce (get it on the side and save money on angioplasty later on in life!) and sweet potato hash. 

Sigh.

Ok, so my boyfriend and I go splitsies on brunch so we can have the best of both worlds like sweet and savory dishes. His french toast looked amazing but after taking a bite of the Benedict, I didn&#39;t want to share. I begrudgingly gave him his portion wishing I could just steal it back and have it for myself but sharing is caring and he drove me there so I obliged. I don&#39;t know i it was one specific thing or all the ingredients coming together but it was mouthwatering and very unique.

I came in with my brothers on a Friday evening after finding this place through the Yelp app, as I saw it&#39;s high rating and that it was in the Pearl Street neighborhood. The place itself is really nice, with a good amount of tables and booths, and a patio. It was &#34;seat yourself&#34;, and we were able to grab a booth no problem.

Our waitress came speeding by and merely dropped off a menu without saying a word...okay. Kind of an interesting start. Their menu isn&#39;t too big, but definitely has some good options-burgers, sandwiches, salad, some seafood. Their beer list really impressed me. They have Duvel on top-one of my favorite beers, and I&#39;ve never seen it on tap! Awesome.

So the food and drink booth looked great-unfortunately, the service wasn&#39;t. Our waitress just continued to blow by our table without so much as a &#34;I&#39;ll be right with you&#34; and we ended up sitting there for 15-20 minutes before flagging her down to order dinner.

I went with their Roast Beef Dip, and I did really enjoy it. Their Roast Beef is house made, and it was delicious. Their french fries are seasoned, and definitely a step above most places&#39; fries.

I&#39;ll likely give Finely&#39;s another shot because the food was good and the beer selection is excellent, but the service definitely left me feeling a little cold."

First, this place doesn&#39;t get nearly the business it deserves. It&#39;s kinda hidden on pearl street next to a notorious dive but it is far from divey itself. The girls that work the bar and wait tables are cheerful, friendly and always willing to help you out, plus they mix a mean cocktail. And the food! Oh, the food! It may be $12-14 for a burger but for a half pound of heaven, it&#39;s more than worth it. They got a new chef shortly after I started going there and she has a way with food that makes pub fare nothing short of divine. Love bringing friends there for dinner and watching their surprise when the food comes out.
You can feel the love in this place, for sure. Don&#39;t believe me? They have a wall of pics of regulars wearing their Finley&#39;s gear. A whole wall. They love their customers that much. So in short, go to Finley&#39;s. Trust me."

We sat at the bar, and the bartender could not be friendlier. We met the owner, and he and I bonded over a discussion of our favorite bourbons. Speaking of which, they have a good selection of bourbons, including for example George T Stagg, Angel&#39;s Envy, and Basil Hayden. We got the seared ahi tacos, the macaroni and cheese and the tater tots. Everything was delicious. We highly recommend Finleys."

The Finley Burger is a must try, along with their seasoned tots and house made ketchup. Tasty salads and a great Shepard&#39;s Pie round out a fun menu for a neighborhood pub putting out better than average bar food. Feeling snacky? Try the caramelized butternut squash or the bruschetta....they will definitely hit the spot!

A friend had the Irish Cuban sandwich and thought it was very tasty, so that&#39;s next on my list to try! Since this place is walking distance from my apartment, I know I&#39;ll be back many more times!"

Old friend has just moved back into my neck of the woods (Speer) from Evergreen and it is my job to introduce him to the good local eating and drinking emporiums.  I think Finley&#39;s is a great place to start.

Showed up about half way through their &#34;first&#34; happy hour of the day 4 pm - 7 pm.  There&#39;s another from 10 pm - midnight.  Some really good deals - $2 well, $1 off draws, $5 house wine, $3 Guinness, $1 off appetizers.  Place was pretty quiet at six but a packed house when we left.  Glad to see them doing a brisk business.

He had The Finley to drink - Hendricks Gin (he&#39;s a total fan), Lemon Soda, Ginger Beer, St.Germain and loved it - $7.  I stuck with agua.  We started our food excursion by sharing a very ample portion of tots - $5 HH.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;re food service but they doctor them up with some cajun seasoning and that great &#34;creole&#34; mayo.   

We also shared the Finley burger (Braised Short Rib, Ground Chuck, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Béarnaise - $12) I mentioned earlier - as wonderful as I remembered with very crisp sweet potato fries.  And, if that wasn&#39;t enough we split the Lamb burger, too (Onions, Feta Cheese, Arugula, Balsamic Glaze - $13).  Not as big a fan of this.  Ordered medium rare and it arrived almost tartare and the accompaniments were pretty skimpy and blah.  I&#39;d advise at least &#34;medium&#34; if you&#39;re going to give it a shot.  The Brussels sprouts that we chose to have come with it were amazing though.  So good that we passed on dessert and got another half order of them.

Service was very friendly and attentive.  Place is clean and comfortable.  Crowd was easy going neighborhood folk.  Parking turned out to be pretty easy perhaps because the Candlelight crowd hadn&#39;t started up yet.  Great affordable, tasty, week night meal and we&#39;ll do it again soon."

However, it seems be a perfect pairing because what Finley&#39;s doesn&#39;t offer in hipster comfort, Candlelight doesn&#39;t offer the good food and classier atmosphere.

It&#39;s pretty easy to get a table here during happy hour, which is when we ventured down. Shhh, don&#39;t tell anyone cause I don&#39;t want to be fighting over tables with some over juiced dude and his aloof girlfriend like in the Highlands. The menu is flavorful, with items you wouldn&#39;t expect at a bar. Think the Whittier, only MUCH better food and a more comfortable atmosphere. The prices are decent as well.

With the Candlelight just next door offering cougars, darts, embarrassment and fun, Finley&#39;s offers the perfect partnership for that regret you&#39;ll feel the next morning. Just don&#39;t tell anyone else about it."

Even though the servings were a bit smaller than normal, they were actually the correct size so to say.  A service equaling a fist size that is.  Anyway, service was great and when the bees came buzzing, we just up and went inside to pay.  We startled our server a bit but after we told her about the bees, she understood.

It&#39;s a small Irish themed pub that&#39;s easy to miss as your driving down the street, but it&#39;s in a nice little neighborhood.

I sat at the bar and perused the menu.  They offer one burger which includes short rib meat, I asked to have that left off as I don&#39;t like excessive amounts of extra meat on a simple burger, but this isn&#39;t an option.  It came out quickly, but I have to say it wasn&#39;t particularly good.  The patty was lacking in flavor, possibly because they rely upon the short rib meat.  The sweet potato fries I ordered as a side weren&#39;t mind blowing either, but I don&#39;t usually expect much from fries.

They have a very impressive selection of Irish whiskeys, and I liked that they had the Prost Oktoberfest on draft.

It&#39;s a nice little place, I&#39;d come back, but I won&#39;t have the burger again.  It&#39;s unfortunate that they don&#39;t offer more options for this."

The bartender (owner) was really friendly and helpful, and the place is cozy and clean. We had a few good beers and some tasty Irish whiskies. Only suggestion is that for an Irish bar, there wasn&#39;t a strong selection of Irish beers on tap (only Guiness), and while there were the tasty standard Irish whiskies, I would really love to see a larger selection. Overall, a great neighborhood spot and will definitely stop by again. (P.S. the menu looked great and can&#39;t wait to try the food.)"

It wasn&#39;t disappointing either, but I would mostly just say &#34;Yes, there was a waitress&#34; and leave it at that. 
We read some of the reviews and decided to try the Irish nachos. For $8, do not waste your money. Seriously.

Now, why did I give it 4 stars? On the small scale, their beer selection is great. They&#39;ve got a nice sized selection for the size of their location, and it wasn&#39;t just filled with IPA&#39;s - as I&#39;ve found to be the norm in many a bar or pub here in Denver. 

Here is the most important thing: 
Their shepherd&#39;s pie is a religious experience. No joke. That is the best thing I have ever eaten in my life, and I found myself reliving my trip to Ireland nearly 10 years ago. Spiced so perfectly, and none of this gravy crap everyone seems to think is necessary for a good pie. I will come back any day for this dish."

I ate the Finley&#39;s burger, perfectly cooked and spiced to perfection.  My gal had the baby arugula salad and couldn&#39;t have been happier.  Unfortunately, we just missed the happy hour which from the website looks to be amazing(2.00 mixed drinks)!That being said, I will be back very shortly!  We were seated right away at 7:00 without a reservation so check plus for that, but I figure it will be getting busier when people realize the greatness of this place.

The beer list is small, but very good quality (not just 2-3 CO brews plus Coors Light like you see on a lot of small menus). And their liquor selection looks pretty huge. 

It&#39;s a little pricey for what you&#39;d expect from an Irish pub, but it&#39;s a big step above (food-wise) than what you&#39;d get at a divey place with a cheaper menu.

I&#39;m confused because I never thought a pub would have such good cocktails. And even though the menu is a small one the offerings are unique and delicious. Again a surprise for a pub.

I met some friends for a late dinner here and we started with the Cajun Tots which are just regular tater tots as far as I can tell but they come with Andouille Creolaise. This reminds me a little of an aioli sauce with bits or Andouille sausage in it. Tasty. They also make their own ketchup in Finley&#39;s - it&#39;s a beer ketchup and quite nice.

For my dinner I ordered the Finley Burger which is a braised short rib and chopped sirloin patty topped with applewood smoked bacon, Tilamook cheddar, and a béarnaise. Pretty dang good burger if you ask me.This came with what is described as &#34;Herbed Shoestring Fries&#34; but are most definitely not shoestring. I think mine were just regular, run of the mill fries.

It&#39;s a good bar to have dinner or just hang out in and when I was there around 9 on a Wednesday it was fairly quiet so if you have a group it may be good for you. All in all I&#39;d definitely go back for food, drinks, or both!"

I came across Finley&#39;s, oddly enough, when I was looking at City of Denver health inspection reports on-line.  Finley&#39;s last two health inspections were perfect.  Being that I am OCD about food safety, I decided to give them a try. 

The burger is amazing. The beef patties are formed from ground short ribs mixed with ground chuck, topped with thick cut bacon and Bearnaise. Is it any wonder that I&#39;m still dreaming about this burger?

The Finley&#39;s beer selection exceeded my expectations.  At an Irish pub I expect to see the standard Guinness and maybe some Boston brews.  So just imagine my excitement to see Karmeliet on tap at an Irish pub!  In fact, the entire tap list was a good variety of beer from California, Washington, Colorado, The Midwest and Europe.

The mushroom salad - good lord, there are not enough mushrooms on menus in Denver and this little goat cheese dotted wonder was fantastic. I was a little worried about the lemon vinaigrette but it was perfect. The beet salad was good, a bit too sweet for our tastes, it had candied pecans and a honey marscapone dressing, it was good and if you like sweet, you will love it. 

Now, the shrimp and grits; holy channeling-a-cajun-at an-Irish-pub batman! It was perfect, the shrimp is crisp and sweet and hot and juicy and lord, bacon. Did I mention, bacon? Seriously, the menu is going to get a go over by me personally. There is also a very nice beer list that I know I will also experience on a deep level.

There are a few wobbles, nothing worth mentioning here that can&#39;t be fixed as they get their sea-legs under them.

The menu selections are outstanding and the taste of all the food we tried was unbelievable!  I am still dreaming about the Spinach Salad, which was served with quinoa, oven-roasted tomatoes, and goat cheese!  Truly one of the best salads I have ever had in my life.  

Then for the main course was the Salmon Fish &amp; Chips and the Burger.  It was so unique to see fish &amp; chips made with salmon and the flavor was wonderful.  It was served with an excellent apple coleslaw that could stand all on its own it was so good!  The burger was TO-DIE-FOR!  Juicy meat, creamy &amp; flavorful sauce, crisp bacon, soft bread - DELICIOUS!  Words are hard to describe how good the burger was - you just have to go try it for yourself!

I also tried the Pub&#39;s signature drink - The Finley.  Absolutely perfect.  Refreshing, not overpowering gin taste, and a subtle yet perfect ginger spice flavor.   They also had a ton of beer options at great prices, and other cocktails as well.

The service was also outstanding.  Very friendly, attentive, and anticipatory - I never had to ask for anything, she always knew what I needed before I did.

They have a cute patio with about 8 tables and inside has a good amount of seating with the bar, tables, booth&#39;s and a warm, fun decor.

The Guinness is always good, and the food has been pretty good too, but for some reason when I think about going out, Finley&#39;s is never on my mind.  I think it must be the atmosphere.  Its kinda like a Fado&#39;s but much smaller with a flat ambiance.  Each time I visited, it was very quiet and people just sat drinking to themselves.  Strange... 
I have had a burger here which was very tasty, albeit a little greasy though.  And I have had wings, which were HUGE and delicious, but a little undercooked (probably because they were so big).  Like previuosly mentioned, the Guinness is good and cheaper than other places in town by a wee bit.
I will be back, if someone reminds me to..."

I don&#39;t throw 5 star ratings around, but Finley&#39;s earned it. With all due respect to the many truly exceptional burger joints in our little &#34;cow town&#34;, this is the best burger I have had in Denver. What makes it so good?

First, I appreciate the straightforward presentation. I dislike when restaurants put too much of the onus on me to &#34;build my own&#34;. You&#39;re the professionals, you tell me what&#39;s good, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. I always get too creative or ambitious and end up crashing through that delicate boundary between perfect flavor and a big hot mess. At Finley&#39;s, there&#39;s no peanut butter or fried egg--there is the Finley Burger. It is has been crafted to perfection. Leave it alone. Savor it.

Second, the strength of this burger is the actual burger itself, not some cleverly-named sauce or excessive portion. The patty is Ground Chuck blended with Braised Short Rib, and mine was cooked to perfection. (I actually noticed small bits of Short Rib throughout my patty.) The result is a burger that has an extra layer of dimension and flavor that is not the result of salt or any other seasoning. No, it is the work of Beef, my friend, as it should be."

I had the wings to start and the beer cheese soup, both were fantastic.  Great flavor and perfect spice, nice kick without being overwhelming.

Next I had the Shepard&#39;s pie.  Beef was ok, the potatoes is where it gets bad.  Instant with little to no flavor.   Stay away from this, it&#39;s a 1 star item.

Three of us went to dinner.  It&#39;s pretty close to where i live and I was excited to find a great farm-to-table Irish pub!  Unfortunately it fell flat.

We tired a couple of their signature drinks:  The Finley, and Irish Mule.  These were enjoyable, and pretty much as expected. The only suggestion I have here is for the mule.  Reed&#39;s ginger beer is &#34;meh&#34;.  Find the local Boulder brew, or something a little less mass produced to maintain that fresh / local theme.

We ordered the Kale salad and sweet potato fries to share.  The salad was pretty good, but the fries were soggy.  Fried had a curry sauce that was tasty, just wasted on the mushy fries.

I had the roast beef dip.  The dip was served in a ramekin much to small to dip the crusty sandwich into.  The bread and meat were dry, and needed quite a bit of dip.  

The others in my party had a bowl of wild stew and shepherd&#39;s pie.  What struck me first, was that the stew was served with what looked like King Hawaiian dinner rolls...again, not sticking with the fresh / local and farm - to -table advertisement.  The shepherd&#39;s pie was tasteless and dry,  Stew was okay, and a little salty.

Our service was adequate, but not stellar.

This review is simply to to warn others that this place did not live up to my expectations based on the website and reviews."

The food - perfectly prepared &#34;pub&#34; fare. I don&#39;t usually order chicken wings so I&#39;m not a wings expert however they were spicy, tangy, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. The accompanying ranch dressing didn&#39;t overpower. My sweetie and I split the burger which although pricey, is well worth it. We enjoy our burgers medium rare and and it arrive perfectly cooked. If you&#39;re going to indulge, this is where to do it. Hot, crispy seasoned thin fries - and a lot of them. We couldn&#39;t finish them all even though we shared. The home made ketchup, much less sweet than the traditional store bought - me likey.

Then there is the beer...I couldn&#39;t get past the $3 Happy Hour Guinness to try any of the other local beers Finley&#39;s Pub offers. Yes, $3 Guinness - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s better in the home land but it was pretty close to perfect on a 80 degree Denver day on Finley&#39;s very comfortable patio. If there&#39;s a nit to be found it&#39;s probably that the music inside was overly loud. But, this is a pub after all. Still I prefer the quieter patio area over the noisy bar.

Service - friendly, prompt. Our server even anticipated the exact moment when my hubby would want another Guinness. Now that&#39;s service.

Everything about our visit at Finley&#39;s Pub was excellent and pleasant. We&#39;ll be back and hopefully Finley&#39;s will keep up their five star rating."

Yes. Fresh greens? Yes. Bearnaise sauce? OH SWEET GOD, YES.

A bar has no business doing food this well, but they manage at Finley&#39;s.

Other awesome menu items:
Shrimp and Grits - This southern treat is done the right way at Finley&#39;s. It&#39;s got a bit of kick, and is full of flavor. The grits are cooked just right, the shrimp is seasoned perfectly. A beautiful dish.
Shepherd&#39;s Pie - Served in the traditional manner. Flawlessly executed.

They also rotate new beers into the taps on a regular basis, meaning there&#39;s almost always something new (and wonderful!) to try at Finley&#39;s.

I am head over heels for this little spot and am quite frankly embarrassed that I haven&#39;t reviewed it yet. First off, it&#39;s right off Alameda down by Wash Park, so very conveniently placed for a bite and a beer after a day at the park. The beer selection is impressive for such a small location (7-8 taps of GOOD beer and a cooler full of bottled selections) but the food is the real surprise. Good , hearty portions of homey, delicious foods like Mac and cheese, big and beautiful sandwiches, shepherds pie made with real lamb, and entrees you wouldn&#39;t expect, like a super flavorful red quinoa pilaf topped with sauteed veggies. This place is just right (and their happy hour is totally worth it, too. Cheap appetizers and super cheap cocktails). Do yourself a favor and swing by next time you&#39;re down that way. Hell, make a special trip. And say hi to Pete, the owner if you end up at the bar. He&#39;ll be happy to see you :)"

First of all, this joint is new, and it still has some new touches to it.  I think its better if I just post some plusses and minuses:

Plusses:
-Trendy hip location
-Small menu (good to start out small and do it right)
-Unique menu (great selection of pub-type grub)
-Great beer selection
-Great atmosphere
-Friendly &amp; helpful staff
-Great looking bar with comfortable bar stools

Minuses:
-Menu is just a printed 8x11 piece of paper (invest in laminated copies?)
-Bit loud even for a pub (maybe put in a bit of noise muffling panels?)
-Lacking in group seating (we had 5 and it wasn&#39;t easy)
-Odd TV situation (if you&#39;re gonna have them, make sure you have enough and positioned just right)


Now, my food was *bleeping* excellent.  I took the advice of other Yelpers and ordered the Finley Burger.  It is definitely a competitor for best burger I&#39;ve EVER had.  I love burgers and usually order them when I try a new place, wherever I go.  I searched Yelp for &#34;Great Burgers in Denver.&#34;  This was a top listing, and I was not disappointed.  The mix of braised short rib meat and chopped sirloin topped with bacon was phenomenal.  The next time we go in, I will try the Shepard&#39;s Pie as it looked great as well.

My reason for a 4 and not 5 was that our waitress was just a bit odd in her mannerisms and made us all feel awkward at least 3 times.  Maybe she just couldn&#39;t hear us over the noise.  I guess noise means you&#39;re busy, but it was loud.  I&#39;m sure it will easy to upgrade to a 5-star when things get more consistent."

I couldn&#39;t even eat the whole thing, it made a great snack for lunch the next day. Everyone was so friendly: patrons, the bartender, and the owner. They had just celebrated their 1 year anniversary, so we got some complimentary jello shots (which are probably not a part of their regular rotation). 

The ambiance is great. It was a little quiet both times I visited, but it was kind of refreshing. The bar wasn&#39;t crowded, the service was great. I am use to having to fight for a seat, but that wasn&#39;t the case here.

Wow, I was totally blown away with the concept of Avanti and how well it was pulled off. Imagine the coolest food court possible, equipped with organic, farm to table plates, ranging from Southern Comfort, South American, and Italian options...need I mention nothing is over $12. Too good to be true? I think not! Avanti totally delivers. 

Avanti is a 2 story bar/food court boasting one of the best views of the downtown skyline available (giving Linger a run for their money). It has a very modern and young look and feel with urban decor, dim string lights...basically everything you&#39;d expect from a popular spot in the Highlands. It takes a lot to blow me away, but I just couldn&#39;t get over how cool this concept was and how many people seemed to agree. It was packed, and everyone seemed to be loving it!

If you want to do Avanti right however, there are some tricks of the trade. Let me give you a little Avanti Schooling 101 so that you can have the best time possible!

THE STRATEGY:
Avanti is a happening place, so it is CROWDED and seating and tables are limited. Your best bet is to go with a smaller group (4-6 people. Trust me, I&#39;ve crunched the numbers) to maximize your chances of snagging a coveted seat either on the rooftop outdoor patios, or in the dining area downstairs. 
 
When you go, don&#39;t be put off if you &amp; your friends have to stand for 20min or so looking for a seat. Grab a drink, a do what I like to call the social prowl...(where you walk around admiring the place, but really you&#39;re looking for the first sign of someone leaving their seat lol).

Once you see an opening, don&#39;t be shy and grab it! People can get a little crazy trying to grab a rooftop patio seat (Think Mean Girls School Jungle Scene).

Here&#39;s why it&#39;s important to go in a group of 4-6. Once you secure a seat, you can go in shifts to purchase food, while protecting your coveted new spot. Dedicate 2 people of the group to grab food and you&#39;ll be set with prime seating, amazing food, and great drinks.

THE FOOD:
2 words for you...TATER TOT&#39;S. The restaurant Mijo serves these beautiful Tot&#39;s that would convince an atheist that God must exist if something this amazing and delicious is on our planet. 
These tater tot&#39;s are little crispy pieces of 24k gold. The cheese on top, the sauce...I mean even now I&#39;m getting tot envy.
Every person in the building was holding a basket of these things and I promise you, these things alone are worth the trip to Avanti. GET THE TATER TOT&#39;S AT MIJO!!!

But not to be outdone:

The Arepas from Quiero Arepas are literally mind blowing. These corn pita sandwiches are stuffed to the brim of pulled beef or chicken, amazing adobo sauces, plantains, avocado...I&#39;m telling you these are GAME CHANGERS. And for $12, they are huge. You will not leave hungry if you order one of these bad boys. Just be ready to stand in line, because it&#39;s no secret to anyone there how amazing these are. 

I don&#39;t write mini books about a  place unless it&#39;s worth it. This place is far and away worth it. It&#39;s one of the coolest places and concepts I&#39;ve seen not only in the Highlands, but anywhere period. You better believe you&#39;ll be able to see me there early and often...and if you do, come say hi! (I&#39;ll have 2 baskets of tot&#39;s and an arepas with me...but don&#39;t expect me to share!)"

The idea here is that there are about 7 restaurants within a building. Think if food trucks rented out a facility that offers booze. This is exactly that. 

Look through the pictures posted to get an idea of what it&#39;s like.

I had sushi. It was just okay. The beers on tap and drinks were great, and so was the cauliflower tempura.

A huge variety of food, a great view, drinks, what more could one ask for? Avanti truly has something for everyone, which is probably why it was pretty crowded around 10 on a Friday night. Even with the crowds, we had no problem getting drinks or finding a table."

Avanti is your place ! I cannot get over how fun and creative this place was, I want to go back !! A multilevel food court from successful, inventive, and creative food trucks in one place ! Yes please !

I went on a Friday night and it was packed , there&#39;s a bar downstairs and then lots of tables and booths with 5 different places downstairs and 2 upstairs also outdoor seating. It&#39;s some of the best food truck eats in Denver in the form of food court bar !

There is a great variety of food selection too; Asian, sushi, tacos, areas, pizza, noodle bowls, etc. All with incredibly flavorful cool concepts. The best part is even though they were so busy the lines for the food places were not to terribly long. Service is also pretty fast ! I went to Quiero Arepas and they told me 10-15 minutes it was more like 5 minutes ! It&#39;s not overly expensive either nothing is over $15, I got an Arepa for $12 and it was filled !!! Defiantly worth the money, I can&#39;t wait to go back !!!

The concept is that this is a &#34;collective eatery&#34; which contains 7 different food vendors that you can visit inside of the place. The options varied significantly and contained a lot of international cuisine. I only went to one place, but the shawarma was delicious. I also heard good feedback about the sushi place. The food booths are separated between the top and bottom floors, and each kitchen occupies a small space. It&#39;s sort of like a food court, but with much better options and a much nicer vibe. We walked around to check out all of the individual kitchens, and then it was just a matter of ordering our food from the place of our choosing and waiting for them to call our number when the order was up. We happened to go when a few places were shut down, I&#39;m assuming between lunch and dinner, so it is worth looking up the hours before you go if you want something in particular.

Once you get your food, there is quite a bit of seating to choose from. The bottom floor was full of tables that were all inside, and the top floor had a few more inside and a whole lot more outside. Part of the outdoor area was covered and part of it wasn&#39;t. The rooftop area had a great view of the city. While there was a lot or seating, it was also a gorgeous day and the place was very busy. It was all open seating, and we just happened to get lucky and find a few spots from people who were leaving in the outdoor section. The atmosphere felt a little classier than your average casual restaurant, and this would be a nice place to go for a date. 

Along with the food is both a bar upstairs and downstairs. Their beer list was fairly diverse, but had quite a few taps occupied by large national breweries, which was a little disappointing to see is a city with such a high number of local breweries. That being said, there were still quite a few options that did come from smaller places around the state, and they had more options in cans and bottles. While there is plenty of beer, the prices seemed high to me, especially for what they offered and the fact that a lot of them were only 10 oz pours. This is not somewhere I would come to just get a few beers unless you really wanted to pay a premium for the location. (The food is much more competitively priced)

I would certainly go back here for lunch or dinner, and the variety of food options is really unique and makes for a great compromise for groups of people who all want something different. I recommend going out of your way to make a visit."

My hubby and I started with a couple of drinks on Saturday at high noon and found a spot outside.  Surprisingly, it was relatively quiet when we arrived and ample seating was available.  

We wanted to try a couple of different places, so we had pita and hummus upstairs.  The hummus was super creamy with nice notes of lemon and garlic.  We then had the spicy Kung pao chicken Yakisoba downstairs.  The chicken was super tender and melted in my mouth but the dish was too spicy for me.  That&#39;s what I get for thinking I can handle heat!

We then shared a braised beef torta.  Oh my god.  The torta was nice and crisp yet tender on the inside.  The beef was perfectly salted and seasoned which had beans, plantains, tomatoes and slaw.  It was a bite of sweet, savory, spicy and an explosion of flavors and the best bite of the day!

It&#39;s super clean, minimalist, has a hipster vibe but not pretentious and clean.  Definitely going back to spend a couple more hours on the patio with a drink in my hand."

It is a collection of a few different restaurants, all in one venue with plentiful seating and two bar areas. The view of the Denver skyline is incredible and the ambiance makes you want to stay for a while.

We tried salads from the pizza place during our first stop and falafel wraps on our second stop. Both were delicious and the staff at both stations were amazing.

The roof top here is really nice, not hard to get a seat or space at a table if you are patient.  Beautiful view of the city. Really fun vibe - just like most spots in Denver. There are even those angel wings Taylor Swift made famous to pose with.

Awesome and not too overwhelming craft beer selection. I didn&#39;t get to try any of the food as we had dinner elsewhere but I feel like if you are in a big group, the many options would be ideal."

Lol I have never seen such a diverse crowd as I did here. 

Here&#39;s how it goes down: It is seat-yourself in the entire place, so you can pick if you want a booth, high top, bar seating, a couch, etc. There&#39;s a big bar in the middle you can walk up to or there&#39;s servers also taking orders walking around. Then you can pick from the 10 or so &#34;food truck&#34; options they offer. Feelin like a spicy latina as I do 99% of the time? Mexican tortas and Venezuelan arepas. Feelin like you want to pretend to be healthy? Sushi and gyros upstairs. Feelin like you want to be trendy? Asian fusion at your service. No compromising is required at Avanti and I love that. 

My torta was huge, my bourbon mixed drink called the &#34;Pecos punch&#34; was out of this world. I can&#39;t wait to come back. Hopefully Denver isn&#39;t in the middle of a monsoon next time and I can actually enjoy the views from the 6.. I mean views on the upper deck. Avanti you a perfect 10."

My friend order wings from the Korean(?)(Maybe Japanese; can&#39;t remember what it was called) restaurant and a margherita pizza from Brava.

We were forewarned, however, that it would probably be pretty packed on a summer Friday night. 

We decided to roll the dice and while it was packed as expected (right at 7pm), it wasn&#39;t so crowded that we couldn&#39;t find a table. After exploring the downstairs and upstairs, we grabbed a table with a great view towards the end of the second floor. For what its worth, the downstairs had plenty of open tables as well. 

I think the hardest choice you&#39;ll have here is which place to try. Walking in, I was smitten with the idea of having noodles for dinner. I immediately walked to the MiJo stall and put in an order for some udon shrimp, with Kung Pao sauce. Heading upstairs to our table, I walked passed the Shawarma place, whose eats looked equally awesome. I loved my udon noodles and everyone in our party was very pleased with their orders as well and I plan to try the Shawarma on the next visit. 

As other interviews have explained, Avanti is set up kind of like a food court. Multiple vendors available to you in the two story building, with Avanti personnel manning the bars on each floor. I am sure Avanti has solved plenty of food choice disputes with their diverse setup. 

A word to the wise - the patio on the second floor (popular for the terraced seating) while great on a summer night, was packed to the gills. Heading up the stairs, swing around the bar and make your way towards the back of the second floor and you&#39;ll find plenty of seats exposed to the open air with an equally great view of downtown. 

So Avanti will probably be a perennial destination for each Denver trip. If you&#39;re looking for a place that pours some good drinks with some diverse food choices (especially if you&#39;re undecided on what you want to eat) you should definitely give Avanti a try."

However, I don&#39;t think people come here solely for the food.

The building has two floors, and the most special thing about Avanti is the patio that is located upstairs. The view that you get is absolutely incredible. Get your favorite drink and your favorite food, go upstairs and enjoy the view. The outside is very spacious, and it&#39;s a great place to hangout with a group of friends."

As the name implies, Avanti is a literal &#34;Collective&#34; of food based businesses, or in other words, a group of small food startups in one place. A smart developer built this beautiful structure, complete with a variety of indoor and outdoor seating, full bars with espresso/coffee bar setups on both levels, plenty of space for special events and live music, and SEVEN small kitchens housing unique fast casual food concepts. 

The kitchens provide these businesses with the an environment where fledgling restauranteurs can see if they have what it takes to bring their concept to market. The developer built the kitchens out with essential equipment, and are available for rent on 9, 12, and 24 month basis. Tenants are able to customize the kitchen layout and bring in additional equipment as needed, and many have created great branded storefronts too! The rent is affordable, giving these businesses a chance, and the developer makes up the difference on the beverage sales, which are the highest margin products in a restaurant. 

If I lived in the area, I&#39;d be a frequent visitor to this space because I&#39;d be supporting some very brave local business owners, enjoy the amenities, and enjoy a really beautiful space to conduct business or work remotely. Avanti is something that every city should have and something I hope to return when in Denver next."

I like to bring friends here who are in from out of town because the views from Upstairs are breathtaking! Try and sit outside on the patio while you&#39;re there, it won&#39;t disappoint.

It&#39;s a great concept and looks really neat when you walk around. It&#39;s a similar concept to a farmers indoor market, however much hipper. 

LoHi is a very fun spot to be in I enjoy that there were loads of young families that actually got to meet up in groups with their infants, but still got to be normal adults hanging at the bar too.

+ The Concept: So awesome/unique! There are 7 different food vendors represented here that lease out spaces on the shorter side for 9 months so you have ample time to try all the eateries, but there will also be fresh new vendors coming in.

+ The Vendors: Are all fabulous! This is a great place to go with a group, because there&#39;s something for everyone! Mijo, Brava Pizzeria, Poco Torteria, Farmer Girl, Quiero Arepas, Souk Shawarma, and Bixo; each vendor featuring cuisines ranging from pizza to tortas to wraps and noodle bowls. You will definitely not leave hungry!

+ The Space: The interior is wonderfully laid out. Each vendor operates within a small shipping container. There are two very large bars; one on each floor. Ample seating for groups of any size. I can&#39;t wait for our days to get warmer to go enjoy the outdoor balconies and seating!

+ The Beers: They have a great assortment of beers. I was impressed by how many different Dogfish Head brews they boasted, as well as local brews!! Plus an all day HH on Sunday makes this a new favorite &#34;go to&#34; for my weekends! With or without the company of others! ;)

+ The People: All the vendors and the Avanti support staff were so helpful and kind. I&#39;m sure they still answer so many questions about the concept and how it works. Yet they still answer all your questions without frustration. As they&#39;re out cleaning tables they offer to refill beverages for you and take empty trays away.

All that being said, grab some friends (or a book) and go check it out for yourself!! You won&#39;t be disappointed!! :)"

The architecture &amp; interior design is spot on and in keeping with the edgy near Downtown locale.  Here&#39;s my take on this place (with my limited experience prior to a Rockies weekday game:

Food: I only tried Souk Shawarma so I can&#39;t speak on the other restaurants so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s all very good as the food and service were great. Pricey though - one  big wrap was about 12 bucks all together but was filling!
View: AMAZEBALLS and there is no way anything will every obstruct it. Very cool stadium seating for games.
Timing: I&#34;m guessing this place would be the best during off times as there is great seating everywhere but the hipster manic tenor tends to take over during high traffic times.
Drinks: SoooOOO overpriced. I ordered a prosecco, was charged $9 and equalled about 1/8 of a bottle. The waitress was kind enough to ask the bartender for a bigger pour on the next drink but it was maybe a splash larger.  Irony - we were thinking it was more cost effective to drink at Avanti before the game but it turns out the ballpark has a much larger pour. Just in plastic. :D
Parking: Dreadful but there is valet parking which is nice. There is a TON of construction going on in the area so look for that situation to become even more dire.  Uber/Lyft will be your best friend when it comes to this.

Overall, a delightul spot, just pricey"

I&#39;m that friend when you ask &#34;Where do you want to go for lunch?,&#34; I won&#39;t reply until hours later (okay, maybe not that long, but still a decent amount of time passes before I decide on something). 

Here&#39;s where Avanti&#39;s concept comes in. It&#39;s one location, with culinary options that include pizza, shawarma, and local farm fresh dishes. The local vendors aren&#39;t permanent (they stay about a year or so) and then a new vendor comes in, which allows for customers to always have a unique experience. The quality of food isn&#39;t lost in the variety either; I&#39;ve enjoyed the food each time that I&#39;ve been here. The only thing to keep in mind is that each establishment operates on separate hours, so although the building is open, the vendor you may want to go to could still be closed. 

Brava! Pizzeria has been my favorite vendor so far, with tasty pizzas and fresh salads on their menu. The margherita pizza (my personal fave) was less than $10 and filled me up for lunch! 

There is also a bar area downstairs that is extensive and varied; if you&#39;re a fan of Dogfish Head brews, this is the place to go. The view of the Denver skyline adds a fantastic ambiance to Avanti, especially when it&#39;s a sunny day and the rooftop patio is open.

Avanti is one of the main reasons why I moved to LoHi last year. Mixed use spaces like this are all the rage across the U.S. and beyond and I think Avanti is one of the better &#34;halls&#34; I&#39;ve seen in awhile. 

Most come here for the food but I prefer to hang out at the bar and enjoy an adult beverage on the patio. The view of downtown cannot be beat. Even on a hot day, it&#39;s worth the sweat. Besides the fact that they have a rose of the day and the last time I was there, it was a dry French varietal. Just how I like &#39;em. 

There&#39;s talk of the dining options being switched around and I&#39;d welcome that option. Even with several different vendors within, the eats are OK. But the ambiance and location make up for what the culinary efforts lack.

Yes, it has a very nice view of downtown Denver, but chances are if you live in LoHi you and/or a friend has a roof deck with a view that&#39;s just as good as the one from Avanti. The neighborhood rests on a giant hill, after all.

With that said, excluding the hardly-unique view, I don&#39;t get why people rave about this place and treat it as some kind of &#34;must see&#34; spot. Overall, it&#39;s just not that interesting.

The beer list tends to be underwhelming (plenty of choices, but they&#39;re all beers like Dogfish Head that you can find at dozens and dozens of other places in town for 3/4 the price), the food is OK but it&#39;s nothing you&#39;re going to want to come back to over and over, and the service is notoriously slow and sometimes rude. I think my biggest gripe is it&#39;s a somewhat pretentious, &#34;here to be seen&#34; kind of place, which means there&#39;s no lack of boring, recycled conversation to be had among the many people there trying to scoop up basic chicks/bros.

It pains me to say this, because I really want to love this place, but it kind of feels like a &#34;step up&#34; spot for those that used to love the Viewhouse but are now 26 and want to believe they&#39;re too mature for that. Thus, you end up with basically the same kind of vibe, only patrons are sipping $12 martinis instead of $5 rum and cokes while exaggerating professional accomplishments to some girl or guy that&#39;s actually more focused on trying to nail skyline shots to post to Snapchat/Instagram/Facebook (while they &#34;check in&#34; at Avanti, of course).

Yawn.

Skip this and check out The Source or Denver Central Market, both of which offer the same &#34;high-end food court&#34; concept with better drink/food options and, generally, much more interesting and genuine crowds.

Advice to the folks at Avanti (not that they need it): start sourcing some better beer options. Good beer usually means good crowds. Also, maybe up the size of the staff, because they often seem overwhelmed and cranky. Maybe also get some live music in there to get people moving and coming out of their shell more. The environment, as it currently stands, is...kind of stale."

It got a lot busier by 7ish. Lots of people sitting outside and it was hard to find a spot on the outside steps. But if you do get a spot here, the view is awesome! Very cool place to drink and eat with friends.

I got an arepa from Quiero Arepa - it was AMAZING! The arepa bread itself was fantastic and made the meal. We did have to sit inside after we got our food though, lost our seats outside.

Definitely recommend for happy hour!"

My husband and I had heard of Avanti&#39;s from several people, so we decided to give it a try.

Avanti is located in a large warehouse type building, where there are 6-7 different restaurants with their own &#34;food area,&#34; and kitchen, which rotate.  If you find one you like, it might not be there the next time you go, because of the rotation, which I am not sure exactly how it works. If I am wrong about the rotation, I do apologize. Avanti reminds me of the food courts located in malls, but this one is located in it&#39;s own building, without the shops/stores around.

I like the openness of Avanti, and I like the concept. Avanti gives local chefs and food trucks the opportunity to get their food &#34;out there,&#34; to give them more exposure to more people. 

This idea is a good one, and it&#39;s also &#34;trendy.&#34; I&#39;m not sure how long this will be around. I believe Avanit is for the, and yes, I am going to say it, for the younger crowd. When I go out to eat, I like table service. I also like comfortable chairs (which there was a nice seating area), and normal tables, which I share with those that I went to the restaurant with, and not total strangers. I want the more intimate experience. Avanti is more of an Open Social Eatery, more for large groups.  This, alas, is not for my generation. Avanti is good, but just not for me. 
Thank you"

Seating upstairs can be a hot commodity, so be prepared to stand on your feet while you&#39;re sipping your cocktail and munching away. Lots of food options between Arepas, Spanish tapas, Shawarma, sushi, pizza, salad, Asian...  The caveat is that you can&#39;t order food from your waiter, you have to stand in line at one of the stands and grab it yourself, then carry it upstairs. 

The crowd is a good mix of hip 20 to 40-somethings or office professionals clad in shirts and ties. Fun drink menu, cocktails are around $10. My gin/kombucha/lemon drink was refreshing and 20% healthy. This is the perfect spot to bring a date to, our out of town visitors."

The bars located on the first and second floor are on point too... Great service. And the Moscow mules are amaze.

Not a place to enjoy a relaxing time with friends and family.

Met here on a sat early evening for a bday drink and meal with friends.

The bar area is weird. There are not really any servers, or none that come quickly.
Even at the bar, they are overwhelmed and understaffed, but definitely service with a smile!

The food - you have to take turns going to order/pickup your food, because you don&#39;t want to lose your spot that you finally got to sit down with your drink and friends.

There are 6 or 7 options of food. They are little windows along the walls down stairs and up. 

It&#39;s an interesting idea, maybe if you weren&#39;t worried about seating it might be fun to meander with your friends and your drink, find something to nosh and sit for a spell...

It&#39;s a busy place, with a variety of seating both upstairs and downstairs. I have to say, they do have great service. Even though you get your own food, friendly waitstaff come by to clean your table and ask you for drink orders.

I allowed it to keep me away, and I was wrong. 3 great bars and 7 great food spots in one building provides a wonderful variety for a night out. My only gripe was showing up before 5 on a Sunday and having some of the vendors prepping for dinner - so I soothed my discomfort with a lovely cocktail. Or three.

A common theme in reviews seems to be Yelpers missing the Arepa vendor - I&#39;m happy to report they were open and that the arepas are wonderful even if you opt to go meatless. Every single vendor had something I wanted to try, but I&#39;ll primarily be returning for some Falafel and a big bowl of Noodles (and maybe Paella, and a Pizza...)

The bar was a good place to be - everyone was up on the patio so the downstairs bar was friendly and a great place to sample their extensive beer list. They put together some interesting custom cocktails with the beer and it was a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

This is, quite simply, a great place to grab a bite and a drink. I&#39;ll be back."

I was a little annoyed that there was a cocktail server who decided to completely ignore me but serve everyone else on the patio. If anyone needs table service it&#39;s the solo parent with the toddler. And Quiero Arepas place served drinks but without lids.

Situated at the bottom of this recently modernized neighborhood is Avanti. The best way to describe this place is a huge indoor loungy food court with a bar. I can only comment on the Schwarma place upstairs on second floor and I have one word to describe their pita sandwiches: delicious. 

Now for the crowd: as the other reviews say, this is not the place for an intimate quiet setting. This is the Denver cool crowd. Seems like friends and socialites gather here as a place to get business casual to semi formal attire on the scene and be among other like minded post college era but not so old people (mid 20s to 30 somethings). At this time, I believe this is the best happening spot in Denver...it&#39;s a must go to spot.

Being from Houston, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anything quite like this place in the food scene. The closest I can think of is the rise in food trucks. Avanti takes the concept on food trucks to a new level. Rather than serving one menu/type of foods, it offers many different types of foods from various businesses all sandwiched in one building similar to a cafeteria. However despite all this, I honestly thought the food was okay. I wasn&#39;t totally impressed by the quality and felt the food was a little overpriced.

I loved the general ambiance I was getting from this place and it was great for groups. The only annoying part was having to find a table for our group since we had a total of 10 people (you seat yourself here). Other than loving the cafeteria-like style, the thing that probably captivated me the most was being able to capture the Denver Skyline perfectly on the top floor. This is something that you can&#39;t really do in Houston considering its skyscrapers are way too high and the weather conditions are just not suitable unless you want to be drenched in sweat by the end of the night. Denver&#39;s perfectly mild temperatures makes seeing the skyline enjoyable."

Avanti, for those who don&#39;t know, works as a small marketplace for different restaurants. The selection of options is great, and I credit the food I was able to try that day as well. My reasons for going with 3-stars is nothing short of the fact that Avanti&#39;s atmosphere can be fun and enjoyable, but the service I received near the bar was sub-par.

The servers are on a shared tip system and therefore have no ownership of a table. During my visit, I had to ask the two servers individually for my drink samples. Additionally, I asked the same server 3 times for my second beer. A beer which was almost cancelled because I had waited about 35 minutes already. 

If you&#39;re going for the bar and some light bites, definitely worth the stop. I don&#39;t recommend sharing at this joint, unless light bites works for the table."

This place is a food hall with good beer and cocktail selections and it is sort of like a food court in terms of food. You go to a vendor that sounds good, they give you a buzzer, and you get your food.

Perhaps you feel like a pizza and your dining companion is feeling like an arepa. Boom! You go to Avanti where you can get both, pizza from Brava and arepas from Quiero Areapas!

This is a local eatery so all of the vendors are in a large building almost like a food truck meet up, minus the trucks. You get your drinks/water on the sides and order in the main hub. There are about 7 vendors (2 upstairs) so plenty of food to pick from and tons of seating. I would have sat upstairs on the roof deck but it was too cold for my taste.

I went to Quero Arepas, a Venezuelan style arepa made the traditional way, and ordered La Traditional (or maybe La Original???). WOW. This arepa came with fried plantains, black beans, cheese (optional) and tons of avocado. Absolutely MASSIVE. It was so delicious and a huge serving for $8. I was very satisfied (and full). I&#39;ll definitely return whenever I come back and try the other places.

My boyfriend had the Monday special, The Queen, (margarita pizza $5 on Mondays!!) which was a great sized portion and was super yummy. I may have stolen some of his (half.... lets be honest.) He also went to BiXO and had the pork belly taco, which he said was FANTASTIC! just like the pork belly (chicharrones) he used to get in Miami.

Chad, the bartender was nice enough to make me a delicious Shirley temple since I wasn&#39;t drinking. 

We went to Quiero Arepas on the first floor after reading rave reviews about it. I asked about the most popular one; the reina pepiada and ordered it. It was basically a Venezuelan sandwich filled with shredded chicken, guacamole, and some sort of secret house sauce. My friend got the la original with the plantains and black beans.

To be honest, I didn&#39;t like the arepas :(. The actual breading was delicious, but the chicken and sauces inside were not complementary nor very flavorful. It seemed like the chicken was unseasoned and just slathered with sauce which while very fresh; lacked flavor and authenticity.

Next time I hope to try to more exciting pabellon which has shredded beef, plantains, and black beans.

A few other things that I liked about Avanti are...
-The extensive cocktail and beer list. There is something for everyone. I started with a Passion Fruit style beer from New Belgium and then I went the Sangria route. The handcrafted cocktail list was very unique and everything looked good.
-The food options. Again, there is something for everyone. I don&#39;t remember the exact names of all the places to choose from, but I remember there was sushi, pizza, Mediterranean, Southern-style fare, and noodle bowls. A couple of the places ran out of food when we arrived because it had been a busy weekend. I decided on a Falefel Sandwich that was amazing! Large, filling, and full of flavor. 
-Plenty of seating inside and out. We decided to sit on the shaded patio area that had amazing views of the city. There was another outdoor bar but I think it&#39;s only open on the weekends.

Although it was a busy night, (Thursday) it wasn&#39;t over crowded or anything crazy. I ventured downstairs to check out the rest of the dinner options, had some delicious noodles and didn&#39;t have to wait long at all. 

There&#39;s a constant supply of water and soft drinks, I saw a few machines around the place. Great idea for those who are not drinking to help themselves."

The whole concept and successful execution is a great experience. It&#39;s a multi-level bar food court. Or is it a food court bar? Hmmm.

Every since food vendor has some of the best eats in town. Pizza, tacos, arepas, tortas, noodle bowls, shwarma, etc. All food is well priced for the wonderful quality. My favorite so far has been the carne asada tacos and shrimp torta from POCO. Avanti also boasts with the most Dogfish Head beers on tap - and it definitely delivers! The whole atmosphere is great with indoor seating, food court seating, covered outdoor rooftop patio, open lounge rooftop and even stadium seating to check out the beautiful skyline views. 

A lot of people bring their kids around mealtimes. I will warn that is gets pretty noisy and overwhelming/crowded at times. 

Perfect spot for a happy hour or dinner with a group of friends. Everyone can try something new while catching up! The whole place really has a theme of community and I love it! We&#39;ve been twice in the first week of discovering it and can&#39;t wait to go again!"

I was already a huge Brava fan before I tried their pie inside Avanti, and I was stoked to learn they do $5 margherita Mondays here too! Our first visit was with some friends visiting from Seattle and their 9 month old baby. It seemed like a low key dinner option and it worked out well, which is why we suggested it for another dinner with a different couple and their 11 month old tot. It&#39;s very kid friendly (but not obnoxiously overtaken by kids either). Other meals ordered during the first visit were the OGT torta (chewy steak but amazing fries) from Poco, udon (meh) and miso tots (amazing!) from Mijo and the bianca fresca pie (two thumbs up) from Brava. 

I liked the fries from Poco so much, I knew I wanted a torta on my most recent visit just for the side of fries. In fact, all four of us ordered tortas - the chimichurri chicken, two porchettas and mine - the fried shrimp torta with avocado, sliced tomatoes, greens and poblano tartar. While all proclaimed theirs to be delicious, I&#39;m sure mine was the best. I&#39;ll definitely order the same thing next time. Their bread is perfectly soft but not TOO soft, and a bit chewy and totally made the sandwich. The shrimp were large and very lightly battered so it wasn&#39;t too heavy, though I stuffed myself with a full order and could easily have been fine with the half.

Service has always been friendly and we&#39;ve never had to wait long for someone to stop by our table for drink refills. We rushed in at 5:59pm yesterday and the bartender quickly put in two drink orders for us while it was still happy hour, which was awesome. I love their beer selection. I love their bathrooms. I&#39;ve heard the rooftop deck is where it&#39;s at. The free valet parking is killer. In spite of a large crowd on St. Pat&#39;s, we didn&#39;t wait long for our food either. It all seems to run pretty smoothly and it&#39;s cool with a group to be able to get up and order at different times from different places, but still eat at the same table at the same time. Prices all seemed decent to me. I dig it!"

The idea is fantastic: bring together a bunch of local restaurants that represent a wide array of cuisines, put them under one roof, and everyone chips in to make one amazing location.

The idea isn&#39;t really a new one: food courts in malls have been around for decades. This new twist, however, is really appealing for folks who don&#39;t want to go to the mall (count me squarely in that camp) and for folks who want more unique food than corporate corn dogs or factory pizza.

Avanti is a hip, light, open and airy location on Pecos with a welcoming entrance and an homage to the old school building. You walk in and see a hostess (I&#39;m still unclear as to her purpose but she was very friendly) and then turn right to go to the bar, or go upstairs for the other bar, more seating, and a few additional restaurants.

The behind the scenes story is that each tenant signs either a 9-, 12-, or 24-month lease, so perhaps there will be a revolving door of restaurants, or perhaps they&#39;ll all be happy and stick around. Currently, there are lots of options like tortas, noodle bowls, arepas, shawarma, and several others that I&#39;m surely missing.

We shared a few items including the combo shawarma bowl and a chicken arepas. It was all pretty good, and none of it was too over-the-top expensive. Since it was an early lunch, no one got a drink but the bar is big and beautiful and after walking by a few nights ago, I can report that it does indeed get a hopping at a more drink-appropriate time of day.

It&#39;s an amazing place to go people watching and see how everyone tries to make up their mind. Obviously if you&#39;re after a finer dining experience, this isn&#39;t for you. But it&#39;s perfect for lunches and a great spot to come over and over again and never have the same thing twice."

Seriously, Avanti should be the gold standard for hang out spots. You genuinely can&#39;t go wrong with a set up like this.

Lets get this straight. They&#39;ve got plenty of drinks and dranks and most anything else that&#39;ll satisfy your drunken palette. There&#39;s a wide variety of restaurants both up and downstairs. It&#39;s classy as all heck. They&#39;ve even got an outdoors area where you get a pretty decent view of the city. Like tell me, is there really anything to dislike? 

Okay, taking Avanti off their pedestal for a bit, it is a little expensive. That&#39;s really the only complaint that I have, and honestly I don&#39;t even mind paying the extra dollar here and there just because it&#39;s such a pleasant concept. I also enjoy that it&#39;s the perfect place to bring a group of indecisive friends. Oh hey we&#39;re arguing about where to eat? Let&#39;s just go to Avanti because they have everything!

Honestly, this spot is pretty much like a food court at a mall. Just replace all the fast food with actual restaurants, replace the soda fountains with alcohol, replace the screaming little kids with hot Denver folks, and replace those faded plastic tables and chairs with some rustically modern decor. Avanti has my seal of approval and I hope to be back very soon."

Good things: view

Bad things:

1) Parking: it&#39;s the Highlands - be prepared to walk as there isn&#39;t a plethora of parking.

2) Service:.....oh wait, there isn&#39;t really any. Be prepared to stand at the bar and wait with all the hipsters while they discuss their lives and how &#34;amazing&#34; it is to be here...or are all on their phones. There is plenty of staff walking around, but they don&#39;t seem to be doing a whole lot.

3) Price: be prepared to shell out $10/cocktail. For this price, you&#39;d expect a individually prepared cocktail, but no - it&#39;s just pre-mixed and comes out of a bottle.

Like others have noted, this is a place to &#34;see and be seen&#34;. &#34;Oh, I was just at Avanti.&#34; (No one cares, and if they care that much, you should probably get better friends.)"

I like the open seating marketplace vibe that has something for everyone, but unfortunately in trying to please everyone they don&#39;t execute one thing very well, but many things ok. 

The beer list is pretty limiting for a Colorado bar, it&#39;s odd they have an affiliation with Dogfish head, a brewery based out of Delaware. But the other taps they lost are way to similar in profile and leave you wanting more, especially if you want a more malt forward beer. 

I can only speak on the food location I ate at, the Arepas spot. The Arepa was toasted a little to much and lacked depth of flavor, and for $9 it leaves you wanting more compared to others like empanada express in Berkley.

If you have some family in town and want some great views of downtown from the rooftop, it&#39;s a nice spot, however I don&#39;t see me coming here outside of that instance."

The sister and I shared some bone marrow spread (fatty and yum if you&#39;re into that kind of thing), the original arepa (stuffed with avacado and a red beans mmM), a carrot latke (subtly fried and dipped in amazing hummus) and a spring salad with pork confit (WOW for the chunky meat bites). Yes thats a lot of food and we were bummed to not have tried more.

The place itself seemed a bit small, and should be expanded to include more hangout space. I would also suggest some airplants or giant mattresses to spruce it up. Also needs a coffee/pastry selection."

Date of Visit: Many

After finally giving in to the Avanti craze, it has quickly become one of my favorite spots around, due to it&#39;s energetic atmosphere, broad spectrum of food options, and the largest selection of Dogfish Head beer outside the east coast (gasp!).

So far I&#39;ve tried Souk Shawarma and Quiero Arepas, both of which I would recommend. While the prices can be a touch high, you&#39;re still getting a great meal in a cool setting for much less than you would at a typical full-service restaurant. Add the lively bar, outdoor patios, and fantastic city views, and you&#39;ve got a winner."

The great thing about it is that you can try a couple different types of local (not chain) cuisines that aren&#39;t going to break the bank. You can also grab a drink at one of the two bars. You can open a tab at one of the bars (for example the main floor bar) and go to the other bar (the top level bar) and use your tab there. 

The outdoor and open-air environment is perfect for a summer night out with friends. It gets busy and might be hard to get a table for a large group, but we did see &#34;reserved&#34; on some tables, so it looks like you might be able to call ahead to reserve a table for a large group. You do see service people cleaning up tables a little, but I don&#39;t think you can get a server. It&#39;s more of a casual grab and sit experience. 

The parking here is an issue and right now they are doing free valet, so you can use that. But, the neighborhood around it is getting very crowded and unless a parking lot is built, parking is going to be an issue in the future. 

Overall, I really like the concept of Avanti (besides the parking issue) and I think it&#39;s been well-executed."

They have 3 bars--two main ones on each floor and a third on the upper level across the seating area. The third almost never has a line, and closes at 10, but they only serve house beer, wine, and house specials. I had a piña colada there one weekend and it was delicious! 

Of the food options I really recommend Quiero Arepas, BiXo, and Poco. Quiero Arepas serves delicious Venezuelan arepas--like a corn pita pocket filled with meat and cheese and avocados. SO BOMB. And you can even get a fresh coconut to drink from there.

BiXo used to have delicious pork belly tacos--now they have delicious paella and some other treats. Today I enjoyed their special, which was cherry bbq ribs and they were tender and delicious. 

Don&#39;t bother checking out the sushi place or the noodle place. I was super disappointed by them. Friends have said the shwarma upstairs was good, the pizza place is just so-so for me, and the tortas at Poco are great!"

There are 7 restaurants that I&#39;m assuming change out semi-frequently so there is always a new offering. Tons of comfortable community tables and couches with coffee tables to relax on to enjoy a bite to eat or a drink, or to settle down for some work. There is an awesome bar on each floor that serves cocktails, wine, and beer. The best part is, when you sit in the area surrounding the bar, you get a cocktail server! So you basically find your food, find a seat and have drinks delivered to you. The space itself is huge and super trendy. On the second floor there is a gorgeous covered patio that overlooks Denver. I tried the restaurant that sells Arepas and the shawarma place upstairs. All food we tried was to die for. We also had a drink that was amazing. I can&#39;t remember the exact name of it but I believe it was a twist on a chilcano and a mule. It had Pisco, lime, and ginger beer in it. And it was outstanding.

There&#39;s not even anything on any menu that&#39;s over $15. And I mean, it certainly isn&#39;t your typical fast food or food truck experience... you&#39;re paying for the ambiance and the unique concept -- a beautiful, airy, and communal space boasting a smorgasbord of quality cuisine. Each of the 7 food vendors are boutique and rotating. They&#39;ll stay for a year and a half or so, then a new biz will pop in. I&#39;m eager to support this idea of local people and local businesses coming together and occupying one fantastic venue. 

Last time I visited I ordered the queso arepa from Quiero Arepas, where everything is 100% gluten free and organic (so said their sign). My arepa was GIGANTIC for $10 and completely stuffed full with mozarella, fried plantains (so good), fresh avocado, and even more cheese. It was pretty hard to eat... no way could I take a straight bite without it falling apart everywhere, and the plastic cutlery didn&#39;t help much when trying to dissect it. But I made it work and enjoyed it. Wonderful flavor. 

The bars have an awesome selection of local goodies, and the view from upstairs just can&#39;t be beat. And everyone who works here is like the nicest most informative person ever.  Thoroughly enjoyable and I can&#39;t wait to really utilize the amazing patio space."

They&#39;ve got the basics more than covered with drinks, eats and plenty of seating. But, then they go above an beyond with some seriously cool stuff like...

+ Stadium seating on the upper level so you can grab a drink or a bite and take in a view of the city.
+ So many delicious options for beer, cocktails, and wine. (They have 10 Dogfish beers on draft, but they&#39;ve also partnered with Prost and use the remaining 10 taps as a rotation for Colorado breweries to show some local love.)
+ 7, seven!, restaurant options. From pizza to shawarma there is bound to be something that anyone you are eating with will delight in. And since it&#39;s a collective space these places will also rotate over the years to allow chefs to experiment and have some culinary fun.
+ They are open for lunch and dinner.
+ It&#39;s the kind of place I&#39;d be comfortable taking my kids to.

I sampled bites from each of the restaurants and am happy to report that each one was delightful. Some of the spots I&#39;ve been a fan of for a while (Quiero Arepas and Brava! Pizzeria); some have chefs I&#39;ve enjoyed (Poco a torteria from the chef-owner of Pinche Taqueria, Souk Shawarma from the owner of Bistro Barbes, Mijo from John DePierro and Michael Nevarez of Bonanno Concepts), and some are new to me (Bixo - modernized mediterranean and western european recipes with a mexican flair and Farmer Girl - all about local and sustainable eats.)

I am a huge, huge fan of this idea of a place inspired by European markets and food truck fests and can&#39;t wait to go back. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have a hard time settling on what to order to eat - shawarma that is sized in-line with a Chipotle burrito... a messy, delicious torta... a bowl of curry noodles... arepas... I&#39;m sure whatever I go with will leave me happy and yet wanting to go back for the next item on my must-eat list.

It&#39;s a really big place with lots of varying ambiance depending on where you sit and what you are looking for.

The biggest complaint I would have is if you&#39;re sitting and eating you generally have to go to the bar to get your drink.  I know, first world problems.  But it does kind of suck if you want to make sure to save your spot, etc."

The ambience, décor, etc. is amazing and a friendly host told us how it works; you order food at one of the food counters (some downstairs, some upstairs) and you bring your food to one of the open tables/seating areas/bar areas (open seating). Once you sit down with your food there are cocktail waitresses that will get you drinks (from one common bar menu). The view from the upstairs area is amazing. The concept is awesome!

The food: Meh. My falafel wrap was very big &amp; fries were decent, but nothing better than typical fast food fare. My friend&#39;s corn soup in a bread bowl was delicious, but borderline cold. I was a bit turned off that workers within the restaurants were actively eating food as we walked up...isn&#39;t that against health policies?

The drinks: There&#39;s a decent selection, but not much under $10. The cocktail waitress came to my table twice to ask if I needed help or was &#34;having trouble&#34; deciding on a drink. Nope. Once we were ready to leave it took us going up to the bar to get our check; she was nowhere to be found."

It had a great atmosphere, cool spots to sit and drink. The staff and management were very professional. We are visiting from out of town, so we were able to get a spot with a nice view. The only reason I&#39;m giving the Avanti 4 stars, is the third party security team, Clearwater security. They are extremely rude and presumptive. They do not give a good first impression of the establishment. TSA is more forgiving"

2) drinks are expensive (Coors Light is $5). This isn&#39;t a place that I would come to for just alcohol.
3) restaurants are hit or miss. Some are more expensive than others, and food portion sizes can range.

- Mijo was fantastic! Great portion size for $11.
- Brava Pizza was also awesome - pizzas are $7 - $11, and taste great. They do $5 margarita pizzas on Monday
- the restaurant upstairs was lame - small food portions and expensive."

Every time I visit, I am greeted by a lovely person at the front patiently explaining the Avanti experience. Even though I know what to do and I am sure the hostess isn&#39;t thrilled about repeating the same thing over and over - it&#39;s still a testament to thorough and awesome customer service. 

The living room area that invites you into the space is a great start to the magical culinary journey you embark on in the adjacent food court area, but the best part of Avanti? The top floor that parlays into an expansive open patio overlooking on Downtown Denver. On a typical Sunny day - this is prime social real estate. 

The highlighted local food vendors are as varied as they are quality. Having enjoyed a few meals there now, I think I enjoy Brava! Pizzeria the most. However, each vendor brings a unique palette of deliciousness to this unique collective eatery. Only the mood for a cocktail? They boast a solid line up of Dogfish Head brews, as well as innovative and thoughtfully-made cocktails."

Her mission was successful and turns out, the cook is actually from Reseda, California which explains why Casa Gutierrez tastes like home! 

I&#39;ve been there twice while visiting Denver and it was a great experience both times. The servers are personable and have started to get to know my sister, they even remember some of her allergies which is so considerate. I&#39;ve had the tacos both times and the portions are huge. The order of tacos comes with 4, the first time I had steak and the second time pork, both were delicious! They also make sure to keep the chips and salsa coming and they are so good! I&#39;ve seen people in our group get the combo fajitas that comes with shrimp, steak, and chicken. They come sizzling hot to the table with fresh tortillas, veggies, and all the other fixings you could imagine. The prices here are great, the food is excellent quality, and the portions are huge. Can&#39;t ask for more than that! 

I know my sister has made Casa Gutierrez a regular spot and I&#39;ll definitely be back each time I visit!"

I ordered the tamale plate and it straight up reminded me of my aunt&#39;s Tamales! I love the fact you don&#39;t get the typical red Spanish rice that is served in most Mexican joints. This Arroz  was bomb.com . The Jamaica drink was super refreshing and sweet. This will be my go-to place for Mexican food.

It was a quiet Tuesday at the restaurant so they were happy to see a big party that was ready to eat!

The chips were flowing in and they were bomb.com. I thought they had a great crunch. Salsa arrived with a little heat. 

I decided to order the supreme fajitas! Man that was a hefty meal. Three kinds of protein, skillet bed of veggies, and condiments galore. Very solid overall meal in my opinion. Service was great and really helpful. For a simple, cheap  traditional style Mexican meal, this would a go to place in Colorado. Glad I was able to eat a protein loaded meal after a day of skiing. Hope my little review helped out your dinner choice lol."

I ordered the carne asada, it was good, but my in laws and my daughter were not impressed with any of their food which included steak quesadillas, street tacos, and I think a taco salad.  They said everything was very bland even the chips and salsa and guacamole.  I did enjoy my carne asada, beans, and tortillas but thats a hard dish to screw up.

I met my sister here for lunch last week and it&#39;s definitely a place we&#39;ll meet at again. The menu is very basic (especially if you&#39;re used to the Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurants that have 4-5 page menus and 15 different combo meals). We both had the lunch combo (yes, &#34;the&#34;, as there&#39;s only one with minimal choices) and I chose a chile relleno and a guacamole tostada, and the combos come with rice and beans. The chile relleno was really good and wasn&#39;t over-cheesy or super greasy, which I was very appreciative of, and the guacamole was pretty tasty (I&#39;m pretty picky about guac). The rice and beans were the standard fare, but the portions were appropriately sized. My sister also enjoyed her chicken enchilada and guac tostada. The salsa was a little bland for my taste though, and the rest of the food could have been spicer too. The restaurant was quiet though, which was nice, and the service was absolutely fantastic. Our water and drink glasses were never empty and we were checked on as appropriate, but were allowed to sit and have a leisurely lunch without being bothered too much either. This type of service is something that can&#39;t be understated, in my opinion, and something I really appreciate! If you&#39;re in the neighborhood and craving some Mexican food, head in here!"

This is by far the best Mexican food in town. The service is great, the staff is great, and they are not half fasting the food - it is to die for. Some local places come across as cheap, gross, bland, or unsanitary, and this IS NOT one of those places.

This place is fantastic!  Staff is very attentive and that is 40% of my rating.  When the chips and salsa come out, I am already loving the salsa, tastes homemade and not typical tomato-heavy salsa.  We ordered the Steak fajitas and the Chile Relleno plate.  Both delicious.  There wasn&#39;t a messy oily mix of too many onions with the steak fajitas, the veggies were green bell peppers, squash and tomatoes and just the right amount of oil.  I ordered a soft and crispy chili relleno and both had great flavor.  I am very picky about Mexican rice, where ever I go.  The rice was fluffy and light, rather than the tomato sauce preparation, it was yellow rice.  I loved it!  Top that off with Margaritas that are not overpowering on sweet or alcohol taste.

We had a ground beef/bean burrito and a lunch combination with a chili relleno and enchilada and an a la carte guacamole tostada.

Everything was hot, fresh, and very good quality. Their enchilada sauce was different from most Mexican restaurants we eat at and the spices were perfect. It was a unique and delicious sauce. Even something as potentially mundane as a beef and bean burrito had some flair and the spices were unique but not overdone. Fresh avocado slices on the burrito were a nice touch as well.

My favorite items were the Chile relleno and the guacamole tostado. The Chili had some heat but not too much since I am a medium spice kind of person and prefer soft rellenos. The tostada had a generous amount of guac and it was DELICIOUS and buttery. 

The atmosphere was cozy, the restaurant was clean and our server was attentive and welcoming. This is a new favorite in our house! I will update when we return. Based on the good reviews and our first experience I doubt we will be disappointed!"

The good:  Super cute interior - colorful, clean, makes you feel like you&#39;re in Cancun.  Service was very friendly and attentive.

The bad:  We came at 10am when they were supposed to be open but they didn&#39;t open up until about 10-15 minutes later.  The food was edible but pretty bland and not at all spicy.  Green chile and beans tasted like they came out of a can."

The waiter was FAST! He was super pleasant and smiled the whole time.
There is no drink menu so, he just told me what they had and how much it cost. I thought that could be improved. I&#39;m not sure I have ever experienced that before. 

We had the Carne Asada Quesadilla and the fish tacos. Both tasted fresh and well seasoned. The fish tacos were pretty heavy on the sauce, I would ask for it on the side next time. I needed up dumping half the cabbage on my plate just to lighten the sauce.

I&#39;m a bit surprised by so many 5 star reviews. The place was good, but could use some improving. If I had the option I would give it 3.5 stars ( just for the record)"

It even beats out a lot of places in Denver. This place does everything fresh, and I mean EVERYTHING. While talking with the waitress on one of our visits she told us they pride themselves in using all fresh ingredients and you can tell!. Even the horchata is homemade which I can&#39;t say for a lot of Mexican restaurants.  Best fajitas I have ever had, hands down.

The service was above average and the waiter, though he knew little English, still tried to make jokes with us an make us feel comfortable. Every person smiled at us and made sure we were enjoying the meal, but not in an overbearing way. 

The food was great as well! Some places can be very bland, but this location has the perfect blend of spices and flavors. I was first impressed with the salsa (which is always the deciding factor)! So so good!! Then following it we got guac, taco salad, and a chimichanga. All of which were impressive. 

Lastly, the margs were on point! And the alcohol content was perfect. We told the owner they were too sweet and he topped us off with another shot of tequila! That&#39;s the way to keep my business for sure!

We were at first skeptical, because a dozen or so Mexican restaurants have been in this location in the past decade.  I sincerely hope this one stays the course. 

I originally went in for chile rellenos, but the menu said Juan&#39;s specialty was carnitas, which is another of my favorites.  Hubby ordered the carne asada, he knows I love that too. 

The key word here is FRESH!  Everything, from the chips and salsa, to the guacamole, refried  beans and yellow rice were so very fresh tasting.  The carnitas was crispy and succulent, the carne asada was tender and moist.  

We will be back in to try the rellenos, and the Sizzling Molcajete Plate when we have bigger appetites.  

The service was phenomenal, very prompt and attentive throughout our meal.  He even warned us that it would get very busy and loud when the high school kids came in for their grab and go lunches.

Let me start with the good. 
Excellent service
Competitive price
Cold beer

The bad
Nothing was great
We had soft &amp; fried chile rellenos &amp; pork tacos. All was fine, but I would say fine. The restaurant was cold and while well decorated a bit too colorful for me

I give the wait staff 5 stars, but the food is just not up to par for Colorado. I suggest 3 margs over this joint. I waffled between 2 &amp; 3 stars, but honestly the food didn&#39;t qualify as even 3 star for me. I&#39;ve had better Mexican at local dive bars."

I was in Denver for a short visit and this restaurant caught our eye. It doesn&#39;t look like much from the street given the shopping mall it is situated in, but immediately upon entry, you can see that this restaurant has been well cared for. 

First, the interior is spotless and very colorful, which is always a good thing in my mind. Second, the patrons seemed happy and excited about their food, another good sign.

The service is the best that I have had in a long time. We were seated immediately and the waiter checked on us multiple times, each time with a smile. Horchata was fresh, delicious, and refilled without charge.

We ordered the Poblano Quesadilla and Homemade Carnitas (listed under the specialties menu). The Quesadilla was under the appetizer menu, but I chose it as an entree since it came with rice and guacamole. The Carnitas were the best I have ever had and came with a roasted green pepper, beans, rice, pico de gallo, guacamole and your choice of tortilla. Portions were large. 

Pricing was reasonable for this type of sit-down restaurant.

I would definitely recommend it without reservation. Sadly, we left too full to try dessert."

The only problem I really had with this place was that there was ONE waiter, just one. He had a kid following him around, but he wasn&#39;t really helpful in the way of easing the load. The ONE waiter that was there was running around like crazy because he had a group of 6 or so, and a few smaller tables. So having him so preoccupied made it difficult to get what we needed in a timely fashion. That was the one problem, otherwise it was pretty good. I would totally go back since the food was good."

I usually only write when I am either severely disappointed or greatly impressed.  I went to this location when it was a different restaurant and it was ghastly.  That one went out and was replaced by Los toritos, but they were never really able to make a go of it.
This time we were moving our daughter and decided to stop by, denied, we decided to wait until the next day. It was a good decision.
The restaurant is very colorful, like being in Cabo colorful.  You kind of expect the mariachi to pop out somewhere or have a street child sell you a bauble.  That might sound a little priggish   but, well it is true.  
But the food, man is it good.  My wife went to the restaurant first and got the carne asada.  She got that the second time we went too.  Most likely she will get that the next time too.  I love rellenos and carnitas, they have a relleno bites appetizer that calmed my carvings and made me regret a little that I didn&#39;t order the relleno plate.  But the carnitas burrito swept that guilt aside. The serving sizes made me wish I was twenty again where I had a hollow leg and ate everything like a vacuum.  My stomach swelled about half way through, but it was so good a to go box was out of the question.  Then came the topper of a question  &#39;Desert?&#39;. Homemade Flan. Yes of course my stomach replied , my mind was screaming &#39;Are you crazy? 
No regrets, it came, simple and with a tan sauce that made you want to lick the plate. yes I hurt a little when i walked out, but I walked out planning my return trip.  all there nights are their best nights."

Read the reviews on here, and decided to have lunch here. There is no host/hostess here given it&#39;s a small restaurant. Just wait a minute or 2 and someone will be with you as soon as they have a moment. Only 1 waiter in the place that I saw, but he is pretty quick. Also he is the owners husband. The owner is the cook here. As the others said, the food here is very good, and you can tell it&#39;s not out of the package. Nice and freshly made like you are at their home dinner table. I had the rellenos and they were fantastic! The refried beans were great, the rice served was a true compliment to the dish, the green chili not too spicy, and the guac here was flavorful! The chips are home made and served warm, and the salsa is flavorful and not too spicy :) I only gave this place a 4 star because it took a bit of time for the food to be served. Other then that, I really enjoyed this family owned restaurant. 

On a side note... Judging by the guys at the bar, I will be back some happy hour to try out their margaritas! Thanks guys for the good food. Keep up the good work."

I had 6 meals to order so it took awhile for me to give him my list. I asked for one of the meals to not have cheese and he assured me that was fine. Now I have given that request many times at different Mexican restaurants over the years and this was one of the few who actually got it right. We ordered carne asada, shrimp tacos, chile rellenos, chicken enchiladas and a kid&#39;s bean burrito. Everyone raved about the food and loved their meal.

As usual, the sauces were perfect and applied not too heavily, the vegetables were all fresh, the guac that came with my husband&#39;s relleno was delicious and plentiful, and they use REAL cheese--I&#39;m guessing panela or possibly cotija.

Trust me, their refried beans will not disappoint.  The chimichanga was big and delicious.  I believe we were served by the owner of the restaurant. He was very accomodating and kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  I was pleasantly surprised when we received the bill. I was so hungry when we sat down that I just ordered and didn&#39;t even pay attention to the prices. Very reasonable!  Also, we got there at about 4:30 and didn&#39;t know that it was happy hour. So I was able to get my margaritas for two 2-for-1! one! Can&#39;t beat that!"

Food was delicious and unique! I got the breakfast burrito along with their homemade sour cream and hot sauce. It also came with a small side salad. It truly was delicious, probably one of the best breakfast burritos I&#39;ve ever had. Plus it was only like $6.50. The flavor was good and unique. The salad was fresh and flavorful. I was very pleased. 

I also got their old brew. It was great, tasty and with a dab of simple syrup it was perfect for me. 

My darling got one of their toasts. I got a little taste and I was quite impressed. It definitely exceeded my expectation. The flavor was fantastic!

The ambience was very tasteful as well. Overall great vibes, awesome staff. 

Five stars!"

The shop itself is unique and chic - all the surfaces are made of metal and are either painted white or an off-color gold to resemble a whale. Also great place to be on a warm day. On the opposite side of the coffee counter is a windowless bar seat area where you can be inside, feel the A/C, but also get fresh air and people watch (WWR is right across the street from the light rail).

Staff is friendly and the Americano I got was good. The only reason I&#39;m not giving this place 5 stars is because I was looking for a place to get some work done, but the music, although the selection was good, was quite loud.

I will definitely come back to hang out, especially to try their cocktails, but probably not to work."

parking: sucks.  did i miss sign somewhere? only one close by is street parking thats very limited or park far away and walk.  better yet, i would actually ride the light rail and get to this cafe 

atmosphere: definitely artistic decor through out.  most of the whale bone resembling seating armaments are nice to look at bit definitely not for long hours.  they do have copper chairs that looks quite Industrial but also very unique.

friendly employees!  super nice.

food: limited food menu and also menu itself was limited and worn out a bit.  very affordable finger food or spend bit more and get other things.  also, place is filled with whatever thats being cooked.  bacon! lots of bacon!!!

drinks: can&#39;t complain but description of their limited rotating stock somewhere on the wall would have been nicer.

i will definitely be back to try their coffee and some burritos."

The decor is fantastic--a community bench resembling a whale skeleton runs through the middle of the room, with awesome hand-painted designs on the walls and floor. A full wall of garage doors fills the room with natural light. 

It&#39;s never been overly crowded while I&#39;ve been there, making it a great spot for a midday or happy hour meeting. The drink menu is suited for all occasions--grab a coffee, tea, kombucha, or cocktail depending on your mood. Hungry? Sandwiches, salads, and snacks are served here too.

Parking can be a little tricky with the train station taking a good chunk of the curb space, but it&#39;s definitely doable!"

The toast snacks are delicious and a great 2 for $3 only! The cappuccino was delicious. My husband said all the mixed drinks were also really good and well made.

When you first walk in, the furniture and decor are eye-catching. There are succulents on the tables, a cool mural that expands throughout most of the space, and the namesake &#39;white whale&#39; spine that makes up the booth seating for the tables in the center. Since it was a warmer spring evening, the garage doors were open and allowed for an awesome view of the Alameda light rail station at the bar area. 

The menu is limited, but each item is unique and well made. I opted for the chai latte and loved how smooth the chai was; the slight sweetness and foam made for a top-notch drink! I also accompanied the chai latte with the Elana Ruz sandwich. I&#39;m pretty sure I was having a sweet tooth moment the entire time I was there since I really enjoyed the sweetness from the onion-berry chutney with the more savory turkey meat. 

Certainly a place I will return to for some inspiration while I work on my laptop or as a nice place to relax after a long day."

Every piece of furniture is a work of art, from the booth-backs that run together to make the spine of a whale, to the hammered copper chairs (I reaaaally want to buy these for my home), to the ornate cement floors. The natural light from the big windows fills the room, and everything is bright and gleaming.

Coffee, tea, lemonade, a full bar.. A very limited food selection of lunch-y options (a few salads and sandwiches). The menu is a liiiiittle strange. Is this a coffee shop, a bar? It&#39;s a little bit of everything. I enjoyed the Cobb salad and local cider; my colleague had a different salad, lemonade, and wine. We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered!

It&#39;s trendy and unique, just a pleasant atmosphere to sit around in and get some work done, read or even people watch. I came in around afternoon and there weren&#39;t many people there. I was actually surprised that more people aren&#39;t coming around to this place!

I had the latte and a breakfast burrito. the burrito came with a side of leafy salad which was a great side! The coffee was great, just the caffeine boost I needed. The burrito was something else. not something i&#39;ve tried before. The tortilla was much crispier and thicker, it didn&#39;t seem to be fried or oily, it tasted more like it was baked. An untraditional burrito, still delicious. For the latte, burrito and an espresso tonic the bill came out to less than $20. (you can keep your tab open, in case you want to keep ordering drinks or burritos...or anything else on the menu)

I love how their menu is simple and not overwhelming. Give their burrito a try and also the espresso and tonic, both unique items on the menu."

As you can see by the photos, the decor here is awesome. It&#39;s right at the light-rail station. That does mean there is some train noise, but on the other hand, it&#39;s a great place to get a drink and pop on the train. OR - ride the train directly here.

They have class garage doors they open when it is nice. The seating is actually pretty comfortable for having no padding. And the cool &#34;whale bones&#34; seats actually fold up. Super cool design.

This place is great for work. They have power everywhere. WIFI is 15/6mpbs down/up."

I had a delicious whiskey drink, as well as the grilled pimento cheese, which I might not recommend to the strictest pimento cheese aficionado  (I live in Atlanta, so there&#39;s that...), but it was gooey and cheesy and the toast was perfect.  My friend had the turkey sandwich, which she loved, even if she totally wasted the bread (it looked awesome). I really wanted to finish the day off with coffee, but a huge group came in and quelled that desire. 

But do this. This space is airy and unique; the service was stellar. I&#39;m kinda sad I don&#39;t live here, because I think I&#39;m going to regret not trying the breakfast burrito. Or those toasts. Geez. Next time, I guess."

Sometimes I switch trains at Broadway. Now, I stop at Alameda instead. Instead of standing on the platform, I stop in for a cup of great coffee. I like coffee but don&#39;t need a bucket of it--so their 8oz cup is a nice option. 

If I have time to sit, I&#39;ll order an espresso drink. They&#39;ve been good so far. The breakfast burritos aren&#39;t really an on-the-go food, and they aren&#39;t the egg-with-green-chile you get elswhere. But they ARE delicious combos of egg, cheese, and veggies with a vinegary sauce that I enjoyed.

I haven&#39;t been after 8:30AM yet, so I haven&#39;t tried their cocktails. But knowing that they come from another great bar gives me high hopes. I plan to stop by for after-work drinks soon.

Cool-looking interior with great artwork. Service was friendly and quick. They had a decent local beer and cocktail menu for a smaller place. The menu sounded interesting. My guest had a sandwich (Elana Ruox?) that was delicious. They also are a coffee shop. I will have to report on that later. Those white chairs, as neat as they look, are super uncomfortable. Everyone was sitting at the window bar on stools or one of the metal tables and I figured out why quickly. Not sure what they can do, but there were tons of small flies and I had to guard my beer to keep them out. They have large garage style windows and they were open, which may have contributed to the fly problem. Can&#39;t give 5 stars because I was pretty uncomfortable and didn&#39;t finish my beer.

This is my go to for wings. They&#39;re the best I&#39;ve ever had. 
I also love their creative, southern sides. Once, they had fried green tomatoes that were served with their white bbq sauce. WAS AMAZING.
When I was up in Boulder, they had someone up at the University of Colorado campus giving away their bbq sandwiches which were INCREDIBLE. For something to be brought up from a restaurant, and handed out a few miles away and still be outstanding, they must be doing something REALLY right. 
I would totally order a bbq sandwich from them if i weren&#39;t so smitten by their wings.

On our latest visit, we work a few buildings over, it took 10+ minutes after our party was seated to get drink service. Another server brought over two pitchers of water and cups but that wasn&#39;t enough water for our table of six and we had to wait another 10-ish minutes before our original server came over with the single drink order other than water was brought to the table to get more pitchers of water. Once our food came, the server stopped by only once more to ask how things were and never refilled our water despite needing it. We couldn&#39;t find our server either when looking around, nor did any other server walk by our table helping others during that time.

This seems to happen to us every time we come into Moe&#39;s. There were only 4-5 other tables in the entire place occupied and you could see service was slow to them, too."

I felt compelled to write about this place since  I stumbled upon it about 3 years ago. I moved to CO back in 2005 and first got familiar with the Englewood location, which is a great spot right next to the Gothic Theater.

Since I live in the Aurora area I needed a place that could serve my local needs and was pleasantly surprised to find a Moe&#39;s in the area. But this Moe&#39;s was a different beast (pun intended?), as you walk in you see a 25 foot fiber glass replica of Jerry Garcia&#39;s &#34;Tiger&#34; guitar hanging above the bar and a huge bar with a bowling alley, pool, etc. I fancy myself a decent bowler and watch both &#34;Kingpin&#34; and &#34;The Big Lebowski&#34; religiously....so this place immediately spoke to me.

Make no mistake, the food here is definitely great - can&#39;t recommend the smoked, then fried wings enough, or the pulled pork sandwich that&#39;s served with coleslaw and &#34;white sauce&#34; - just do it and thank me later. But more so, it&#39;s the people that work here that bring me back, wide smiles and great pours abound without and pretense. These people actually like making you feel welcome, and I appreciate that. 

At the end of the day if you like great eats, great smiles and great drinks - THIS IS THE PLACE. In fact, if the apocalypse went down and we were forced to go to one place...a la &#34;The Winchester&#34; in the movie Sean of the Dead - Moe&#39;s would be my jam! What more could you want?!!?!?!"

Our table seemed to be in the middle of the floor by itself.  Also, the arcade had several out of order games and our server was a little kooky.  Moe&#39;s frequently offers free pickles on the back of King Soopers receipts, definitely worth the trip in to check it out."

When I walked in I was immediately greeted and the staff was very nice. Overall the entire establishment is very nice and clean. I ended up ordering the wings with moes original sauce. The wings were alright, but pretty forgettable. I thought the wood they used (tasted sweet) didn&#39;t go along with the sauce and the wings were very dry. I wish they had had some regular ol buffalo sauce"

I wasn&#39;t sure this experience could top my last one, but it sure did! I had a hankering for some real southern style BBQ. It sure did hit the spot, I left with messy fingers and a full belly. Great drinks at reasonable prices. The atmosphere is out of this world. You can&#39;t beat bowling beers and BBQ. The bartender Ryann was the cherry on top of a great experience. Shes awesome and was great conversation! We laughed we learned and we grew together. Next time your looking for a great night out Make it Moes!!"

Before we went I called to make a reservation for a lane. Walked in spoke to the hostes 3 times and she still didn&#39;t say hello. She immediately asked if we would be splitting the bill and I gave her a credit card and said it would be on one check. 
Go over to bowl on the assigned lane only to find that the lane was broken. At this point one person in our party went over to ask for help and no one came over. I go over and asked for help the guy mumbled under his breath from the kitchen to the bowling area. 
After bowling 2 games we all went to return our shoes and was asked once again if we were splitting th check. I was given a receipt with the incorrect total. When I pointed out the mistake I was asked how much was the bill suppose to be. We were planning to stay for dinner. It I was so annoyed by the lack of competence that we left and I won&#39;t ever be back."

Unless you like spam with mayonnaise and Kraft barbecue sauce. Even more important to know than how completely gross the food is however, is that the device staff is racist, rude and incompetent. In fact, I&#39;d have never wasted my time reviewing this place at all if they weren&#39;t so blatantly racist. 
Went out to dinner here with my family while visiting Denver. My sister in law is from Mexico and the waitress treated her like dogshit but treated everyone else fine. The manager was also totally rude. Never mind the sticky, dirty table we were sat at, the weird, stale genetically modified &#39;cornbread&#39; or the mystery meat they advertised as &#34;turkey&#34;.

It&#39;s very different than your typical casual dining restaurant. It seems to be some kind of strange love child of Brothers BBQ and Punch Bowl Social but instead of being new and awesome it&#39;s somehow just strange and subpar. 
The food itself is decent. I got the pulled chicken sandwich with baked beans and potato salad. The chicken was a bit dry but nicely flavored. The potatoes in the potato salad were huge...it was all wrong. The baked beans were awesomely good! All of the food is served in and on plastic and paper materials. No dishes of any kind are used. 
I see potential here...the food is almost great, the atmosphere is almost amazing but it&#39;s just not. Or just not yet. Hmmm...probably won&#39;t be back."

Our Company had our Christmas party on December 6th at 11am.  We bowled and ate (the catered version). We also had our party at the Englewood location a few years prior as well. I have to admit the Aurora location is newer and nicer astatically, but both places served up delicious BBQ and awesome service. The reason I am putting exact dates and times because I wanted to give a shout out to the young lady who took care of our group and of course the cooks behind the scenes. Let me 1st compliment the young lady. We were a group of around 20 or so and she made it feel like she was there just for my wife and I. She handled all group drink orders as well as about 10 separate checks for beers and cocktails. So organized and friendly. I just had water but my water was never empty. I hope my group tipped her well because she really deserved it! 
The bowling was fun, and although we had a time limit we never felt rushed. Small bowling alley at both locations, but did give off a more intimate experience. 
The Food- Moe&#39;s served us both chicken and beef, along with buns, beans, corn bread and mac &amp; cheese, and cole slaw. Pretty quality stuff! I came hungry and only had about 3 to 6 plates. Lol... The bbq sauce they make is what really stands out. The white bbq sauce was particularly amazing!! A first for me and I loved it. The chicken and the beef or probably pork were well seasoned, with select cuts that had outstanding flavor. None of the meat was greasy, and I never found those occasional fatty pieces you sometimes find at other bbq establishments. The real awesome touch was that they brought out &#34;to go&#34; containers to bring home the leftovers. We did bring a lot of chicken &amp; mac &amp; cheese home! Spoke to Manager (lady) who brought us extra to go sauces. Thanks you guys! I gained 5 lbs. from the experience. Haha. In case the manager is wondering who I am, I&#39;m the one who wanted to redeem a Yelp check in bonus. It was a &#34;High Five&#34;. I thought that it might be a shot or something, and none of us could exactly figure out what the heck that meant? I was pretty persistent on bugging them on what this was. But in good spirt, she said &#34;Come here&#34;, raised her hand and gave me a high five!  It was definitely very humorous. I know this review is long, so thanks for taking the time to read, but wanted to give a shout out to Moe&#39;s for hiring awesome staff, cooking up some quality bbq and in the end left us with great time that I&#39;m sure will keep us coming back for more! Thanks Moe&#39;s!!"

The event planner was very thorough and all of our needs were pretty much met.

We went with Pulled Pork and Chicken, fried pickles, beans, and slaw.  Everything was gone by the end of the evening.

I&#39;ve had situations where the service is pretty slow, however - we weren&#39;t in a rush so it didn&#39;t really bother us.

Their bowling alley is pretty good and they have a huge guitar hanging above the bar which adds a nice decor to the overall feeling of this place.

If you&#39;re coming hear for a bite to eat, I highly suggest the chicken wings and the ribs.  Make sure you ask that they double fry the chicken wings with sauce.  The ribs are usually tender with the right amount of fat-to-meat ratio.  You can&#39;t go wrong with a side of beans, slaw, and the fried pickles either."

The brisket however was very good.  We got 2 sides mac and cheese, which was awesome, and one of their special sides for the day fried green tomatoes, which were to die for. Those were the best fried green tomatoes I&#39;ve ever had.  It&#39;s not the best bbq I&#39;ve had but it was damn good. Service was good, waitress was attentive.

Checked out the arcade just out of curiosity and it sucks. Most of the games were either off or out of order. It was dark and you couldn&#39;t really see upstairs probably would have been so dark if the games actually worked."

Or, at least turned around and left when we walked in at 6 o&#39;clock and the place was empty! That&#39;s a bad sign, mmmkay? Our waitress was helpful and nice. I would love to see staff with long hair tied back. It&#39;s unappetizing to see waist length hair swooshing around while one delivers food to tables. 

I would say Moe&#39;s food was bland because it had no flavor, except for that it was super salty, so that would be false. So I will just say it wasn&#39;t great. The meats had that weird microwaved or school cafeteria aftertaste. Lots of fat. Low quality.

Mac and cheese ok, red beans and rice were cafeteria quality, baked beans were good. Potato salad did not seem homemade, but who knows. 

We thought we&#39;d play some arcade games to perk up the experience, but many were broken and ate my quarters. I played 2 games of skeeball and it miscounted the score. Le sigh

Overall Moe&#39;s is one of those ideas that are good in theory, but poor in reality."

Decided to try it because it is close to home.  The atmosphere was a surprise because we were expecting a restaurant and this is more of a sports bar (big and barny). 
We started with drinks and fried pickles.  The basket was overflowing with the pickles but they must have dropped the entire salt shaker on them!!!!  Heart attack waiting to happen!!!  It destroyed the flavor.  We did not finish them.

I had the Brisket platter.  The meat was dry and I did not care for the little sauce that was dribbled on it.  Further, there were no containers of sauce on the table to either try something else or to add more.  There was not even ketchup to drown it.

The coleslaw was weird.  I had asked if it was creamy or the vinegar type before ordering and was told &#34;creamy&#34;.   It&#39;s vinegar based and almost pickled.  It was exactly what I didn&#39;t want/expect. 

If you are looking for a true BBQ restaurant with a choice of sauces, this is NOT the place.  I left hungry and did not even ask for a &#34;go box&#34;.  My other half was also not impressed with his sandwich.  We won&#39;t be back."

The restaurant has been dead quiet both times and so I can&#39;t really comment on what it&#39;s like when it&#39;s packed.

Food wise, they have a good menu with ample choices. I&#39;ve been sticking with the brisket platter and my husband gets the hot link platter. The rotating sides offer a nice switch up from the usual selection. Their creamed spinach has by far been my absolute favorite and I would gladly eat that as a meal on its own. The brisket is always delicious though be sure to ask for a knife. Each comes with a side of cornbread and be sure to save room for it. My husband likes the mac and cheese and loves the baked beans.

It&#39;s a huge place, with a good size bar, lots of TV&#39;s, bowling lanes, pool and arcade upstairs. The beer is cold and the food is acceptable. 

I&#39;m a Texas BBQ fanatic, so (so far) Colorado BBQ has been meh.  But I think Moe&#39;s is slightly better than most I&#39;ve had so far.  The meat has always been tender. The pulled pork sort of lacks in flavor and the brisket seems to have a rub of pepper, salt, and pepper.  And pepper. And that&#39;s it.  No spice, no kick, no hidden flavor.  Ask for BBQ sauce, it comes hot (temperature not spice), and it&#39;s not bad.  That&#39;s where the flavor is.

The sausage link is good.  It comes with a white sauce you don&#39;t get with the other meat.  It&#39;s really too bad because it&#39;s very good. 

The corn bread is nice.  The potato salad is good. But the coleslaw,  now that&#39;s weird.  Good weird. It&#39;s vinegar based, and it&#39;s sweet.  But it&#39;s almost pickled,  like sauerkraut meets coleslaw.   I really enjoyed it.  They give you a small thimble full, but I could easily have eaten a whole bowl. 

Then of course, dessert.  Today I stuck with my staple,  Coors Light on tap.  They have a double sided bar in the center of the restaurant.  It appears to have about 16 beers on tap.  There are tables on either side.

So that brings me to something that annoyed the crap out of me.  I enjoy going to restaurants for the ambiance as well as the food.  I like to see what other people are ordering,  what they&#39;re saying about the food and such.   When I came in they had all the customers on the left side of the bar, in booths, tables and the bar.  I came in the same time as two other couples.  They sat them first,  on the left side with EVERYONE else.

Then they sat me, by myself, all alone, in the center of the right side of the restaurant. By myself.  Alone.  I actually did the sniff check to see if I smelled bad.  It was ridiculous. It was like, put a spotlight on the loser eating alone.  I even made a couple comments to the lady that sat me and she was like &#34;meh.&#34;  She gave me some BS about dividing stations evenly.   Like, I wasn&#39;t great at math in school,  but 17 tables on one side to one table on the other doesn&#39;t exactly seem even to me.   But then again, its been a while since I was in school.  But I didn&#39;t want to come off rude so I let it go, but I should have just asked to move.  It annoyed me the whole meal.

Seriously, it&#39;s the little things that make or break an experience for me. And it annoyed me enough to hold a grudge,  so I&#39;ll probably stick to the Bar-B-Q joint by work for a while.  If I want to eat and drink alone, I could just stay home.

So if you want slightly better than mediocre bbq and you want to bowl while you eat it, give Moe&#39;s a chance.  Just don&#39;t come alone or you&#39;ll be shunned and put on display... loser."

The food is as good as ever, but this location has been open for over a year now and the service is still pretty bad.  I ordered a Tofu sandwich and was brought Turkey.  I told the food runner the order was wrong, but she didn&#39;t bother to pass that on to my server, so ten minutes later when he finally stopped by to ask how the food was, I told him the sandwich was wrong.  &#34;Oh, I thought you said Turkey&#34; he said, despite the fact that the food runner had announced that it was a Tofu sandwich when she handed it to me.  He ran back to correct the order.  About ten minutes later he returned with the correct sandwich, the said &#34;Oh hey, by the way, you&#39;re not vegetarian, are you?  Because there&#39;s meat in the....oh, you&#39;re already eating the collard greens, never mind.&#34;   So yeah, luckily I&#39;m NOT vegetarian, but... come on, buddy.  

Also kind of annoyed that drinks are no longer included in the meal price.

I think this Moe&#39;s needs to do what the South Englewood location has always done: have customers order and pay at the counter, then bring the food out when it&#39;s ready, Noodles and Company style.  Or, they need to start training their servers before they scare all their non-bowling business away!"

We had a large party come in for the lax tournament in town. Granted we did have reservations, they were able to delay the reservation an hour per our request the night of which was very nice. They set up a table of ribs, pulled pork sandwiches, Mac n cheese and chicken wings for us the serve ourselves from right next to the bowling lanes. It was convenient because we had a bunch of middle school boys and then liked being able to eat and play. A row of tables next to the lanes is perfect for parents to eat and watch them play. I was impressed the good stayed as hot as it did but it was probably because they swapped it out often. 

The bowling systems were confusing at times to run but the staff was super helpful and kept coming over to help us fix any issues. 

Food was solid! A staff member came to replenish our food every so often so we were all very full by the end. And had delicious pudding for dessert :) 

The best thing about this place to me was the service. The bartenders were all super nice especially one super friendly and cute blonde girl who helped me pick our a fruity beer which is now my favorite beer ever! She and another staff member made sure to ask my dad what the situation was with the bill which was much appreciated with such a huge party. They were very accommodating overall. I would definitely come back if I&#39;m ever in town again!!!

Parking is easy right out front in the big shopping center this place is located in."

The is that there is often a happy hour or beer special, though on my last visit (6/17/14) out server was both clueless and useless.  The fact that she was oblivious to any specials was one thing, but the fact that she didn&#39;t seem to listen on the few occasions that did mange to make it by our table made it very frustrating.  She must have been new there, so I&#39;ll cut her a break...

The food is, well, ok.  If it was cheaper per plate by a buck or two, I&#39;d eat there more often.

Plenty of parking, clean bar and restrooms, very open environment.  All in all, a pretty good spot for a beer &amp; some grub."

As for the food, it&#39;s kind of bipolar.  Every meat we&#39;ve tried on the BBQ menu is great! The sides, however - not so good.  In fact, their sides are the worst I&#39;ve seen at any restaurant.  If you like Southern sides made in some weird style, you&#39;re in luck.  I don&#39;t.  I just want simple sides like fries (which they don&#39;t have) or veggies (only if you want them with pork,, which I don&#39;t).  Instead, they find the weirdest, most vaguely Southernish recipes they can and serve that instead.  And if you find a side you like on the rotating specials board, they will either be out of it, or, if you get lucky and like it (like their fried apples), it&#39;ll only appear on the board 1 of every 10 times.  80% of the sides are some sort of casserole, with egg added to most of them for no known reason.  

The service....exists.  You might get a good server, or you might not.  The whole restaurant is like the lottery...sometimes you&#39;ll hit the jackpot, but mostly you&#39;ll be tearing up tickets.

The bowling alley section is nice, and the prices there are VERY good.  Just eat before you go."

Oh, and the food needs work. There wasn&#39;t nearly enough BBQ sauce supplied for our meat, and it felt a little undercooked in places. At least the banana pudding was good, along with the other side. A bit expensive, tho.

Was nervous because of all the negative reviews. We had no problems with dinner service. All of the food was delicious and we had a good sampling of smoked chicken, turkey, and those smoked wings are to die for! They were out of a couple of sides, but we got that they make them fresh daily and when they run out, that&#39;s it. It&#39;s much better than them having it because they nuked something frozen. The place is very big with lots of TV screens and places to hang. The bar is huge and wraps around. The bowling was easy to get a lane and worked fine. There was a little confusion at the bowling area as to how to get service and then how to settle our tab. I think they need to work out some kinks but overall it was a very pleasant experience."

The food was catered style and I LOVED it.  On my way home the other night i decided to do take out for my husband and i. We ordered the beef brisket platter and 2 meat combo. I truly almost asked where our dinner was when i picked up the to go order! Portion size was TINY.  They use normal size to go box but the brisket platter and 2 meat combo were each in a small container. The red and white checkered containers you get small fries in.  I had asked for 1 extra white sauce and 1 extra bbq sauce,  2 drinks, when i called the order in.  Waitress opened each box in under 5 seconds,  slammed lids down threw in bag said there you go.  It look like there was no sauce in the bag so I told her I had asked for one white sauce and one regular plus the drinks.  She seemed very annoyed as she walked off to get the drinks and what I assumed was the sauce.  she came back with just the drinks I decided to just forget the sauce. When i got home there was 1 very small side of sauce in each bag but no white sauce.  The sides were smashed in little containers that would normally be to go sauces,  ie ranch, bbq, ketchup. By now you must be thinking well maybe these people are 400lbs and expect sizes to be that as well. ...no. my husband is 5&#39;8 160 lbs. When he finished eating he was still hungry. I would return for company party but never again for what we got at 40.00"

It reminds me a little of PBS downtown, the wide open warehouse feel.  It has the upstairs game room, some bowling lanes with the big bar in the middle type thing.    

Doesn&#39;t really feel like a comfy hang out place to me.  

The whole experience was rather odd to me.  The waitresses seemed out of sorts, unorganized and spread out a bit too thin it appeared.   

After reviewing the menu which appeared to be rather small, we decided since it was a first time for the 3 of us we would do a 3 meat platter and share to be able to sample a bit more of what they had. 

We decided on the Brisket, Pulled Pork and Chicken with sides of Marinated Cole Slaw, Potato Salad and Mac and Cheese (which was their Daily special).  I found it odd they only offered a few sides and to add an additional side is an extra 1.00.  Just seems a bit pricy to me for the portion size.  

They did something I did think was nice, since there were 3 of us sharing what we ordered they put one meat and 1 side on each of the 3 plastic basket things they brought out.  This gave us each a place to put what we wanted from the other. 

The Meats:

Brisket :  Not worth the .50 upcharge.  Dry, way too fatty, appeared to be baked and not bbq&#39;d at all. Brisket is supposed to basically fall apart or come away with a slight tug, this was nowhere close. Your portion is 3 to 4 slices about the width and length of your first 2 fingers.  There was really no flavor to be had here without the sauce.  

Chicken:  Actually was decent.  Wasn&#39;t dry from what I sampled.

Pulled Pork:  Also not bad, shredded well, not dry and had a little flavor to it.  

The Sides:

Potato salad:  Couldn&#39;t eat because of the eggs in it.  No rave reviews at the moment from the others at the table. 

Marinated Slaw:  I thought this was pretty good.  I am always looking for a good slaw that&#39;s not mayo based and overly sweet.  This I would have again as I did enjoy it; Still crunchy and not at all limp. 

Mac and Cheese (one of their daily specials) It was just ok.  Seemed a bit dry to me nothing &#34;special&#34; about it to me.  

My overall impression, Not someplace I will go very often at this point.  I hope they improve things a bit with their staff and perhaps it may become a place I come more often.  For me it just wasn&#39;t  &#34;all that&#34;"

Friend of ours walked in, a big baseball fan, and wanted to watch the Rockies like we did.  When we told him they couldn&#39;t get their Root subscription working, he said &#34;oh again, they&#39;ve been struggling for a month on that; shocking.  Also, neither ultra large TVs were on.

The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the people listed under pros..if this review was based solely on Ginger and the food , I would give them 1 maybe 2 stars.

Pros

--Bartender and Lowery (the server covering the lanes) were great. 
--Plenty of lanes available 
--lots of seating available
--very clean
--Cornbread
--Heather

Cons

-Our first server Ginger, was pretty awful. She took our drink and app order and never returned. We had to track her down for more drinks and to tell her my order was wrong-- she didn&#39;t take our dinner order. When my ribs returned...still wrong and I couldn&#39;t find Ginger anywhere

--30 plus minutes went by and no one checked on us. We both need more drinks and were thinking about dessert. They were pretty dead in the dining room..there were 5 other tables, so no excuse to give poor service 

--We finally get a server named Heather who said she wasn&#39;t told we had been transferred over to her. However, after that, she was very attentive.

--The food was OK. I have had better ribs for sure, but at least they were tender. The bbq sauce was blah. I was sooo disappointed with the mac &amp; cheese. You could tell it had lots of cheese, but you couldn&#39;t taste it.  It was bland and oily :( If you like a creamy Mac..don&#39;t get theirs. My boyfriend had the hot link and turkey combo. The hot link was nice and spicy like we like it, but the turkey was dry. He also had the mac and the potatoe salad. If you are like us and you prefer dill relish in your tater salad...don&#39;t get the potatoe salad.

-The chicken wings were pretty good...get them naked!! The &#34;hot&#34; wings aren&#39;t hot at all..it was very disappointing.

It was my birthday and as parents of a 9 month old it was nice to get out the house, enjoy each others company and have some drinks. I would return to bowl...but not for food."

I know it was Sunday during football and all but it wasn&#39;t even that busy (now I know why). Not to mention, I was watching the Raiders game and just when they tied the score 35-35 some staff member turned the game off and switched it to a different game so I had to finish watching it on my phone. Regardless of what team it is, you don&#39;t change the channel when there&#39;s only 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter and the score is tied! That did it for me.

I discovered some sort of deep fried, lightly breaded sweet potato wedge.  They were actually worth driving back for the other day.

Coming from Texas, I love my catfish rolled in cornmeal and fried crispy.  The Moe&#39;s team put together a lighter, flour based batter that I enjoy so much more.  Crispy outside and light, juicy catfish in.  It&#39;s absolutely perfect, especially with the cornbread.

The building itself is super clean and just remodeled.  From a Walgreens I think.  It is an absolutely enormous space: bowling lanes, arcade, 20 FOOT PROJECTION SCREENS!  They put some real time into making this a place to spend a Friday night.

I refuse to remove a star because of the crowd.  Two Things.
1. Holy crap Aurora.  Never been out in public before?  Treat people with respect.
2. It&#39;s going to take 75-100 people in there to make this place look partly busy.  It&#39;s difficult to get people to stay if it doesn&#39;t look busy, but a place this spacious is a challenge.  I bet it&#39;s wonderful on a Bronco game day though.

I eat there every time I&#39;m in the area, which in my estimation, isn&#39;t nearly enough."

Went there first week it was opened. Was dead. We were the only ones dining. It took a while to be helped. Our waitstaff gal spent more time flirting with kitchen staff than helping us. They were having a towel whip game. Food was cold. Give it an ok review. We recently returned to give it a second chance. Again, we were the only dining party at tables/booth. About 8pm. We were seated right away. But it took 12 minutes to be greeted by waiter with a &#34;have you been helped yet?&#34;  Really? We were the only people eating. I like the arcade upstairs.. although games should be 25 cents. The bowling is good. I&#39;ve had the Moes on Broadway. It&#39;s better."

It serves &#34;BBQ&#34; like Olive Garden serves &#34;Italian Food&#34;.  Read:  Not.Even.Close.

I met up with Jese S and her friend after a movie and we were all hungry and thirsty, but the hostess and waitress couldn&#39;t figure out who should take out drink order or food order.  They were cute and friendly, but very disorganized and scattered.

The menu is odd.  It&#39;s a poorly organized 11&#34;x 4&#34; sheet, and unless you read it line for line carefully you&#39;ll be confused.

We thought that ordering a 3-meat platter with three sides would be enough, but the portions were very meager.  The sides came in those little 6-ounce plastic cups, which I thought was not only poor presentation but very skimpy and cheap looking.  The mac and cheese was exactly like when you microwave two-day old crusty stuff you forgot to cover in the refrigerator.  The coleslaw is vinegar based, not mayo based, and was the best part of the meal.  The potato salad was forgettable and poorly seasoned - no pepper at all.

We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and chicken, and they came in those little red &amp; white checkered paper boat things you get a small hot dog in at the ballpark.  Again, bad presentation and the portions couldn&#39;t have been more than four bites worth each. 

The brisket was so bad, it was funny.  For starters, it wasn&#39;t BBQ.  There was no smoke ring and the connective tissue had not been heated long enough to break down so you could pull it apart.  The only ring on it was a ring of fat about 3 mm thick, which is gross and should have been absorbed by the meat if it was properly cooked in a smoker for 16 hours.  I didn&#39;t see a smoker in the kitchen which leads me to believe it&#39;s oven roasted, not BBQ&#39;d.

The pulled pork was okay, but the chicken was bland and un-seasoned.  The sauce they give you is very very runny and again tasteless and bland.  No real pop or smoke flavor.  And they don&#39;t serve any kind of Texas toast or bread with their &#34;BBQ&#34;, so there&#39;s another indicator of what you&#39;re in for.

And they have a bunch of bowling lanes off to one side of the eating area and bar and an arcade up some stairs in a dark lounge area.  Very odd.

Pro:  Very large bar and tons of TVs."

Now one interesting observation they have 3 meats:  Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Link Sausage.  But if you want Brisket there is a 50 cent upcharge, who ever heard of that. 

The pulled pork was cold on one side like it had not microwaved evenly.  When we pointed it out to our waiter, he said he would tell the kitchen then came back and said they took 20% off his order.  They NEVER offered to bring him some pork that was warm?

My ribs were very forgettable with no smoke flavor at all and the sauce just lacks any real flavor at all.  I can&#39;t recall when i have had ribs that were so tasteless.  The Link sausage was warm and the skin was incredibly tough, the meat inside was pretty tasty but again i would never know that it was BBQd vs being put in an oven.


The sides, cornbread was nice, Mac n Cheese was pretty cool, not cold but no where near hot and so it was just kind of a dried lump of elbows with a little bit of cheese and no real flavor.  The Jambalaya was tasty but again suffered from being cold.
Mind you the place was not busy and counting the kitchen and bar staff we saw 11 people, and we could see the pickup counter from our table.

For being a place with multiple locations you would think they would have certain things worked out, like having someone actually greet you at the door, and maybe even explain what they had to offer, and maybe what they were offering for happy hour or specials for the day?  Maybe the staff could be dressed so you could actually tell who was a waiter, maybe it was because the place was cold, ( their is no ceiling so all the heat goes out the metal roof) but a few of the wait staff had jackets on over their Moe&#39;s shirts and other just had street clothes.  i saw one woman with long reddish hair working in the kitchen area without a hair net.

The menu is also a cramped 4&#34; wide strip of paper, which made just reading it awkward.  The waiter just put down our bill with no tray of any sort, we paid in cash and it was quite a while before the waiter came back with our change.  The place is all open so it was not difficult to see what he was doing.  We received the  bills back folded as he had put our change in his pocket.


i would not go back and here would recommend you look elsewhere, i don&#39;t believe in mentioning other places in my reviews but there are quite a few places with better BBQ,  I have not had worse so anyplace you pick will be better."

My server Travis gave a great tour of the menu. He recommended the pulled pork was succulent the chicken was phenomenal and wings as an app, on point. The sides were just amazing I had the grits and collard greens and it reminded me of my trips down to NOLA. This is the place to be in aurora, 8 lanes of bowling and more TVs then a best buy on Black Friday. Definitely a spot I will be bringing all my friends to in the future."

I haven&#39;t dropped a bad rating in a while and had to think this one over. For the price Moe&#39;s is a great spot to take a group to watch the Broncos, some local jam bands or bowling which is a GOOD thing! The food is alright but easy to share both the food and the bill which is a GOOD thing too. 

We grabbed seats early for Broncos playoff game day and sure it was busy but not enough where every server was too busy to greet our table. After 10 minutes had passed we finally were greeted and dropped out drink orders off, 6 coors lights.... and it begins.

EVERY MINUTE OR SO SOMETIMES EVEN MORE: A server, a busboy, a dude wearing a moe&#39;s shirt would stop by asking if we needed something. I wish I were exaggerating but I wasn&#39;t. This went on for a solid 25 minutes, adding salt to the wounds our beers still havent hit the table. The server finally gets the beers AND TAKES OFF without asking what we would like to eat. Um ok? 

Another few minutes pass and a wandering server asks if we would like another round -.- Wow dude! Kickoff barely started and this is legit happening. After grabbing another round of drinks and food things seemed like it was taking a turn for the better. Food was on the table FAST, beer was getting dropped on the double and servers were leaving us alone. The wings are meaty and packed with juicy flavor but everything else is rather meh. Avoid the cornbread it tasted like they finally thawed it out last week. The brisket was strangely cold somehow as the food was very quick to arrive. 

And suddenly like a wrath of irritated bowels it happened again... server after server after server after server after server after servers AFTER SERVER after busboy after dude with a moe shirt after server would stop by the table and ASK IF WE ARE OK. DUDE! WHAT HAPPENED TO SECTIONS TO ORGANIZATION TO DIGNITY!? I get you are busy and you all trying to help one another but how far is too far when I am literally screaming GO AWAY to anything wearing a Moe&#39;s BBQ shirt just so I can enjoy time watching the game with friends and family. 

So congrats Moe&#39;s you have officially earned the worst best worst over service I have ever received and it will be seriously hard pressed to consider returning here to enjoy a busy sunday night... lucky for you football season is almost over so maybe your management can spend time training their staff on how to wait tables and best practice. 

Also parents with children: Just because the place has pinball and bowling lanes DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN RUN AROUND SCREAMING... this isn&#39;t chuckee-cheese dammit!

Evidently, the persons cooking the food have never had BBQ. Steaming some meat and throwing BBQ sauce on it does not meet my expectations. No smoke flavor. 

The sides are good, but they are served in what most restaurants use for salad dressing. If you called it Moe&#39;s roasted pork, or roasted chicken, it wouldn&#39;t set the expectation of BBQ. Just can&#39;t get past the fact that someone thinks this is BBQ.

The space is a very intimidating open warehouse, with a bar in the middle. Even with 50 people, the place seems empty (and scary). I found the service to be inattentive and slow, with surly servers. 

Not making any plans to go back."

The first clue was that they only have one type of barbecue sauce, and it was mustard based.  No typical barbecue sauce, and none available upon request.  Second clue, they were out of the special sides at 7:00 PM on a Saturday.  I guess they didn&#39;t expect them to be ordered, even though our server suggested them. Both of the special sides we ordered were out, and then when we settled on beans, they brought potato salad instead.  The two meat platter was cold, and the briscut was terrible.  The pulled pork was dry, and without accompanying sauce, if you do not like mustard based sauce.  Both meats were served together in a small paper basket, and you couldn&#39;t tell which was which. Not what a platter should be. The Rib platter with pickles did not have much taste.  Their idea of pickles are two very thin slices, about the size of a dime.

My husband wanted to try this place because we love ribs and it is close to our home.

The prices were typical of a rib restaurant, but the sizes of the servings were very small the worst I have had at a rib restaurant."

Place is spacious, so we got seated right away, no wait time at all - very good, especially when every minute counts. Menu is easy to navigate and pretty self explanatory. We ordered BBQ RIBS, don&#39;t recall exact name of it but ribs is what we got. Cooked well and tender, tasted good. Not as good as J&amp;N at southlands but still.
Portion size is just what it needs to be. Food was good, the only thing I did not like is the cornbread - it smelled like a cooking oil, its obvious that it would have some on it, but this oil probably was not a good quality or perhaps there was something wrong with the owen - I love cornbread and always order it, if it is served. This one is no go. Sadly.
 Overall experience 4 stars.

This is certainly a place to go simply to say you&#39;ve been. It&#39;s like Casa Bonita; you don&#39;t really go for the food. Bowling, billiards, video games, bar, then if you have time, the food.

The place was clean. Almost, too clean for a BBQ joint. But again, calling this place a &#39;joint&#39; would be a disservice to the actual joints out there. This is more like a casual dining franchise kind of experience. The bar is well stocked with about a dozen quality beers on tap. The arcade was a flashback, but know one thing...THEY HAVE DONKEY KONG! And it works! Felt looked intact on the pool tables and the bowling lanes looked well kept. Gotta say that the massive TVs would be a huge distraction if one were actually trying to bowl. They are floor to ceiling displays at the end of the lanes, just above the pins.

The food. Everything else is nice, right? At our table, we had brisket, pork, and bless her heart, smoked tofu. Why such a thing exists is beyond me, but the stepson&#39;s vegetarian girlfriend was delighted with it. I ordered the brisket and was pleased. It wasn&#39;t top shelf, but it is better than many of the BBQ places offer here in Colorado. I&#39;m from Texas, so standards for brisket are very high. Stepson had the pork and liked it. In fairness, he is from Florida so his BBQ standards are terribly low across the board. Even still, the pork wasn&#39;t bad at all. I also sampled a couple of their ribs. That was a mistake! The McRibs are of vastly higher quality than the ribs at Moe&#39;s. They are really just that bad. I&#39;m considering filing a suit for pain and suffering to my psyche. The sides helped...a lot! Their &#34;banana&#34; (not the correct: &#34;nana&#34;) pudding was a nice treat. Made me go home and make some for real! Still, it was good. The pickle chips alone could carry a restaurant. If you go here, get the pickle chips!

Overall, it probably beat my expectations. I was expecting junk BBQ and was happy to discover that it is at least mediocre. Again, I really didn&#39;t go there for the food; just the experience. On that issue, Moe&#39;s did nicely. Service was worth about a 12% tip, given how not busy they were when we went in, but our server was pleasant. I&#39;ll give him the benefit of the doubt since it was only his second day on the job.

I can&#39;t give this place 4 stars, because they still have &#34;BBQ&#34; in the name and to do that, there should be a higher bar. If it wasn&#39;t for the food, I probably would give it 4 stars. I also can&#39;t give it 2 stars, because overall it was enjoyable and as I said, they beat my expectations. So, 3 stars it is. AND yes, I would go back."

They have Mississippi Mud pie, but only certain nights, so I didn&#39;t get any.
They have NO Mac &amp; Cheese...No corn, no french fries, no baked potato. :(
I was so sad. 
2 down 2 to go. I ordered brisket sandwich that came with 2 sides. I ended up having potato salad, which tasted possibly homemade, but no difference between it and that crappy Reeser&#39;s store bought stuff, &amp; cornbread, dry and didn&#39;t taste of corn. 
Place was clean enough, they have an arcade and a few bowling lanes, but they were full and we didn&#39;t feel like waiting. 
Our services was nice enough, but didn&#39;t really know anything about the menu, specifically what kinds of meat the different sausages and hot links had in them.

The outside doesn&#39;t look like you would expect a high end steak house to look.  The inside of the restaurant is intimate (small), dark, and beautiful, with a throwback feel.

We started off with the saganki (read: Flaming cheese).  The flavor of the cheese was very good, and the taste was unique.  The star of the show is the steak.  They have sauces they will gladly add to your steak, but I skipped the béarnaise and crab, and ordered it plain.  I&#39;m glad I did.  My ribeye was seared to perfection, and so flavorful...it was one of the best steaks I have had outside of Chicago.  The asparagus and mashed potatoes were done well.  

The meal was amazing, but the service here is exceptional.  I have not been to a place with better service.  Its one thing for the manager to come and ask if everything is ok, it&#39;s another for him to fix the slightest issue (which he did before the customer noticed or complained).  There is parking in the back, but it was full, as was most of the street, so you may have to walk a bit.  So worth it."

Our bartender was very attentive and nice.  My filet mignon was cooked perfectly.  The lobster bisque was not as lobstery as I&#39;ve had before, but still delicious.  There is a decent wine menu, as well.  

I like the ambiance here.  It&#39;s a little dark, nice for a date night.  Overall, a great experience."

My husband and I went on a Saturday or our anniversary for a 7:30 reservation. We arrived early and grabbed at seat at the bar, which was lively with lot&#39;s of people eating dinner and watching the college game. It was a fun atmosphere. Just before 7:30, the Host/Owner came up and said if we didn&#39;t mind waiting a little longer, he had a much nicer table he could give us. No brainer, had another glass of wine and it was worth the wait. We were seated upstairs where it was significantly quieter and very romantic. 

Our Server Stephen was very knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu. We had the flaming cheese because everyone raved about it-it&#39;s just as good as everyone has said here. Gooey, hot and delicious, I could have eaten it all night. Escargot was a garlicky, buttery dream, served with toasted breadpoints which also went well with the cheese. So far so so good-moved on the the salad and soup. Again, just as described, the lobster bisque was perfectly balanced, just the right amount of creme to sherry, to pepper-again I could have eaten a gallon of it. Salad was a typical dinner salad-well dressed, not too watery. I think next time I&#39;d order a wedge to share instead, but it was fine and a nice break from all the rich food. On to the star of the show-the steaks. I can easily say it was the BEST filet I have ever had (and I like my steak, Shanahans, Del Frisco, Elways, Capital Grill, Perry&#39;s-been to them all). I requested Oscar style and the Bearnaise was also perfect; not an egg-y hollandaise knock off from a packet. The crab was sweet and fresh and my filet was perfectly cooked. I wanted it medium rare without the red cold center, but not medium. Tough to pull off, but Stephen knew exactly how to request it and it was perfect, melt in my mouth, not sinewy or bland. My husband had the extra thick cut of ribeye and his was perfect also. He can be difficult because he likes the flavor of the ribeye, but not a big fan of how chewy or fatty it can be on the sides. Not this time-it was exceptional. We had the lemon sponge cake and creme brulee for desert-fantastic. The sponge cake was light, and tart and the creme brulee was rich and smooth. 

Overall, the food was exceptional and so was the service. The family touches and sincere attention to their guests make you want to return.  There is an authenticity to everyone who works here that we encountered. We never felt rushed to leave and truly felt like the staff was  happy to celebrate our special night with us. We will most certainly be back and I HIGHLY recommend this place."

My husband&#39;s 40th birthday was the perfect occasion to go!  I called ahead for reservations, I wanted to make sure we had a private, romantic table.  They did not disappoint.  We were seated upstairs, at the window and by the fireplace. The service was impeccable. I had the Lemon Drop and it was so delicious.  My husband had the gangster steak and it was cooked to perfection!  I ordered the pork chop and it was huge, juicy and flavorful.  My baked potato was fluffy, buttery and everything you expect a baked potato to be.  They knew we were there for my husbands birthday so they surprised us with a slice of the most decadent cake, it was amazing.  They also offered us two shots of Ouzo on the house.  We made a pact to bring our children here every Christmas season as a special celebration. We were so satisfied and happy.  We both fell in love with this place.  This will also be our go to for birthdays and our anniversary. Service was impeccable!!"

I love the fact that the sides are included in your meal! They don&#39;t cost extra! 

MUST TRY: The melted cheese! Yummy! They bring it to the table and put it on fire right by the table (great little show). 

I had the Filet Mignon, my included side of choice was the mashed potatoes and it came with asparagus. The steak was cooked to perfection! 

The service was on point, so classy and upscale!

The building doesn&#39;t look like much as it backs up to a Taco Bell, but  as the saying goes don&#39;t judge a book by the cover. The interior is very swank with a large bar and dining room to the left.

The owners are Kosta &amp; Pete (Greek brothers) who have owned thus restaurant and many others for years.

What separates Steakhouse 10 from others is the exceptional level of service. It is by far the best at any steakhouse I have been to in Denver, Las Vegas, New York, etc.

My most recent experience was for my wedding dinner for 25 people. Pete worked with my fiancée (now wife) and I to arrange the menu &amp; napkins/decorations, show us the upstairs room ( we were able to reserve it strictly for our event) and even made items not normally on the menu.

For our cocktail/appetizer hour we had shrimp cocktail, chicken skewers and tyropites/spanokopita. All were delicious and they brought more as people quickly devoured everything. My aunt &amp; Uncle brought a huge bottle of proseco, which was chilled perfectly by the restaurant.

The waitresses and waiter assigned to our party were so friendly always grabbing drinks (upstairs room has a beautiful wood bar) filling water and doing everything to make our evening memorable.

For the rest of our meal we had saganaki (flaming Greek cheese) with their house bread and butter followed by the house salad with raspberry vinaigrette and then a choice of ribeye steak, Mediterranean chicken or salmon. All entrees came with their delicious mashed potatoes and asparagus. They cook steak to order and my medium rare was perfection. 

As my wife is gluten free Steakhouse 10 allowed us to bring in a cake to celebrate. The cake table was adorned with roses and Hershey kisses. 

I couldn&#39;t have asked for better food or better service.

5 stars definitely for Steakhouse10"

For steakhouse prices, the entrees come with two sides!  Not many places like this do that so it was welcome and made the high price that much better.  The steak was perfect and cooked exactly how I requested.

Highly recommend the saganki appetizer!  Cheese that is lit on fire with brandy on top! Awesome flavor and great little show added with the fire.

Waiters were great and the restaurant was very cozy.  Highly recommend for date nights!"

And better yet, you also get a soup or salad with your entree!!! Unless you&#39;re really hungry, no need for an app at all. So yes, it&#39;s $45-70 for a damn good well cooked steak/salmon/crab/lobster whatever - but it&#39;s more than just an amazing piece of meat!

There&#39;s not much parking in the restaurant lot but there&#39;s more across the street. Inside is DARK! We were seated upstairs and it took a sec to find your footing &amp; then for your eyes to adjust. 

I had a special of filet minion with crab and a delicious Bearnaise sauce, Idaho potato &amp; asparagus. Lobster Bisque before it. The crab was cooked so beautifully and the steak was perfect. The Bisque was great but I should have got the cracked pepper on it. The table had also got a few apps too so I got to try some flaming goats cheese which was awesome and gooey, yummy garlicy escargot, and some very flavorful crab cakes. And to top it all off a shot of Ouzo! Dessert sounded divine but we were too full!

My mother in law got the Salmon and is still raving about it 3 days later. Says it&#39;s the best piece of Salmon she&#39;s ever had. My father in law had pepper steak and said that it was good and peppery. 

Tip: We were drinking &#39;The Prisoner&#39; for $80 a bottle. The Magnum is $210...silly I know but unless they change that ridiculous price, stick with the regular bottles!!"

This smaller than we are used to steakhouse was top notch.   The great experience started with the reservation and did not end until we left.  Service was excellent, wine was perfect, and it was nice to have an &#34;all inclusive&#34; steak dinner.  Although not a problem for most, my steak was undercooked. More a med/rare vs med/well.  Aside from this it was perfect.  Very tender steak, delicious asparagus, and huge potato.  
Would definitely come back if in the area."

They always have a full wait staff to always make sure you are comfortable and happy.  If you want to dine with the best ask for George.  He is the only server we have had there because he took such good care of us the first time we went there, we just request him.  He is amazing.  He will take the best care of you.  Now for the food!  The steaks are incredible they use quality beef and they cook their steaks to perfection.  You can top the steaks with several different choices of sauce or have it all natural.  My favorite is to do the filet oscar style.  My husband always goes for the ribeye and on occasion they have the bone in ribeye.  Both steaks are always delicious.  All the sides are always fresh.  They make great drinks.  It is pricey but great place to enjoy a great steak and a good drink."

Friendly service - that was very good - greeted at the door (by the owner?)
Our server was terrific.

Good menu selections, but for a $47 steak - it just didn&#39;t quite match up to what I was expecting.  Cooked to order, but kind of bland.  Asparagus was blah, too.  At $30, I&#39;d give this a 4 star rating.

Bathroom is cramped (I bumped the guy washing his hands with the door - nowhere for him to stand other than where the door opens).

One more nit - I get the &#34;Opa!&#34; when the flaming cheese is delivered, but don&#39;t yell at the top of your lungs before the &#34;Opa!&#34; - startling and interrupted conversation (and was 20db louder than the &#34;Opa!&#34;)"

Jamie was our server and she did a wonderful job, unfortunately she couldn&#39;t do anything about the food.  I took my parents here when they visited from out of town and thought we would have a great dinner.  They don&#39;t like to spend too much on food but we love a good steak so I thought this would be a treat. 

All of the entrees come with a starter salad or soup and two sides which is great, makes you feel better about paying $42 for a meal.   We all got the salad to start, my dad and I were fine with ours but my moms was watery, she only took one or two bites.  Then the meals came.  I ordered the filet which was good, not the best I have ever had but still good.  My dad ordered the ribeye which is known for being a fatty cut of meat but he said most of it was inedible and certainly wasn&#39;t the 14 oz it says it is.  My mom got the chicken oscar...I know, who orders chicken at a steak house?! Chicken or not, it should still be cooked well for $32.  It was dry, so much so that she could barely cut it.  The crab meat on top was alright, it was stringy and a bit overdone but she enjoyed that part.   

When Jamie came by to take our plates, she noticed that my mom barely touched the chicken.  She was very apologetic and brought us a piece of chocolate cake on the house and they ended up comping the meal. That being said, I would rather pay for a great meal then suffer through a bad meal for free. 

In the end I was disappointed with the evening, was really hoping we would have one of the great experiences I read about here on Yelp!  Just wasn&#39;t meant to be."

We were searching for a nice place to take my Dad for his 83rd birthday, a special occasion that deserves someplace special. How often do you turn 83, right! One of my husband&#39;s co-workers recommended Steakhouse 10 to him, so it&#39;s been on our list. I am so glad we went!

This restaurant is easy enough to miss, as it&#39;s in a non-descript building. I would never know it was there! 

The interior is dark, decorated in dark browns, blacks, tans, white. It&#39;s gorgeous inside, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really said that about a restaurant, so this is a first for me.  The interior is special, a perfect fit for special occasions. You will feel special and are treated like a king or queen when you are inside.  Service is impeccable!  Nothing is missed, nothing is overlooked. The attention to details is perfect! I could not find any flaws. There is also a small bar area, which I would not mind going to, sitting back, enjoying an appetizer, and watching the game on one of the televisions.

The food is wonderful, excellently prepared, with the right amount of seasonings, and the plating is gorgeous as well. The food looks good and it&#39;s very tempting to not eat it, but you know you have to dive in.  Enjoy! Savor every bite! Prices are expensive, and you will have a lighter wallet when you leave,  but as I said, this restaurant is for special occasions, and special occasions are worth it. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for special celebration, such as milestone birthdays, like my Dad&#39;s 83rd, anniversaries, 50th anniversaries, proposals/engagements, etc.  You won&#39;t miss!

We had the Saganaki for $14 (an appetizer)
This is their world famous imported kasseri cheese fried and flamed with brandy, which is their house speciality.  It was mouth watering delicious! The short show that you get with it is impressive too, and that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say. It&#39;s a surprise that in the years and years that they&#39;ve been open, there has not been a fire, ant that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say. They know what they are doing.

My husband and I split (with a split plate fee, which is only fair) the 10 oz New York Strip. It was cooked to perfection, and absolutely delish! The asparagus was very good, and when they found out that I have a dietary restriction with garlic, the waitress went back to the kitchen, and brought out a new side order of asparagus without their seasoning, which includes garlic. Thank you. I also had the baked potato, and my husband had the mashed potatoes. I had the house salad, which was good, and my husband had the lobster soup, which he said was very good.

My Dad had the 1 pound pork chop, and WOW! it was huge! A large portion, that two people can easily share. He only ate half, and took the other half home. Dad had the salad as well.

On the menu, there is also a small selection of seafood, and poultry, and other appetizers as well. When a restaurant does not have a huge menu, as Steakhouse 10 does not, that means they only cook a few dishes, but they cook those dishes to perfection! Steakhouse 10 does just that!


I don&#39;t know what else to say, except Steakhouse 10 does it to perfection!

When you think of all the high-end steak places in town (and we all know which ones I&#39;m talking about, here) they don&#39;t hold a candle to Steakhouse 10 for quality, service, and cuts of beef. The filet melts in your mouth. Melts. There are no sad cows to be found in this locale. Also, when setting foot in the restaurant, it&#39;s like being transported to a scene from the Goodfellas (minus the guns and back alley deals, of course - at least that we know of!) The attention to service is phenomenal, and the complimentary shots of licorice liquor are fabulous - this is coming from someone who hates both shots AND licorice. 

If you&#39;re gonna spend money on a good steak, spend it here where they take you as you are and serve you like royalty. 

Ask for George as a server - he&#39;s gracious and knows chivalry and is just fabulous on all counts. Good man."

My wife and I came in casually dressed.(mostly because I don&#39;t feel the need to impress an establishment that I intend on giving $200 for diner).  She looked down her nose at me when I ordered and old fashion and seemed annoyed when I asked her if she made a good one.   She said &#34;well we don&#39;t have bitters but I make a great old fashion&#34;.  She returned a few minutes later with a Sprite with a cherry and slice of orange in it and walked away.  My wife ordered a whiskey lemonade that was weak and overfilled with lemonade.(for the record I have had better drinks poured with more curtsey at a frat party in college.)
I wouldn&#39;t let this bartender serve drinks off a food truck much less a fine dining establishment.   She made us feel like she was doing us a favor and we weren&#39;t welcome at her bar.

The good: 
The waitress at our table was pleasant and informed.  The appetizers were fantastic and our steak and salmon diner was great.  We decided to order bottled beer which was fine Guinness to be expected. 

Overall We enjoyed the food but I felt that for an expensive restaurant the coctails options were weak.  If you want a glass of beer or a bottle of wine you are fine but if you are looking for comprehensive fine dining I would look elsewhere."

Upon entering you&#39;ll notice the dimly lit feel you tend to have walking into a high end steakhouse. 

For food, I chose to order the 24oz bone in Rib-eye. The meat, I want the meat. At medium rare they definitely know what they&#39;re doing. The order came with asparagus and a baked potato (you have a choice on this one between options) on top of the bottle of wine it was a fantastic experience. 

My friend and his mom both ordered the filet and although I didn&#39;t try it, they were both really really happy with their order.

Although for this review I gave 3 stars, it is almost certain we will be back. If you haven&#39;t been here it is well worth trying!
That being said... the last few times we have been there the service has been a bit lack luster, and thus the 3 stars. Mostly things you wouldn&#39;t notice at an applebees or outback, but at $40-$50 a steak, you should be able to expect good service which goes far beyond a free shot of ouzo.
Most recently our waiter looked a bit disheveled and tired, and this carried through to his work...
He looked at me as if I was crazy for ordering a beer as cocktail before dinner, then seemed reluctant to offer another even as my empty glass sat front and center before me in an attempt to get his attention. No &#34;umpf!&#34; in his ompa! and he almost set himself on fire. Although it was kind of funny, it reminded me of how tired he must be.
Watching other tables and the way their servers were dynamically and energetically presenting to their tables reminded me how much I had enjoyed the service here on previous visits.
Dinners like this I almost always enjoy a cup (or 3!) of coffee afterword, and it just irks the hell out of me when the waiter assumes he is done with your table and never bothers to come by after dessert hits the table. We don&#39;t linger like a bunch of old lady&#39;s showing pictures of their grand kids and demanding hot water for tea they brought themselves... 
The total for our table of 8 was well over $1000, properly finishing out the service was more than warranted.
There were other minor flaws in the service not worthy of mention, and the mash potatoes are nothing special.
On the up-side; Hard for a cheap ass like me to say that $40-$50 a steak is a bargain, but given that Steakhouse 10 is not ala carte and they dont nickel and dime you for the sides makes it an outstanding bargain for a great meal!
Seems like the service isn&#39;t as good while dining upstairs, so keep that in mind when making reservations."

I ordered the small filet and had it oscar style and he ordered the 10 oz, the steaks were seasoned and cooked to perfection and even delicious when I had my leftover the next day! Unfortunately we were too full to enjoy desert! 

Shannon waited on us and the service was fantastic! 

Thank you Steakhouse 10 for a memorable Valentines Day! I will definitely be back!"

It&#39;s  behind the Discount Tire off of Hampden in Englewood. First time in my life I had &#34;saganaki&#34; which is a flaming cheese dish. The workers there are top notch and Shannon was our waitress. The filet mignons is worth the wait time.

Great energetic staff - everyone from the greeter to the busboys. Our server, Jaimie, was sensational. She made great recommendations and was extremely attentive to all her tables. The food quality was also out of this world. Lamb chops, ribeye and Gangsta steak (East side) were delicious.  Highly recommended if you want to celebrate any special occasion."

Came here with a good friend that raved about the atmosphere - despite being told its not what it seems given the neighborhood or surroundings it was a pleasant surprise to walk Into a tucked away New York feel bistro with a strong family touch. Rarely do you see family run restaurants anymore and what made my first impression exceedingly pleasant was the host stating - &#34; hello welcome welcome MY brother will be right back to get you seated&#34;. I was sold on the atmosphere right then and there. The waitress was lively and non intrusive, the host pulled out my chair, took my coat etc. They knew how to make us feel valued / welcomed. 
 
The Sanagaki is a must try. Its cheese on fire right at your table. Yes please. 

Will be coming back to try the steaks :)"

Just got into Denver and clueless about the area. Yelped steakhouse since we were dying for a good meal.   Found the reviews for this place so called ahead in case we needed reservations.   The gentleman was very accommodating and managed to get us in within 30 min.  Well, we didn&#39;t realize we were like 10 minutes away so figured we&#39;d wait in the bar.  When we walked in he immediately knew who I was and seated us promptly.  Nice little table in a gently lit room with nice standards music playing in the background.   The waitress came and greeted us immediately and the assistant brought us water with lemon.  We ordered drinks and the sagayaki appetizer.  Everything was just so prompt and the assistant bent over backwards to make sure everything was cleaned up and we had what we needed.  The appetizer was fun with the flaming and she brought us 2 shots of ouzo, complimentary of course.  We both had the NY steak special with blue cheese, bacon and the wine reduction. YummO!!  We asked that they be medium-rare and they were spot on and Fantastic!!!!  To top it off, she brought more ouzo and two desserts.  We ordered the creme brûlée but she brought the lemon creme cake too as we were struggling to decide between the two.  Comped the lemon creme too.  Great dining experience memories as I lay here stuffed and miserable, but in a good way."

Hampden side of town and in-between a taco bell and a discount tire. But once you get inside it has the feel of a NY steakhouse. There were a few weird things like when the maitre&#39;d went to take us to our table, he literally ran into me instead of going around me and then didn&#39;t even acknowledge it. He then sat the rest of our party - who he knew we were waiting for and who checked in under the same name - at a separate table on the other side of the restaurant (So that&#39;s one star down for initial service). We waited a good 30 minutes for the rest of our party, only to find they had been waiting on us too.

The second star is lost to the dry, over-cooked piece of halibut that we payed $40 for. I didn&#39;t complain, so whatever. And the $15 dollar charge to split a plate seemed a bit hefty. My mother and father-in-law always share a dinner because portions are too large for them. I understand an up-charge, but that price seems high to me. Overall, it was A-ok as 3 stars says. My food is the only dish that seemed sub-par from what I could see. We enjoyed a family dinner and the service was good. But for the money, there are better places in the area."

The first time we went here, we were astonished on how amazing the service was, how fun it was, and how classy it was as well. The food is awesome, and the moscato is my favorite as my husband can agree. We left a little bit in a haze (if you know what I mean), so make sure you order lyft or uber when you go so you don&#39;t DUI an awesome night. 

The second and third time were as awesome as the first. What was even better was that on our third visit, my husband and I had a 9:20 reservation on a Monday night and were super worried they would rush us out since they close at 10. Nope! Not at all!! Awesome service every time!! Love this place! 

Food wise, we have had the escargot and the flaming cheese, and they are both amazing. The cheese is a fun service process, but the escargot is personally my favorite appetizer. It&#39;s garlicky and light. They give you bread ( with their amazing butter) and you get salad or soup with your entree. I opt for the lobster bisque, which is a little bit cinnamon and nutmeggy, while my husband opts for the salad with exceptional blue cheese dressing! I have had their steak and chicken Oscar, and I love it!!! My husband usually gets the gangster, and is always too full. This place is worth every penny!!!!!"

I got a petit filet and I think my gf got a prime rib. We both agreed it was nothing special. For a $40 steak I would&#39;ve been much happier going to Shanahan&#39;s. The meat just tasted like chargrilled meat and That Is It. No flavor whatsoever. vlGlad I went cuase I always like trying something new, and at least I know I can scratch this one off my list."

We didn&#39;t go with the Flaming Cheese, but had the peppercorn steak and the pork chop. Ordered medium on both and each came out perfectly to temp. 

Server staff was top-notch.  They noticed my birthday on the ID and tastefully offered a couple shots of Ouzo and a succulent chocolate cake.

My husband is a big meat guy and being from Chicago has pretty high Regards for a well cooked steak. 
He loved his steak. I&#39;m not a steak eater so I  ordered the chicken worth crab lumps on top and it was fine. Probably would not order it again. The saganaki appetizer was tasty. ( I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever had bad flaming cheese before though!) 
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back. Id like to try the seafood dishes, but understand that the real goodies are the steaks."

Not sure how people compare this place to the A list steakhouses in town but better from a pricing standpoint.  I don&#39;t get it.  The steak is priced pretty identically to Shanahan&#39;s, Del Frisco&#39;s, Morton&#39;s, Elway&#39;s etc but the steak doesn&#39;t come close to matching any steak I&#39;ve had at any of those places.  I had a 10 oz filet oscar style for $63 (49 plus 14 for oscar).  The whole thing was below average.  Granted you get a cup of soup and a potato side with it but it&#39;s simply not worth it and I don&#39;t get the hype.  Service was very friendly but my wife&#39;s potato showed up on my plate and vice versa.  My wife&#39;s steak wasn&#39;t any better.  I don&#39;t know how else to put it---I just don&#39;t get the 4 and 5 star reviews on here."

The server promptly greeted us and explained the restaurant&#39;s philosophy of service as a locally-owned establishment and not &#34;one of those corporate guys.&#34; This meant that the entree prices were inclusive, not a la carte. A soup/salad starter was followed by the entree with seasonal grilled vegetables and a massive dressed-up baked potato (or mashed if you prefer). My wife asked to substitute the potato with wild rice, which they had no problem with.

The filet oscar was fantastic - a delicious 7 ounce cut cooked perfectly and topped with buttered crab meat and drizzled with a hollandaise-ish cream sauce. The server&#39;s recommended pinot noir wine pairing couldn&#39;t have been a better choice.

The bone-in pork chop was at least 2 inches thick, and very flavorful.

The establishment&#39;s specialty is a tableside-flambeed Greek cheese, served with plenty of their delicious bread as an appetizer. Delicious.

We will be returning."

The best thing was the flaming cheese appetizer. The lobster bisque had good flavor but zero lobster or lobster flavor. I ordered the pepper steak and it was no real steak greatness covered in a heavy brown gravy that seemed like a prepackaged gravy from the shelf. The mashed potatoes were ok.  I ordered a martini that in the menu said $7 but when the bill came said $12.... We will not be back anytime soon. The service was friendly but the food was so lacking. We would have been beyond thrilled at Del Frisco&#39;s for only a few bucks more.

The bread had been sitting out too long and therefore was a bit stale around the edges.  The quality of the steak (New York Strip) I ordered was mediocre.  The lobster bisque was underwhelming.  The Filet was decent.  The baked potato had a bit of an aftertaste from the pan it was cooked in.  There are better places in the metro to have a steak.  It was by no means awful, just an average experience.  The service was 4 stars."

If you saw my belly, you would know during those weekdays I&#39;m on a worktrip, I eat well. About one night per week, I try out a steak house. Steakhouse 10 is number one in my book.
    My first time, I was with the CEO of my company, we called on our way and they got us in even though they were busy. The waiter was funny, friendly and super accommodating and the bone in Ribeye is not only a picture I keep on my phone for bragging rights, but was exactly how I would expect a ribeye to taste. I was noticing someone complaining about price, and I am wondering where they normally go. &#34;sizzler&#34; lol
    My second time coming was just 3 weeks later. I showed up alone, and they remembered me. They got me a great table and treated me like a king. My third and final time (till tomorrow when I fly to denver) was just as amazing. I met another friend who is from texas that agreed Steakhouse 10 is one of the best if not the best steakhouses we&#39;ve ever visited!"

The prices are a bit steep but the experience was worth it.  The atmosphere in the place was really neat.  The lower floor has a modern look to it.  The upper floor had a godfather feel to it!  The dark wood on the walls and bar combined with the soft lighting made the place.  Although it has two floors it&#39;s kind of small but I think it adds to the experience.  

I had a New York strip that ran about $50 and my wife had the filet mignon which was about the same.  It was a nice thick cut and was very juicy! One of the best steaks I&#39;ve eaten!  We had the flaming cheese for an appetizer.  It was also delicious.  It&#39;s a type of white cheese that&#39;s briefly set on fire with butter or oil.  Their bread was great.  We both had reds of course.  I had the Meiomi which went great with the steak and had a robust, fruity taste without being too sweet.  They even treated us to a shot of Ouzo!  Great find!!!"

The bartender was very friendly as were some of the other patrons around the bar. The venue is an unassuming structure tucked behind a Taco Bell (or some other drive thru that I suddenly can&#39;t recall). However inside is very cozy and some parts romantic. Prices are a tad high but I think that translates to the quality of the ingredients. My only complaint: the lobster bisque was very salty and lacked big chunks of seafood. Aside from that, I&#39;d be a regular if I lived in the area and had too much money to burn on dinners."

Thanks to the previous reviewers, it was great.  Requested a table upstairs, I opted for the salad rather than the lobster bisque (hubby had it-tasty, but no lobster).  We did get there at 5pm, so we had the entire floor to ourselves for half the meal, as well as the upstairs waiter/bartender.  Great service, loved the dark, warm, very old world European ambiance.  The rather low ceiling and a center fireplace adds to the coziness. 

I had the 7oz fillet (Oscar style) cooked to a perfect medium rare (warm red center) and a fluffy baked potato with a beautiful, generous dollop of whipped butter and sour cream on top.  Served with some grilled asparagus - nice body and good grill flavor.  Previous commentary has mentioned that the steak is &#34;under-seasoned&#34;.  I disagree.  There is a current school of thought that says you need to salt the bejeezus out of beef to &#34;bring out the flavor&#34; - that is not the concept here.  The steak was flavorful and balanced without relying on a high salt coating.  

This is now one of my top choices - although Shanahan&#39;s remains #1."

But I was pleasantly surprised! 

As soon as you walk in you feel you&#39;ve entered fine dining. During the busy lunch crowd, the owner greeted us at the door and instructed our server to seat us. We were taken upstairs to a dining room that I could only describe as a....a windmill owned by the Mob turned into a secret restaurant...they&#39;ve got to have Mama cooking in a closet somewhere ;)

But seriously..everything was warm, inviting, and delicious. Our server was attentive and friendly. And our food came out super fast. 

The menu is very small but surprisingly eclectic: Burgers, sandwiches, Greek, Mexican, and even a few Asian Salads.

I ordered the Side Greek Salad that was the size of a dinner salad! And it was probably the best Greek salad I have EVER eaten.

And the Ten Burger with fries: 1/2 lb. charbroiled, smothered with sautéed mushrooms and onions, swiss and american cheese on a toasted bun. Which was large enough to share.

I will definitely be returning on my next trip to Denver.

After visiting some other steakhouses and being disappointed, we decided to go back to the one place we always had a great meal and service. We were not let down, and had a marvelous experience. In fact, we had probably the best service ever at any restaurant anywhere. My wife was feeling a bit warm, and our server, Shannon, noticed. Without asking or any advance notice, Shannon brought my wife an ice bag. The great service did not end there. Throughout the evening she went out of her way to please . The bus service was, as always, right on, with water and drinks refilled and dirty plates removed on queue and without having to ask. There simply is no better place for overall value and service.

I have to say we all ordered different entrees and the food was fabulous. The service was absolutely superb. The waiter kept our water glasses full and Jamie (spelling ) was our server and she was incredible. I gave you 5 stars but you should go from 1-10. You would get a 10. Thank You so much for an enjoyable dining experience.

I visited Steakhouse 10 last night for the first time, and was disappointed in myself that I didn&#39;t even know it was there. Holy cow, I&#39;ve been missing out!! There were 6 of us for dinner, and we were all very happy with our food and drink choices (I recommend the lamb!). The wine list is extensive and includes some great finds. The ceasar salad was very tasty, but those of us who had the lobster bisque had the same complaint as another reviewer -- it&#39;s lacking in chunks of seafood and lobster that one would expect. Also, as another reviewer stated, it&#39;s a small place, and loud tables can really have a negative impact on the experience -- we had such a table right next to us, and it made conversation VERY difficult as we were loudly bombarded with talk of Netflix and Apple TV. :( While this is certainly not a direct reflection on the restaurant, it&#39;s something to keep in mind if you&#39;re looking for a quiet dinner. Perhaps ask to be seated upstairs, which seemed to be much quieter.

The only reason I didn&#39;t award 5 stars was because of a rather serious glitch in the service. While our waitress was very friendly and attentive throughout our meal, she committed a huge faux pas at the end of our service by bringing shots of liquor to everyone at the table. Two of our group had specifically ordered non-alcoholic beer as they are recovering alcoholics (albeit, long-time recoverers, which is why they drink NA beer). When people order things like NA beer, you don&#39;t put shots of liquor in front of them, complimentary or not. The thought was nice, but there wasn&#39;t much &#34;thought&#34; involved there, if you know what I mean. Overall, I&#39;ll definitely return. This is one of the better steakhouses in Denver, for sure."

The service was 5 star, the food was 5 star, and the ambience was very nice. It was expensive but in this case, we paid for what we got, which was a 5 star, very memorable, enjoyable dining experience. I had the 7oz filet minon with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and salad all of which I would highly recommend. The lemon in the water was a nice touch, and the chocolate mousse cake and cheese cake for dessert were both excellent. Can&#39;t afford to come here as often as I&#39;d like, but for special occasions, will definitely be back :)"

Steaks (I am a ribeye fanatic) cooked exactly as ordered, great sides, martinis that are expertly prepared, and a very well selected wine list.

Safanaki is a must. Hell I could have eaten two of them. Cesar salad. Spot on. Two steaks and salmon and everything was perfect. Béarnaise is fresh, thick and wonderful. 

Never a glass went empty or a plate left dirty. 

Ouzo when we sat down and even a NA version for my daughter.

We all ordered different meals, and tried each other&#39;s food, the peppercorn cream sauce was a favorite for all of us! It was spicy and delicious in every way, it added the perfect &#34;kick&#34; to the steak. 

The desserts were great too! The Creme Brulee is very traditional, and yummy. The little fried tortilla cheesecake things (forgot the name) were delicious too!

So I hate giving five stars because it becomes valueless, however it&#39;s not as good as Elways, but it definitely decimates Morton&#39;s and murders Del Friscos.

If you like steak, you have to come here.

Also they literally have the best lobster bisque on the planet!"

I ordered the 7 oz filet, which came with a soup or salad, asparagus, &amp; mashed potatoes. All for 39 dollars. That&#39;s a great deal! I work at &#34;one of those corporate steakhouses&#34; where the sides &amp; salads are al a carte. However, the steak was not seasoned well. It was cooked to perfection! Still disappointing.

It&#39;s dark and romantic and classy and cozy all at the same time!

The service is incredible. I came with a few friends to celebrate a new job for one of them and I think that just about every server, host and bartender comes to your table to say hello and offer their help. No joke, about 7 people came and greeted us even after being seated, just to see how things were, if they could get us anything, just to introduce themselves and say hello. 

It sounds overbearing, but I promise, it isn&#39;t. It feels like you walked into the house of a beloved family friend and they are constantly offering you something to drink or something to eat. It&#39;s cozy and inviting. (If you&#39;ve seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding and loved it, you will feel right at home here, TRUST ME).

The service is top notch, although it should it be at a higher end steakhouse.

You can tell it&#39;s a family establishment, warm and inviting.  The steak is very good and the Ouzo shots are a great way to end a fantastic meal.  Everything was great, I really want to give 5 stars, but if I&#39;m going to get a really nice steak I prefer a dry age to a wet age.  It&#39;s just personal preference, the wet age was very tasty.

Cool spot, you should definitely go."

We were barely greeted at the front door, we were sat in 5 minutes and then we waited about 15 minutes before a server actually acted like they wanted to assist us. As we were waiting to be acknowledged we called another local favorite to see if they could seat us we were so turned off by being ignored by the servers and managing staff. The place was not that busy, and we had at least 5 people walk buy our table and look at us but not ask us if they could take our drink order. I truly feel that this steakhouse is great to visit if you are in the Greek Mob as the overall feel of the place was cold and unwelcoming. My husband and I both felt they did not appreciate gay people as patrons. The food was just average in my book, I think Denver has much better options for steak houses. The most memorable part of the evening and the meal was the Saganaki appetizer."

We love this family-owned, one-of-a-kind unique little spot so much -- and I emphasize unique!  (The reviewer who gave it 3 stars and said she had issues with other locations is confused -- there is only ONE Steakhouse 10!)  

The atmosphere is cozy, warm, upscale and just delightful.   The service is equally warm and accommodating -- we&#39;ve never had a bad experience.   We&#39;ve celebrated birthdays and upcoming weddings and this year, we are planning a family holiday dinner.  I love the Greek touches on the menu (and the drinks!) and I always, always, always get the escargot appetizer -- such a flavorful dish and especially if you love garlic and butter -- who doesn&#39;t?!   Of course, we always get steaks for our entree -- my favorite is the NY Strip.  It is always perfectly cooked and beyond delicious.  

The only downside we had recently was the noise level of one table nearby -- four guys and two women and none of them understood that the entire restaurant was not interested in their conversation.  it is a small place and we&#39;d not had that issue on prior visits so hopefully, that was just a one-time rarity.  We suffered through it since there was not an empty table in sight -- and even if there had been, this group was so loud we could have sat on the curb and still heard them!

Rude group of 6 aside, the food was spectacular as always and the service was equally so.  We&#39;d highly recommend Steakhouse 10 -- it&#39;s a cut above all the other same-old same-old steakhouses in Denver."

The saganaki and escargot were delicious.  We also enjoyed the lobster bisque while waiting for the main course.

My boyfriend said the filet ranked &#34;top 3&#34; of the best steak he&#39;d ever eaten... At least that&#39;s what I think he said.  I could barely hear him over mouthful after mouthful of deliciousness, named Gangster Steak.  The veggies and olives, I couldn&#39;t get enough.  Cooked to perfection.  I only wish I knew how to master the veggies... And sauce!  *insert drool emoji*  I&#39;m not a big steak eater, but I definitely was that night.  What a wonderful experience.

On a Friday night without a reservation we wondered into Steakhouse 10 with only other Yelp reviews setting the expectation. We were greeted by every staff member that passed, making sure we were taken care of. The host advised that we would only have a 15 minute wait &amp; invited us to sit at the bar. We each ordered a drink which were excellent and allowed us a little extra time to review the menu (I&#39;m one of those annoying people who has to read the whole menu before making a decision). 

Exactly 15 minutes later we were called for our table. Were were taken to a lovely table upstairs and immediately approached by our waitress. She got our wine &amp; appetizer order. The Saganaki is by far the BEST I&#39;ve ever had - especially when eaten with their amazing bread (I could live off that bread). We then ordered steaks ; I had the 7oz. fillet &amp; my fiance had the ribeye. All the food was amazing - ooh the lobster bisque; a must have!!

I must add that I worked in the service industry years ago which makes me a pretty big skeptic (maybe a little over critical at times) - which makes what I&#39;m about to add pretty amazing...

My family and I had a moment of blindness as the host led us to our table. It is dim inside, but after awhile, eyes adjust (thankfully).

Service here is SO attentive. A host makes sure the water cups are always topped off and provides refills of the warm, comforting bread whenever necessary.

Our server was even more awesome. He introduced himself, told us about the specials, and made sure we got what we needed with our entrees. He was great with recommending red wine for us: despite his lean towards California wine, he was satisfied with our South American pick.

Now usually, I am under the impression that &#34;nicer&#34; restaurants = small portions for the price. Not so! Steakhouse 10 had more than enough bread, soup, salad to keep our bellies warm until we got our entrees....

And, the entrees were superb. I went with the steak medallions, and luckily so! If I had ordered a sirloin, ribeye, etc, I would have been bursting to the seams.

Couldn&#39;t resist the dessert either: creme brulee, mmmm. Our server told us how the restaurant is Greek-owned and my sister pulled a fast one on him by speaking some simple Greek. Poor guy was embarrassed to admit he himself didn&#39;t know any of the Greek language...

Upstairs has a swankier atmosphere with The Alibi Room: kind of like a lounge, but seems like it is reserved for special parties. If you come to Steakhouse 10, most likely you&#39;ll get to peek at the Alibi Room since the restrooms are located upstairs.

The food is consistent and CHEAP. If it was just a food rating, I&#39;d give it 4 stars, but the value is excellent compared to other bbq joints in the Aurora/Denver area. At $6, the pulled pork sandwich is one of the best values for lunch I can think of. Service is quick and it&#39;s around the corner from my house. I come here frequently now.

They have been at this spot for awhile and when i had to drop off my car at the Firestone during lunch time, so i had to try some bbq.

There was one guy who just finished ordering and i started to order mine to the cashier in question.  This lady was mid 20s and she stared at with no response at all.  There was some commotion going on behind her and she was totally captivated by the conversation or whatever.

Food might taste out of this world but when we cant even place order, ...

Good luck with your business model.

Just another let down. We each order the pork sandwich. So far only 3 bites has been taken out of one sandwich. $6 each and they taste like Lloyds BBQ in the tubs at the grocery store.

I ordered the Belly Buster sandwich and some catfish. I love catfish and have yet to find a place that has great catfish. Well, I found it! The catfish was perfectly hot and tender, not over fried. The sandwich was good too. The hot link was great, but honestly the brisket was bland and BBQ sauce was too. 
So I&#39;ll be going back if I&#39;m ever hungering for some good catfish or hot links.

My husband and I had heard about this BBQ food truck on Mississippi &amp; Havana so we finally got the chance and stopped by to try it. 
We never even got past the rude &#34;female&#34; (if will you will) that you have to place your order with.  I say female because she was far from a &#34;lady&#34; and far from having any customer service skills. 
I don&#39;t know about you guys  but I do know I work too hard for my money to have someone so hateful and rude and apparently angry at the world take it from me with an attitude when I did nothing to Warrant it. At that point it had killed any desire to even try the food and we both  got in the car and left.
It must be exhausting to be so angry, bitter and hateful?.

You know those mountains that Colorado is sort of famous for? They feel like they are hours away. It&#39;s tough. It&#39;s really tough. But you know what? Some famous guy once said something about clouds and silver linens (or, you know, something like that). I don&#39;t know why clouds would even need linens (they&#39;re just so billowy), but I think what that famous guy meant was that people who seem to have no choice but to move out to &#34;Might As Well Be Kansas&#34; actually are rewarded with a cornucopia of culinary deliciousness. Without a doubt, Golden Saigon is at the very heart of that cornucopia. 

A number of years ago, I mourned the loss of an old dear friend, Vietnam Grill. This was, at the time, and to the best of my knowledge, the single greatest Vietnamese restaurant in Denver. For several years I traveled up and down Federal trying to find a worthy replacement - each time coming back empty-handed. Nothing could measure up. Nothing, that is, until I made the terrific life decision to try an un-assuming little restaurant in a dilapidated Aurora strip mall. That day... well... it was magic. 

I walked into Golden Saigon and thought to myself, something is different here. The wood paneling and general darkness make the interior feel like an old-time steakhouse. The decor does, of course, also involve a fish tank and some tourism posters, but the tall booths and the ambiance created just feel different. What really sets Golden Saigon apart, though, is the food. I&#39;m not certain whether I should even try to describe it. Words cannot do justice... On my first visit our server recommended, &#34;One of our curries, trust me, you&#39;ll be glad you did.&#34; Not surprisingly, he was right. I had the Lamb in Coconut Milk dish and was blown away. It is practically a perfect dish. Better yet is that all entrees come with a complimentary cup of a delightful asparagus crab soup - which is amazing. 

Since my first visit I have been repeatedly marching through that front door accompanied by friends, family, and anybody else who has yet to hear the good news. The King is Dead. The King is Dead. Long Live the King."

I ventured to try the lemon grass tofu today and I wasn&#39;t happy with my order. The veggies were undercooked. The green beans and the brussel sprouts were practically raw. However, I do like the variety of veggies that come with the dish. Everything from bok choi, asparsgus, zucchini, bell pepper, green beans, and onions. Also, the dish is marked as spicy, but it wasn&#39;t spicy at all. More salty if anything.

We also ordered the combination pho, beef pho, and Vietnamese egg rolls. The egg rolls were delicious as always. My mom was disappointed with the combination pho. It was primarily beef and brisket. She was hoping for tripe, tendons, and more meatball. Very Americanized pho."

sat down, waited good 5 minutes or more before the owner&#39;s daughter (?) came by with water.  I expressed lack of time during the limited lunch hours and she rebutted with how short of help she has, in a way that was rude.

1.  service: very slow.  avoid this place during lunch hours if you have limited time.
2.  pho: was very good.  great broth.  noodle was bit off.

I stumbled upon this place looking for a Vietnamese restaurant to take my mom out whom was visiting from out of town. It had great reviews, so I figured, hey, let&#39;s try it and I&#39;m very glad I did! 

The food is great! I have tried many of the dishes on their menu and have consistently enjoyed them. Their dumplings, egg rolls, and wontons are all great ways to start your meal and if you are lucky, they will sometimes surprise you with a free appetizer.

As for entrees, I honestly do not believe you can go wrong with anything this place has to offer. I want to highlight their curry and lamb in coconut milk (which also has curry). This is probably one of their better options and is absolutely delicious. They are creamy and flavorful, but not too overwhelming with the spices. The traditional style fish has beautiful presentation, strong flavors, and will not disappoint! Every time I came here I enjoyed different entrees and while I&#39;m happy to highlight a few of my favorites, I don&#39;t think anything on the menu will disappoint you.

They also offer delicious desserts. They typically either have a three chocolate moose which is very rich or moose bars (which flavors rotate based on the day). On special events, you may get something else. I was fortunate enough to come in on Valentine&#39;s day and they offered cupcakes with chocolate strawberries on top. One had a nilla wafer icing and the other had an oreo icing, but both were amazing!

I want to offer a special shoutout to Tao (sp?), whom is both a server and prepares food there. She has a wonderful personality and always makes my experience special. If they run out of something, she always is sure to let you know and will go out of her way to make it up to you even if you are okay with it. She&#39;s made me some homemade sodas which were absolutely delicious and has even made me some delicious mixed drinks using those sodas! I recommended it to her one time and she thought it was a good idea. When she came back, I reiterated how great alcohol would be in it and she looked shocked and asked &#34;can you not taste the alcohol?&#34; Let me tell you, I could not and that drink was absolutely delicious!"

I think great surprises are like a hit of caffeine: They jolt you awake. They make life just a little bit more thrilling and bring an immediate smile to your face . . . you know . . . like the best kind of drug.

And speaking of drugs, the Golden Saigon serves up my favorite one. Food. No matter what I say about quitting and going cold turkey (uh, so to speak;-), I always find myself wanting more and more.

So the GS is now my main-man dealer.  Got served by the grand(?)son of the owner whose name I think was Twan. He is a sterling, open, kind, generous sort. As first timers, he supplemented what we selected. Ordered 2 of their incredible asparagus and crab soups; he brought 4. Ordered the wonderful Vietnamese fried egg rolls; he also brought a version of them steamed. In addition we had the spectacular soft shelled crab, fried dumplings and do it yourself eggrolls with shrimp, beef and chicken. 

If it sounds like we were a party of 8 we weren&#39;t. There were my wife and I (and I&#39;m on a supposed diet) and my in-laws who are in their 80s and don&#39;t usually eat more than what would satisfy a small bird. If you&#39;ve ever been to GS you&#39;d understand that the amount of the food we got and then took home as left-overs was enough to feed my sweetheart and me for the rest of the week. Bottom line: the portions are enormous and the food is as fresh as I&#39;ve seen served anywhere.

Amazing.

Cheap as can be.

Perfect experience.

And outrageously fun.

Clearly Golden Saigon has been in business a few decades for a reason! They have pet fish in the aquarium older than most restaurants in Denver.

Highlights included house-made, LARGE crab cheese rangoons, wonton soup with whole, fresh veggies, and some of the BEST pork fried rice in town. Tsing Tao to wash it down... our dinner was delicious. 

But what made our visit 5 stars was the impeccable service. We were seated immediately and everything came out quickly. Twan went above and beyond, bringing us spring rolls on the house, an improvised soup for our toddler, and when my hubbie whined that they didn&#39;t have a dessert menu, he brought us fresh Logan fruit from the back from his own private stash. All these yummy extras were unprompted - just a restaurant proprietor that wants his customers happy.

This evening reminded me that excellent food is a must, but to really have a divine dining experience a patron should feel paid attention to, and we definitely did."

I&#39;ve been coming to Golden Saigon for nearly ten years, and the quality of their food and service hasn&#39;t changed one bit.

As far as food goes, I think they get the golden trophy for their sesame tofu. It&#39;s served hot and crispy over a bed of styrofoam (fried rice noodles) and rice. I usually ask for the dish spicy and crispy with broccoli.

I recently had the lemongrass tofu with steamed tofu and thoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe it was exactly what I wanted at the time (it was), but the veggies with the soft tofu and the sauce just mm. The dish was bursting with flavor. Steamed tofu is a good choice for when you&#39;re not feeling the fried stuffs.

If you&#39;re going to get the sesame chicken, ask for it spicy and crispy, and they&#39;ll season it differently... Better than how it&#39;s normally served.

The pho here is one of the best. Their broth is extremely clean compared to other pho restaurants. They also don&#39;t skimp out on the protein. They do not serve any vegetarian phos though, sadly.

The fried rice is very flavorful here, but be sure to ask for it with an egg on top. It&#39;ll really bring the whole dish together and add that extra flare. But, the dish is still good without the egg. I just like eggs in my fried rice.

So, in short, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that this place rocks in every way possible. Yeah, they&#39;re awesome."

I ordered a vietnamese coffee.  I know it takes a while to make, which is why I always order it first at Vietnamese restaurants.

Only 2 other tables when we arrived but it got busy after we ordered. The menu offers a full array of Vietnamese offerings other than Pho and noodle bowls which seems hard to come by so I was pretty excited. We ordered Vietnamese eggrolls, sweet and sour shrimp, and lemongrass beef. Egg rolls came with only 2 pieces of lettuce so we had to ask twice for more before receiving. The gnoc mam was super sweet and not as balanced as I prefer so I doctored it up with siracha and lime. Hubs sweet and sour shrimp came right away just after egg rolls were delivered. The shrimp are huge and perfectly fried to a heavenly golden perfection. The lemongrass beef however took forever to arrive. We had to ask about it twice before it showed up.  Apparently they forgot to put the order in and it was rushed to be made. When it came it was pretty much inedible because of the overuse of black pepper. Seriously like it got accidentally spilled in and they decided to serve it anyway. Somewhere before that came and after Hubs shrimp entree we got the Krab soup that was supposed to come with the meal. It was just OK, an egg drop soup with imitation krab, not life changing like other reviewers proclaimed.  Anyhow the waitress felt bad and brought complementary Thai tea. Not our fav but nice gesture. Since we didn&#39;t drink much if it she also brought out some mango cake that was really good and comped the beef dish. Did i mention the flys... Shut the door during service, it&#39;s a restaurant, it&#39;s summer time, I don&#39;t want to feel under attack from bugs and protect my food while I&#39;m eating.  As for first impressions it wasn&#39;t a good experience at all. I think they made a valiant effort to make up for the short comings but idk if we&#39;ll ever return. 2 stars for the shrimp and effort to correct instead of just 1."
golden-saigon-aurora,Amanda G.,vRdASDBeRdr7-fz0K9FjLg,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,66,233,pO38TNyiFlax6vdNdamNKw,4.0,2016-04-14,"A little more than eight years ago, I fell in love with a man who, to my chagrin, was quite the ethnic foodie virgin. Sure, he&#39;d had Tex-Mex and Americanized Chinese, but the Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, Afghani, and true Mexican street tacos I introduced him to were new frontiers. Fast forward to now, and I can&#39;t keep him away from the damn stuff. Our go-to comfort foods are spicy curries and steaming bowls of pho and petite corn tortillas folded around cilantro and onion and perfectly-braised, perfectly-seasoned lengua. 

So when E recommended we try a new Vietnamese restaurant the other night, I wasn&#39;t surprised. I was proud! We hopped in the car and were at Golden Saigon in no time. It&#39;s an unassuming place, tucked in a strip mall hiding diagonally across the intersection from H-Mart. We slid into a booth and took stock of the menu. Waters were quickly brought, and we got away to ordering. Meatball pho for E and a chicken rice noodle bowl for me. The entree also came with a soup, and I selected the asparagus with crab.

First, I&#39;ve got to give a hand to the service. There were two waiters working that evening and both were phenomenal. They were sweet and efficient and very attentive. Not only were the waters quick to arrive but orders were placed very quickly, which is good because we were hungry!!

My soup and E&#39;s spring rolls arrived very quickly. The soup was really tasty, but was a much different consistency than I was expecting...instead of the broth I thought it would be, it was similar to egg drop soup and very thick. That texture is always very off putting to me, but it had really good flavor! The spring rolls were very good as well, with tons of veggies, huge shrimp, and strips of grilled chicken.

Entrees were huge. E&#39;s pho was run-of-the-mill but he enjoyed it. I loved my noodle bowl. It came with plenty of noodles, grilled chicken, veggies, and two mini egg rolls, which tasted like they had some mushrooms in them and were very tasty.

In the middle of the meal, we were presented with two huge mugs of fresh jasmine tea. We didn&#39;t ask for them, but they were accepted with no questions asked!!! I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a normal thing to get free tea in the middle of your meal, but I was pretty tickled either way. It smelled just like all the spring blossoms popping up around the city, and tasted just as lovely!

We each boxed up half of our meals for lunch the next day, and our waiter was nice enough to transfer E&#39;s pho so he didn&#39;t spill it all over the table! Then we got little squares of strawberry cake with our bill. Again, not sure if that&#39;s normal but I thought it was a nice touch!

Overall, the meal was VERY well priced considering we had so much food, plus we loved the service and really liked the food. We will most definitely be back!"

1. Thank you Yelp for suggesting Golden Saigon when I searched for pho places in Aurora.

2. Thank you Golden Saigon for being so damn amazing!

From the looks of the place outside, you would think it would be kind of a shit hole. But then you walk inside and see how beautiful it is.  I would really think it was a nice steakhouse if I only saw the inside and didn&#39;t know what kind of food they served. We were greeted and seated in a booth.  Other people came in after us and were seated and ordered drinks. It did take a bit before we were greeted in our seats, but after that, the service was beyond phenomenal.  We started with some crab cheese wontons. Along with the wontons came an order of spring rolls on the house. The wontons were HUGE! And packed full! OMG they were fantastic. The spring rolls were flavored well.  Very tasty. As our meal we each got pho. That day they had a kobe beef pho available, so Brian had to get it.  I tried the rare beef pho, which is my fav. Both were excellent.  The broth was almost sweet.  This was different and a great change compared to most Vietnamese restaurants. Once we finished the pho, a server came by and asked how dinner was.  We kept raving about it.  He asked if it was our first time, and we replied yes.  Not even a minute later he was serving us strawberry shortcake and hot jasmine tea on the house.  The strawberry shortcake melted in your mouth and wasn&#39;t too sweet.  The tea was the perfect finish for the evening.  The whole meal really couldn&#39;t have gotten any better. We will be back. Many many many times!"

So this review is solely for their pick up service.

Service (2 stars)
They told me it would take 25 mins and I got there 30 mins after placing the order.  I told them I was there to pick up they did not ask me for my name and just told me to sit at the desk in the very front of the restaurant.  It was very awkward and I sat there for 10+ mins before I turned around and asked when my order would be ready.  That was when the lady reconfirmed my name and told me that my order has been ready!  

Food (3.5 stars)
Sesame chicken (3 stars)
This was highly recommended on yelp so we ordered it.  The chicken was too tough but the coating etc was great
Curry with tofu (4 stars)
Would&#39;ve given them 5 stars except for the fact that they forgot my tofu!  Highly recommend this dish but just make sure they put the right protein in... If they put any at all.
Chow fun with combination meat (4 stars)
It was okay I would recommend"

Ambiance: Interesting. French touches that make you smile,  but honestly wonder - &#34;Am in the right place? This is Vietnamese food, yes?&#34; (Remnants of colonial influence?) Whatever it is, I can dig it. It feels like family lives here. Also appreciate seeing a diverse customer base. 

Food: YES. It is apparent in all ways that they care about what they put on your plate. Let&#39;s get into it.
- Thai tea. Real tea, real spices, creamy, but not too sweet. A tasty intro.
- Crab and cheese wontons. Hot, crisp, cream cheese and surprise, mozzarella in there too. The sauce has got personality that doesn&#39;t come in a jar. We&#39;re starting to believe by this point.
- Beef pho. Ok, it&#39;s serious up in here. The aromatics sing to you in that broth, telling you a story of bones and tradition, steeped in care and know-how. These are healing waters. 
- Bonus: Kobe pho. Honor the animal, and don&#39;t overcook the meat. Your mouth will thank you. The hot broth is beauty in a bowl.
- Mango mousse cake. Lovely, light. Great outro to finish pleasing the palate.

Service: On point - friendly, knowledgeable, attentive. I heard our server asking after a customer&#39;s family on the way out. We told him we were from out of town, and he shared great info and suggestions on how to get the most out of our visit. Every time he spoke about the food, you could sense the pride that goes into presenting something done right. Thank you Thuan!

I chose Combination and it came with shrimp, white noodles, egg rolls in bite size pieces, and cold onions. It had some sort of beef and meat also but the main thing that killed it was the odor it out off from raw meat, fish and onions. It smelled very awful to the point where each bite wasn&#39;t very appetizing because the smell was too strong. I ended up not wanting to finish it and was pretty grossed out by the smell.

I have been here many times in small groups of 2 to 3 people and with big groups of 5-8 people, meaning they are good for any group size, and with kids. 

The outside doesn&#39;t do justice for the food they serve here. But it goes to show that you can&#39;t judge a book by its cover! 

Everything is delicious here! I usually get the spring roll platter with a combination of pork, beef and fried shrimp! The platter is huge and enough to feed 2 or 3 people, but on really hungry days I can eat it by myself! 

On this particular visit, I got the spring roll platter with all fried shrimp and my boyfriend got the combination fried rice! We were both very satisfied! We also got an order of crab cheese wontons, and a side order of egg drop soup. All of which was nothing but amazing. I wish I would have taken pictures, but I was so hungry I forgot! 

The customer service is exceptional! I can tell this is a small family owned business but the customer service puts the cherry on top! I have come here so much, that they know what I order! But that shows that they pay attention to their customers. I would very much recommend this place! It&#39;s a must try!"

The food and service are faultless.  Our last visit was July 6th, 2016, and look forward to going again soon.

  Thank you, Golden Saigon!"

This was one of the best dinning experiences I have ever had. The manager is just friendly, amazing and made some new customers!! The food portions are large, enough to box up and take home for the next night. The food was so good. The sweet and sour sauce is handmade and is so good you could literally drink it!! All the vegitables were fresh and crunchy, the mini cakes are fluffy and light. Service was excellent as well. You gotta try this place out!!"

The food is fantastic, and I don&#39;t just mean the Pho and the noodles.  My husband ordered the seafood salad last night, which turned out to be lettuce, cucumber, etc, piled high with a mountain of fresh, beautiful steamed shrimp, calimari, scallops, and mussels, topped with roasted brussel sprout leaves.  We have never been disappointed in anything we have ordered here, and for how great the food is, dinner for 2 is pretty easy on the wallet.  We also love the ambiance and vibe inside: casual, yet cozy and homey, and the white table cloths add just a touch of class.  The service is friendly and expedient-- you can tell the people that work there care about the business, the food, and the customers.  Also, added bonus: they have a full bar!

Their make your own spring roll platter is enough to fill three. Their sesame chicken has that nice crispiness that I can only get here. Their green curry is a very healthy portion and absolutely to die for. I like it with a bit of Sriracha.  If you haven&#39;t gone to try this amazing local restaurant, you must go ASAP!

We&#39;ve spent many a family birthday here and each time the service and the food is exquisite. For my father in law&#39;s 70th birthday today, he chose this restaurant as he does every year...and each year we rave and are always surprised and amazed at the creative, gorgeous dishes that are bursting with flavors. This year we tried the family meal. ($15.99 per person- minimum 2 people) Now dear yelp readers... the menu reads: Spring rolls, BBQ shrimp and Pork, Fish soup, and salted fish. 
What we got was something close to a flavor explosion and so much food we thought we would pop! The spring rolls- you guessed- spring rolls or in our case the Vietnamese crispy egg rolls-  always delightful! The &#34;BBQ dish&#34; was a surprising salad course with their charcoal grilled pork and fat juicy shrimps, the salad was a  delightful blend of greens, shredded fennel, pineapple, sliced cherry tomatoes, a few sneaky brussel sprouts that every (except me) fought over. I had NO IDEA pineapple and fennel were such a delicious pairing! The fish soup was served hot-pot style- large chunks of fish, shrimp, and other seafood. Citrusy, savory and spicy it was perfectly balanced. In a clay pot was served the salted fish which we were told is specialty...man was it ever. My husband may have had three helpings- but said if he had room he would have ate the whole thing. everything tonight as it is every time- was incredible. Thanks for another memorable evening Golden Saigon!"

i&#39;m a long time customer at Golden Saigon and over the years, I have enjoyed friendly staff and good, reasonably-priced food. But the quality of food seem to have nose-dived recently. The food are just not as good as they used to be, although given the price, maybe they are okay for what it is, that is, cheap Asian food.

But what appalls me most was how unfriendly and rude the staff have become. They seem to be way-understaffed so I understand that service can be a bit lacking. But no matter how understaffed and busy they may be, they shouldn&#39;t have rude and condescending attitude toward the very customers they are serving. But sadly, that seems to be the case. While one particular waitress was extremely rude and never fulfilled my order, I blame the management for letting the quality slip and running the restaurant understaffed as to make everyone miserable.

I don&#39;t plan to visit the Golden Saigon anytime soon and I would advise that if you must go, try to avoid busy time cuz they would really hate you for making them busy..."

She is one of those lucky people to have an allergy to it.  Anyway, I called Golden Saigon and asked that same question today.  The person on the other line cheerfully stated they never use MSG.  Of course I was hesitant, because other restaurants in town have said they dont use MSG, and we have found out in the past the hard way.  But one of our favorite things in the world to eat is PHO, so we carry on the quest.  I digress...We tried Golden Saigon today- the chicken PHO was fantastic!  We had a combo appetizer with egg rolls, soft shell crab, fried shrimp and beef wrapped shrimp (my new personal favorite), and everything was fabulous!  The place is family owned- Son runs the front of the house, while Mum and Dad master the kitchen.  You can tell they really care about the place and its customers.  They even brought us a free shrimp spring roll appetizer while we were waiting on our meal.  For anyone in the city looking for a great bowl of MSG free PHO, and great food overall, this is the place to go!  I highly recommend you seek out this gem immediately..."

I order to go from here on a weekly basis. I love that they occasionally throw in their hot and sour soup or dessert for free. 

Lets talk hot and sour soup. This place has the BEST hot and sour soup! mmmmm. Actually, I have yet to try any of their menu items that I don&#39;t like. This is my go to place for Pho. I live in Aurora, there&#39;s plenty of places to get pho, but this place has really tasty broth that makes the pho that much better than the other places. Sesame Tofu is another delicious choice as well. Don&#39;t let the location drive you away. It&#39;s in an odd location that is easily missed. Another yelper mentioned the old booths but none of that is important considering they have the two most important things that makes a successful restaurant: great service and great food."

Living on this side of town, I can&#39;t believe it took us this long to eat here. The food, the service, the atmosphere, the management (Tuan, son of the owners) were all fantastic!

We started with the grilled mussels, simply amazing! Served with a great sauce and grilled mint (who knew?). The chicken fried rice was made with turmeric which added a remarkable unique flavor. But our main course was the best...seafood hotpot! An incredible soup in which they didn&#39;t skimp on the seafood. FULL of shrimp, mussels, king crab legs, clams and fresh vegetables. Simply incredible and fresh! Not to mention that manager Tuan kept bringing us free food, like shrimp spring rolls and an amazing desert (I think it was some sort of mango cake topped with butterscotch). Tuan also thoroughly explained all the dishes and its ingredients and how all is made (NO restaurant nowadays does that!)...incredible service!

I can&#39;t even with this place. The pho? Amazing. The broth is perfection alone and the portions are beyond generous, and all extremely fresh, and for a really great price. I have never been able to finish anything other than a small pho there. 
Also? The crab Rangoon? Stop it with that. I don&#39;t know how they do it but they are easily the most delicious Rangoon of all Rangoons. So perfect. 
On top of that, they make a killer beef curry that is tender and perfectly flavorful, the broth is perfect alone or just, you know... Stored in a ziploc Baggie in your purse for later. Whatever. 
But you know what? The food isn&#39;t even the best part of this glorious shop of culinary wonder- the service. I love these guys. So polite, so happy to see you, always recognize their regulars with little desserts at the end of the meal and a few words before disappearing back into the kitchen aka the place where magic lives. 
I can&#39;t recommend this place enough, please go here and your life will be instantly better."

We were seated promptly and given the Menu.  We opt to be seated at one of the Booth.  It was on the Left Wing of this establishment.  There are several items in the Menu but we decide to order these following items.

*  Fried Shrimp ($6.95)
*  Crab Cheese Wontons ($5.95)
*  Beef Chow Fun aka Hu Tiu Xao ($8.95)
*  Lamb With Coconut Milk aka De Xao Lan ($12.95)
*  Hot Jasmine Tea ($1.75)

They sent the Fried Shrimp item and Crab Cheese Wontons.  Ok dishes.

The Fried Shrimp Item comes with all the trimmings.  It comes with Cold White Noodles, Lettuces, slices of Cucumber, Carrots, Raw Bean Sprouts and Dipping Sauce.  The portions of the Fried Shrimp can be &#34;slim-pickings&#34; to some, but its meant to share and you put all the trimmings and eat it as like a &#34; Summer Spring-Roll&#34;....

Then comes the Main Entrée.  At first they sent the wrong item, that consisted of Shrimp, Pork, Chicken and Beef item.  Luckily I managed to see, the differences.  Hubs wasn&#39;t too happy about the change but as customers or patrons, I believe we have the rights to request for the change.  Thankfully, our server obliged the change request.  The 2nd time, they got our order corrected.

Hubs like my order of Lamb way better than his dish.  I think, because of the &#34;change&#34; or the &#34;interrupted&#34; service due to the wrong dish, Hubs appetite disminished.  The SPICY wasn&#39;t spicy at all.  The Lamb dish comes with huge chunks of Lamb Meat, though some its not that tender to bite at one bite, yet the Broth that comes with the Lamb Meat, is flavorful, and is Loaded with Vegetables.  Its stated to be SPICY but to our taste bud, it is NOT SPICY at all.  This Dish alone was our Favorite.

Yes the service was prompt and fast.  Yes they obliged to our request.  YES, the dishes we ordered came LOADED with Vegetables such as Carrots, Cucumbers, Long Green Beans, Broccoli and Slices of Green Bell Peppers to name a few.

About 20:21hrs ish, when we ask for our check, received our check, we were given the WRONG Check.  *SIGH*  I still have to wave at our server and mentioned to him, that we were given the wrong check.  *DOUBLE SIGH*  At least our server rectify the problems.  

Maybe Golden Saigon is swamped with other patrons at that hour, in which I cannot deny so these incidents can happened and did happened while we were there.  All in all, a 3 STARs Generous review, since both Hubs and I like the Lamb Dish alot!

Might return BUT NOT In A Hurry.

The Dinner cost was $39.58 with tax.

Last night for dinner I had a rockin&#39; pan seared Scottish salmon (prepared med. rare, just like I like it, with crispy skin; ummmm:). It was accompanied by roasted Brussels sprouts, and heirloom carrots served beautifully over a bed of cauliflower puree. And what made it even better? Total price of that meal was $21. What a deal-and-a-half. Especially when I accompanied it with a reasonably priced glass of their house Chardonnay.

And hey, what&#39;s another thing that&#39;s great about having your evening eats at Sugar Mill?  Well, they make some of the best desserts in Denver too. Followed that salmon with a great apple crisp made with panko&#39;ed coconut topping over delicious apple cubes that were bursting with flavor, all topped off with a luscious small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

Bottom line: Sugar Mill you sure are one sweet restaurant!

There was a couple eating a pot pie and something else next to us and it looked really good. Anyway, there&#39;s a display when you first enter with tarts, macarons, cookies, and cakes. Everything was enjoyable.. and they have their own unique twist to their desserts. 

The baked Alaska comes in a form of a bar and it&#39;s beet flavored ice cream.. the flavor was a bit rich, a little too much for my girlfriend and she loves beets too. It is worth ordering though, the ice cream flavor seems to change.

The whiskey cake was great, decent punch of whiskey and nice balance of toffee stickiness. 

The donut sundae is towered with warm brioche donuts and ice cream.. it. was. good.

The lemon tart is pretty standard, it meringue on top is not overly sweet. 

Forgot to order the famous chocolate sphere.... 

The menu changes though... There are pictures of a red velvet creme brulé item I kept seeing on Yelp that is no longer on the menu that I wish I could have tried.  

The chef came out and talked to us and was very friendly. If I lived in Denver, I would definitely come back to order the sphere and check out the savory menu."

It&#39;s hard to find it from the street. We walked right passed it even tho we were looking for the location on our phones. They have a sign that only has the initial of the store SM and we were looking for Sugarmill. Alas we found it and all was right. Upon walking in you get a small display of their daily desserts and macaroons. Everything looked beautiful and tasty, we could have tried it all if we didn&#39;t already had dinner. We didn&#39;t have a reservation but the nice waitress let us have an empty table until the next reservation which worked out perfect for us since we were catching a flight. 

We ordered the baked Alaskan because we&#39;ve never had anything like it. It had beet ice cream! It was good, interesting mix of unusual ingredients. Something I can appreciate. We also ordered the lemon meringue tart, whisky cake, and donut ice cream. The whisky cake had a strong liquor favor which is different from others I&#39;ve had, not a bad or good thing just different. The lemon meringue was pretty ordinary and donut ice cream one reminded me a flambé, it was surprisingly better then I thought it would be. Overall, I like the thoughtfulness of the desserts and the care they put into creating it and presenting it. The chef was very nice and came back to asked how we were enjoying the desserts. It&#39;s a great date night place or a quick stop for 8 during a rushed day trip. Probably wanna make reservations in case you&#39;re not as lucky as us."

So many times I&#39;ve wished I could find a cute little spot like this to go have plated desserts at in the evening and I finally found it.  unfortunately not close to home, but at least I have a place to revisit when I come to Denver.  

They&#39;re desserts are perfectly  crafted right in front of you if you choose to sit at the bar.  
That in itself is  entertainment enough- if your a Food Network Fanatic like me.   To get to watch the masterpiece come together infront of you before you devour it is awesome!  

I love how balanced the flavors and textures of the desserts are.  It all taste so fresh and not overly sweet!

Desserts here are like an obra-- a libretto-- an aria-- they sing ART!

And no wonder too, with a CV like his, heading the pastry chefs at Marina Bay Sands SG (ironically, was there in Sept 2015), or working at the NYC Mandarin Oriental&#39;s pastry division ( whereby his bestie now heads up Bottega Louie in downtown LA)...

His Korean wife from Seoul, where I too happened to visit the same trip-- his talent is undeniable and his warmth and skills formidable--

If you say the last adjective in French, that would be super!!!! My cardamom crisp was the perfect texture interplay to my cheesecake dollops.

At $11, dessert is no small change, for it&#39;s dainty and European-sized, but my-- how lovely. Maine blueberries dotted my plates reminding me of the Stonewall kitchen jar of wild Maine blueberry jam in my fridge.

What a treat. I waddled home.

PS. Restaurant is not large. There is bar counter seating and wonderful outdoor seating, however.

PPS given a cookie when received the check. Like I needed more sugar. Ate it the next day though; ah, the weak-willed..."

The menu has your classic sandwiches, soups, and salads but they&#39;re far from boring. I recently had the grilled cheese sandwich on gluten free bread and it was perfection! Seriously gooey, rich, luscious cheese. Tomato, bacon, and a beautifully grilled crust. Mmmmm. Comes with creamy tomato soup, kettle cooked potato chips, and a pickle spear. A perfect lunch for $11 (plus an additional $3 for gf bread, which is a liiiittle high). Paired with a $9 garnacha... So great. 

Sugarmill is little but it&#39;s super bright and breezy. They have gorgeous colorful macarons and other stunning desserts on display upfront. They&#39;re seriously like works of art. 

They have a breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu, plus a great happy hour with $5 house wine. Can&#39;t wait to try their Burrata and order gluten free desserts in the future!"

the quiche and French toast were all out. so i picked the smoked salmon with bagel chips (which is kind of their take on the lox) and my boyfriend got the two eggs any style. ok you can&#39;t really mess up eggs and bacon. i could have made that at home. it came with a couple pieces of Applewood smoked bacon and potatoes. the eggs, bacon and potatoes were fine. nothing spectacular. the smoked salmon was just ok. the waiter boasted that their salmon was really good according to customers. so i decided to get that instead of the Benedict and boy did i regret that. that was more of a snack than a dish that&#39;s supposed to fill me up somewhat. i posted a Chai tea latte hot and it came out cold. not iced, but cold. i asked for it to be reheated, our waiter said that their Chai comes from the freezer...?? i don&#39;t get. 

disappointed with the rave reviews of this place. but you can&#39;t win them all. i will say i like the inside of the restaurant and the open-ness of the kitchen."

Nice flaky crust, creamy filling, tasty veggies and duck...  we had never thought about using duck for a pot pie but it works great and we&#39;d definitely order it again!

Finally ready for dessert, we were bummed when they had run out of the Teakoe Happy Camper Chai Bar, so we got the donut sundae instead.  Pretty solid dessert but nothing spectacular.  Ice cream and the chocolate &amp; caramel sauce were good, donut texture reminded me of a Krispy Kreme.  Overall, a good experience, I just wish they had the dessert we came to try."

I think Sugarmill is most noted for the baked goods. You walk in and can see some of the most beautiful pastries in the glass display case. To be honest, I haven&#39;t tried many of them, but the house made bread on the breakfast sandwich is seriously delicious.

My husbands breakfast sandwich was so hot it burned his mouth. What gives? Too cold quiche/too hot breakfast sandwich? Rookie mistake heating the quiche first, which I&#39;m assuming was done in the microwave. That&#39;s fine- I understand you can&#39;t fresh make each quiche.

Owned by Troy Guard in Denver&#39;s RiNo Neighborhood, Sugarmill is described as &#34;A Place Where Sweet and Savory Meet,&#34; and although a part of TAG Restaurant Group the Three Meal space maintains a decidedly independent feel under the current team as the open kitchen provides ample entertainment by allowing guests to watch the team create each plate.

Narrow and long with patterned wallpaper and a slick bar to one side as wood floors plus tables for two-to-six line the right side of the room, arrival at Sugarmill brings diners face to face with a pasty case featuring selections that rotate by both time of day and season, a two o&#39;clock arrival one one hand seeing things in a state of transition while on the other allowing a guest to watch the team hard at work on their craft.

Well priced and surprisingly diverse, the savory menu actually much larger than the one on which the concept is themed, lunch desserts are somewhat more limited than those at dinner but still offering a half dozen the question posed is what to order, the one-man waitstaff seemingly distracted and only willing to say &#34;Everything is Great.&#34;

Unfortunately told the &#34;Noahsphere&#34; of former Chef Noah French is a dinner-only off-menu request it was instead in simple favorites that Sugarmill experience would unfold and served as a duo both the Donut Sundae as well as the pricey Red Velvet Slice were perfectly competent, if not &#39;wowing,&#39; the former definitely hot from the frier beneath a quickly melting ball of Ice Cream while the triple-layer Cake upped the ante by adding buttermilk only to be held back a bit by using Vanilla Buttercream that compromised the smooth texture of traditional Cream Cheese.

Mistakenly given two extra scoops of Ice Cream because I&#39;d inquired about what was served atop the Doughnut, both elegant and creamy with the Butter Pecan a &#34;best of&#34; sort as restrained sweetness was imparted by finely chopped nuts, it was with these stricken from the bill that a few items to-go were selected, the macarons each crisp giving way to creamy filling while the Chocolate Chip Cookie featured several different types in brown butter, golden around the edges with a center just-set."

The menu is simple and sufficient. The SM Sammie (with applewood bacon, arugula, scrambled eggs, and Munster cheese on an everything bun) is probably my go-to order, but they have some other interesting offerings such as a daily quiche, a burrata and pesto sandwich, and a rosemary chicken salad.

Mr. E (my nearly four year old) is in love with their macarons. He often gets a pink one when we are there. It&#39;s maybe raspberry? I don&#39;t know because I never get a bite. Truthfully though, everything in their dessert/pastry case looks like something I want to put in my mouth and not share. 

The service has always been on point, even when I was there with a small person, which says a lot to me about the niceness of the staff. And I love the open, airy vibe in the places, especially on nice days when the garage door is open.

I&#39;ll have to make it a point to try the last meal on their menu I&#39;ve yet to have, dinner, because based on all my other experiences I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll enjoy it!"

Got there a little bit after our reservation time, but they were very accommodating and pleasant. There were a few deserts in the case that looked pretty darn good, and the decor was clean and fresh. Love the long marble bar. Very pretty. 

Sat down and realized that they only serve beer and wine. Ahhhh, pants! I had hoped to start my evening out with a thoughtfully crafted cocktail. I had a glass of wine that was meh. They have a small selection of beers and wines, which was a tad disappointing. Never one to give up, we persevered. 

Onto food. We started with burrata and prosciutto di parma--AMAZING. LOVE. ORDER ALWAYS. Grilled bread, creamy burrata with a rosemary olive oil and salty prosciutto were an absolute win. I&#39;d go back and order that any day.

We then ordered their pasta of the day, a pappardelle with some sort of beef ragu, and their meatloaf. They were both tasty, actually it might have been the best meatloaf I&#39;ve ever had...but the value wasn&#39;t there. Call me old school, but meatloaf maybe shouldn&#39;t cost $18? The pasta was handmade, so I&#39;m willing to pony up the big bucks for that, but I just found the value lacking overall. 

We took desert to go, a stout cupcake, and it was really tasty. Overall, I&#39;ll go back, but probably for that appetizer. Again, this one could be on me. I was expecting fireworks, an evening to remember, blah blah blah, and overall it was, as the rating belies, a-ok."

We came here for desserts and ordered the pineapple upside down cake, gluten free lemon chiffon cake with sorbet, the gluten-free Noahsphere, and gluten free chocolate cupcake with pistachio cream frosting. 

Being gluten free, it was nice to have options on the menu from which I could choose. I wish they had more dairy free options as well...but I was able to push that stuff aside and enjoy the gluten-free goodness they had to offer. :) 

The pineapple upside down cake took 25 minutes to make (which they told us about ahead of time)....and wow was it worth the wait!! Fresh, fresh, fresh and so delicious! 

The Noahsphere was also out of this world good! It wasn&#39;t just a dessert...it was an experience. Yum and fun. Just order it and you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Got some mimosas ($8) and I got a denver omelet and my partner ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and bacon.

Good food paired with a great ambiance was all we needed. We heard the dessert was a must, but we couldn&#39;t do another bite. Too bad because we observed the chefs hard at work the entire time working diligently on pastries and desserts.

The really bad: the red velvet cake. I saw them take it out and I saw them unwrapping saran wrap from the sides: I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first but that cake tasted like it was at least a few days old.

We had the chocolate pistachio cake and the presentation was as beautiful as the cake was delectable! The green stripe of pistachio struck a nice visual balance with the dark chocolate of the cake and the tang raspberry sauce balanced out the sweet of the cake beautifully!

I&#39;m not normally a fan of bread pudding or baked apples, but the apple bread pudding was perfect. There was just the right amount of savory and sweet happening, and the bread pudding was surprisingly light. The maple ice cream was the perfect compliment to the more savory side of the dessert.

The real showstopper for us, however, was the gnocchi. I am still dreaming of the gnocchi. The butter it was cooked in made for the perfect sauce and the bits of bacon put the dish over the top. Next time we are in the neighborhood, we will stop by for a full meal instead of just dessert + gnocchi."

It&#39;s on the salad too.  Seriously?  The list of dishes that looked appetizing to me that didn&#39;t contain black (or white) pepper was basically all the desserts and one salad.

I got the harvest salad and it was very delicious.  It was like my third or fourth choice in terms of menu items but since everything else couldn&#39;t be made the way I like, salad it was.  I liked that this dish had a good mixture of savory and sweet, with the cooked butternut squash and hot bacon adding to the savory while the dried cranberries contributed sweetly.  I would definitely recommend this salad.  The portion was very generous as well.

For dessert I tried their cinnamon apple bread pudding, which was a new take on the classic bread pudding. Theirs is a couple of entire slices of bread, soaked in the custard/pudding mixture and warmed/baked with cinnamon apples all over and in between the slices.  The bread was dense and spongy and I enjoyed it quite a lot.  I would recommend this as well.

I probably wouldn&#39;t come again for dinner for the lack of meaty entrees without pepper built-in, but for dessert, this would be a great place to go.  Unlike in a previous review, I didn&#39;t see them place any food-to-be-delivered-to-a-table on the counter in front of active diners.  They used the very end of the counter which was not set up for customers to sit at.  Restaurant was clean and attractive.  Small, intimate atmosphere.  Restrooms are shared with another establishment and you have to go through a little maze of hallways to find them.  Confusing, but manageable. 

Biggest downside: street parking was insane and I had to walk several blocks in a sort of dirty neighborhood.  Not as bad walking to the restaurant as after, walking when it&#39;s nighttime.  :("

My wife got the Noahsphere and I got the chocolate pistachio cream cake. The Noahsphere was amazing. Utterly amazing. Only bad thing I can think of were the marshmallows, but that&#39;s just a personal preference. The mascarpone was delicious. The chocolate pistachio cream cake was not my thing. It didn&#39;t taste like chocolate or pistachio. The consistency was a mushy soggy taste. The waitress noticed I didn&#39;t like it and allowed me to pick a free item of my choice between two cookies and a brownie. I picked the brownie. When we were paying for our bill, my wife wanted a blueberry muffin as well and she gave it to us for free. How awesome is that? She also kept apologizing, but it wasn&#39;t her fault. I&#39;m sure some people love the chocolate pistachio cream cake, but it just wasn&#39;t my thing. 

The brownie and blueberry muffin weren&#39;t very good. The brownie was incredibly soft and had a strong dark chocolate flavor. The blueberry muffin looks delicious, but didn&#39;t really taste like blueberry. It tasted like flour; almost a powdery taste. 

The atmosphere in there was pretty cool. Only con is the loud music. It&#39;s a cute date place, but it&#39;s hard to be able to hear the other person. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the chefs cook, which is really neat. There&#39;s also outdoor seating. They keep the garage door open so on a nice night, the breeze feels great.

They had more help that night considering it was a hot spot for that evening, and the nice server told us it would be a 45 min wait. Chef Noah saw us and waved hello, and we told him it was a spur of a moment last minute decision to eat out, but we would wait for a spot anyway because my boyfriend knew this is my favorite restaurant in all of Denver. 

We decided to wait next door at Americatus for a quick drink. As our drinks came, we got a call saying our table was ready in Sugarmill. It was what, only 10 minutes? God I love this place!

It was a set menu (4 courses!) that night and we got one of each of their dishes. I got the roasted lobster with sunchoke puree, foie gras torchon with banana bread, sea bream with broccoli ravioli, and red velvet creme brûlée! My boyfriend got the smoked salmon with caviar, king crab chowder, beef cheek with Brussels sprouts, and chocolate &amp; raspberry Napoleon with float. The lobster was so tasty and the chowder was just wow, and I&#39;m from San Francisco! The beef cheek falls apart and the fish was cooked perfectly per usual. The desserts? Need I explain? I mean, the place is called Sugarmill! Can you say, out of this world delicious?! I mean, really, those were all superb! Taste and presentation were spot on. And there are so many dishes in those courses that I will be dreaming about.

And I love the staff to boot so I may be a bit bias, but Chef Noah and everyone there are such talented people making wonderful creations. Please go visit and eat there NOW! They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner (and desserts of course). Try everything, you will not be disappoint!"

I cannot rank them according to how much I liked them because they were equally delicious and would cater to people differently. What I love about Sugarmill is that the desserts are not overly sweet and it is possible to finish the entire dessert without complaining about sugar overload. I plan to get the pineapple upside down the next time I come here - but remember that there is a 20 minute wait for them to get that done.

The Sugarmill
The Sugarmill

Blood races to your taste-bud spots
You will think that there&#39;s a fire
You can&#39;t fight flavor when flavor is hot

Let them show you things you&#39;ve never seen
Well, it could make you always wanna dine here again
Come spend the night inside the Sugarmill

-------------------

I had an Amazon local deal soon to expire (don&#39;t you love it when you catch an offer for a place you really wanted to go to?) so I managed to make it down here before a Secret Sipper event.  From 5:15pm to 6:15pm I was the only dine-in customer here on a Wednesday.  Lots of folks dropped by for take out desserts and savory dishes.  Needless to say, my service was excellent from start to finish.

Seated at the counter, I was able to watch the sugar-wizardry of Chef/Partner/GM Noah French.  I am sure I asked him way too many questions, but it really was like watching an artist in the midst of creation.  There were so many desserts from which to choose, but the lure of salted caramel meets chocolate was like a siren song.  This was a sea salt caramel chocolate tart and it was outstanding.  It was one of those desserts that causes one to set their fork down after each bite, so as to be able to bask in the afterglow of their flavor-gasm.

Savory Chef Tyler prepared my roasted chicken with asparagus, snap peas, zucchini, charred lemon, and chili aioli.  This was a half a chicken, slow roasted, then quickly heated up before service to crisp the skin.  I think it was one of the most delicious pieces of chicken I have ever enjoyed.  It was moist, tender, flavorful, wonderful, and the jus ran down to mix with the aioli and create a sauce that everything soaked up beautifully.  The veg were cooked perfectly to my liking (still firm, but not too crunchy).  Chef Tyler was also willing to answer my numerous questions and seemed like very nice guy.

I am ever so glad I finally made it here.  I will definitely be back."

First of all the atmosphere is fun, hip, lively. Noah French is an unbelievable chef. Welcoming, charismatic, engaged with his customers. He was very accommodating to special requests. 

Staff was super welcoming, friendly and helpful. They were positive, happy, energetic and also full of charisma. 

The menu is what blew us all away.
* The Beef Wellington was killer. meat was juicy, tender, perfectly cooked to perfection. The puff pastry was amazing. Soft, flaky.

* Roasted chicken was good - didn&#39;t amaze me. The chicken wasn&#39;t dry. huge portion. The skin was well cooked.

* Turkey Pot Pie - It was amazing. The crust was crispy and buttery. The stew was very creamy and the turkey was tender. Not Dry. The original menu item is the Beef Pot Pie but they were willing to use turkey instead.

* Pasta of the Day - Spaghetti - Good. Didn&#39;t blow me away. Had Zucchini which was great. Noodles were cooked well. Good portion. 

* Lasagna - Delicious. Cheesy. Such a beautiful presentation. Didn&#39;t feel heavy after eating. Great portion. Not too huge and sloppy!

DESSERTS WAS THE BEST PART.
We had the NOAHSPHERE aka &#34;death star&#34; - infused with marshmallows and other goodies wrapped up in a ball of chocolate then poured over with hot caramel. THIS WAS AMAZING. rich. sweet. Delicious. This is where French kills it!

Definitely an amazing place. Would come here again! :)"

I had only been here before to grab dessert at night (which is equally wonderful) and realized I wanted to try their food.

First and foremost, the menu is extremely simple but that does not detract from the quality. They also have fresh baked breakfast goodies (the banana nut muffin was to die for) that you can order which brings something fun with your breakfast. We ordered the croque madame and it was fabulous! The sauce is so thick - like a mixture between a gravy and hollandaise sauce - and compliments the swiss cheese, ham and eggs so well.

Secondly, the ambiance is great. I love the roll up garage doors. It was actually getting extremely warm outside in the sun so we chose to sit just inside the garage door which made for a wonderful indoor/outdoor experience.

Finally, the service was amazing. Our server not only recommended great dishes but also was attentive without being intrusive (gotta love this!). The most amazing part was I had an issue with my dish and she not only removed it from the table immediately but she also removed it from our check. This is an example of stellar customer service and guarantees that I will be back.

Thank you so much and I appreciate all that you did. Looking forward to my next visit!"

Look for this place, its actually easy to walk by since its sandwich between a few restaurants. The service was great when I went and was seated right away, granted I was there late at night. 

All I wanted was chocolate. So the torte it was! And boy did I get it! So delicious! My friend got a non chocolate peach shortcake, also yummy, but I love my chocolate!  So I don&#39;t think you can go wrong... they do have tea to go with your yummies...

All of the food was fantastic, the service was good, and the music was good too. I always like it when they leave a big bottle of water at the table for convenient refills. 

My girlfriend and I shared a Brussels sprouts salad to start, which was pretty good. Our entrees -- the gnudi and the salmon -- were fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the carrot varieties and creamed kale that were served with the salmon.

The highlight was dessert, of course, the PBJ waffle. Their other desserts are great too, but this is my favorite.

My only complaint is that they overcharged us. We used our Denver Dining Out passbook for the &#34;buy 1 entree get 1 free&#34; deal, but they just took the salad off our bill rather than one of our entrees. It was only a few dollars difference, but still annoying."

Dinner is infinitely better than lunch, as there are truly special items on the menu! Don&#39;t you ever dare not ordering the Beef Wellington. It&#39;s English food, but done so right by this contemporary American eatery. You can hear the flakiness when you cut (or bite) into the puff pastry, then the truffle blackened steak reveals its pink center, so beefy, so good. I&#39;m grateful for my BF letting me try his dinner, it&#39;s not a huge plate after all.

To not kill my appetite for the ultimate dessert at the end, I opted to get the BURRATA TOAST for my meal (olive oil / arugula / pine nuts / 8 year aged balsamic). OMG this simple yet sophisticated dish is even better than the Beef Wellington IMO! I wonder what kind of bread they use because after this, I wish they&#39;d sell the bread by the loaf. It was crusty on the outside and chewy with big holes on the inside. The creamy and cooling Burrata doesn&#39;t really have any flavor but is the perfect canvas for drizzled goodness: 8 year aged balsamic! My taste buds wanted to sing if they could! Thanks to the arugula salad which allowed me to eat slow (it&#39;s hard to pick up arugula if you ask me!) and savor each bite or I would&#39;ve inhaled this dish.

Got the legendary NOAHSPHERE for the end. The presentation is every bit worthy of the &#34;legend&#34; status, especially the chef would come and drizzle the hot caramel in front of you while you watch the chocolate shell melt. The dessert is not as sweet as it sounds (a plus) but I wasn&#39;t crazy about the mini marshmallows. They just don&#39;t go, I thought, with the rest of the artisanal ingredients. It looked cheap when the whole thing was filled with them... Sigh.

Our server was a quick and bubbly Asian girl, I liked her a lot. 

So, remember to come to dinner instead of lunch, the difference is between almost 5 stars (I&#39;m rating it at 4.5 stars) and 3 stars, respectively."

Sugarmill has the fancy-pants atmsophere and price tag and preparation but, lo! It also has the taste and texture that a pastry fiend like myself demands. Was I particularly a fan of the chocolate mousse tart and the peach whiskey macroon? Not particularly (too bland and too sweet, respectively). But would I eat that gorgeous tiramisu and the almond berry cake with all their addictive and curious accoutrements over and over until I assume Glutton as my first name? Yes, I would. 

Though we took our sweets to go, we did witness many a dessert served to the diners and this is the place to go for a ritual. Lots of couples sat romantically entwined and entranced by the pouring, dusting, and bite-composing of it all. And for a Friday night, in that part of town, I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice mix of people, not just your run-of-the-mill lo&#39;do&#39;ites. 

Also, there&#39;s an open kitchen where you can see some of the magic happening as well as bar-seating at the kitchen. If you&#39;re into chefy stuff, this might be your throne. The rest of the dining area is small and intimate. The disruptive mural on the wall I could do without, though.

Can&#39;t speak for the savory offerings here but if half as much care, skill, and taste is put into those dishes as the desserts, they must be tasty."

As I had an expired Living Social deal, I decided to stop in for brunch after swimming. I stopped in around 11 am, found parking on the street fairly easily and walked in. I was greeted and offered my choice of a table or a seat at the bar near where the food was being prepared. 

I decided to watch the food as my entertainment. I got to watch one of the kitchen staff prepare various baked goods, which made me want all the sweets! I ordered a vanilla latte, which was sweet enough on its own that I didn&#39;t need sugar (a rarity for me) and the SM Sammie. Despite multiple attempts, I realize that I hate arugula, no ifs or butts about it. Regardless, the sandwich was delish and I relished every bit of my latte.

On the way out, I decided to splurge and get a cake for our VDay dessert later that evening. It was a Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel cake. The frosting wasn&#39;t too sweet (sad for me), but the man adored it. I will tell you that nary a crumb of that cake was thrown away. We ate every bit, it was that good.

Writing this review has reminded me that I need to go back, maybe tomorrow. Yum!"

The corned beef hash was out of this world. But.... The baked good were disappointing. I got some macarons, cake pops and a blueberry scone. They were all prepared correctly and looked beautiful, but the flavors were just not there. For the prices of the baked goods, I was expecting something &#39;to die for&#39;.

After all, Los Chingones was one of the best hipster-style Mexican places I have ever been to. But Sugarmill, despite having an awesome staff and I am sure awesome savory food, kind of fell short when I was there.

I went with the Noahsphere and the Berries and Almond. The Noahsphere was definitely the better of the two and has a really impressive presentation when served. But this presentation means stray hunks of unmelted chocolate buffet a strangely not-rich crumble of brownies and nuts and somewhat insipid caramel sauce. Still not a bad dessert at all. 

Second was a Berries and Almond that consisted of financiers, cream, and sorbet. The sorbet was amazing. Maybe one of the better sorbets I have ever had, but the financiers were extremely stale and hard. I was surprised they served them, but whatever.

Everyone who works here is super nice though and the service was absolutely great. I know this is more than a 3-star restaurant and I know this joint has earned its place as one of Denver&#39;s top dessert spots, I just didn&#39;t have the best experience myself.

So when I heard he left, I felt a little sad but was still hopeful for the restaurant as it always had a delicious rotating menu (both dessert and savory).  We came here for valentines day and did the pre fixe menu.  We basically tried one of everything on the menu.  And enjoyed every single dish.  Honestly.  Some highlights include: 
Oysters 3 ways: So fresh and really tasty
Duck confit: OMG, I loved it.  So flavorful tender etc.  Everything you could want out of duck.
Braised lamb: seriously comforting plate of food.  it was like an elevated pot roast.  
Coconut panna cotta: came with like a mango puree and I wanted to bottle it and eat it all day.  also had merengue that was sooo good.

I&#39;ve stopped in on three separate occasions and have plans to return and try out their new menu come March 1. 

VISIT 1 - Sweet 

I was celebrating Valentine&#39;s a day early with my sweetheart. We took seats at the bar but instead of eyeing the menu we got fixated on the savory and sweet preparations before us. Chef Noah French prepares each dish with care and expertise. I could easily be entranced for hours. 

We finally settled on the chocolate jasmine bar and apple almond tart. What we thought would be our first (and only) course was actually #2 of 3. When you are offered an amuse bouche of lightly sweetened cream puffs with brandied cherries, you don&#39;t say no. 

The jasmine bar was rich and chocolately beyond desire but my favorite flavor was the muscavado ice cream. On return visits I&#39;ve seriously debated asking if I can buy the entire tub. Or how about I bring an empty pint to pack? Things to consider...

Our third course was two raspberry truffles gifted to us for Valentine&#39;s day. Break through the chocolate shell and you&#39;ll be rewarded with a creamy meltaway center. A truffle experience you won&#39;t soon forget.

VISIT 2 - Temptations

We eagerly returned the next day at 4:30pm to snag a table for Valentine&#39;s day. However, we didn&#39;t realize it was a fixed price menu and had really wanted to sample the full menu offerings. Noah sensed our distress and we agreed to return on a later night. But first? A sample of the light and sweet champagne sorbet. 

VISIT 3 - Savory

Just days later we were back, claiming our now usual seats at the bar, for a full dinner experience. Looking at the food preparations we immediately decided on the beet hummus currently being prepared. The bright pink color pulled us in. The dish actually offers two kinds, golden and red. I found the golden to have more flavor, but both were an interesting new take on the classic chickpea dish. 

We then accidentally (though I don&#39;t regret it) chose two mushroom-focused dishes, the mushroom toast and the pasta special. We also enjoyed more cream puffs, this time made savory with salmon and pickled onion.

The toast won me over without a fight. A large slice of charred bread piled high with roasted mushrooms and greens. Drizzled in olive oil, you&#39;ll raise a white flag and give in too.  

The pasta featured housemade fettuccine, parmesan mushroom cream sauce, artichokes, and a crispy salmon. The dish was full of familiar and new (I&#39;ve never had salmon crisped like this) and was a portion big enough to share. 

We finished our evening with a latte and when we refused dessert (I know, I know, but we were really stuffed) we were offered complimentary macarons, lemon and mocha. Next time we&#39;ll know better and just order something to share. 

---

If I could, I would frequent Sugarmill even more than I currently do. I would love to sit at the counter with my work, jamming out to the soul music, taking in the scents, snacking on sweet bites, and watching Noah and his crew do their thing.

Chef Noah French makes it so you can&#39;t not come back, and he does so with genuine care and a love of the food he presents."

I came here late at night not too long before their closing time and was surprised by the welcoming nature of the hostess, the patience and great service from the chef and the availability of tables. It was a Friday night so I expected there to be a long wait the way I heard D-Bar Desserts gets. 

I came here because a classmate of mine recommended it to me. My friends and I ordered three desserts to be shared amongst the four of us and we were not disappointed with any of them. They all superseded my expectations and left me wanting to come back. 

We ordered:

1. red velvet creme brule (red velvet cake with a top layer of cream cheese creme brule) and with a 5 spice streusel
2. coconut haupia (a caramel cookie that looks like an Italian cannoli with coconut haupia cream) with some banana gelato-like ice cream (they ran out of the pineapple ice cream).
3. bunch of bananas (banana cheesecake/walnut cake with a banana and vanilla soda float). 

5 stars for presentation, 5 stars for service and 5 stars for taste. 

I&#39;m normally indifferent to red velvet stuff but I thought the concept of a cream cheese creme brule layer was genius and expertly executed.

I also liked the experience of pouring in my own vanilla soda into the banana ice cream shake that accompanied the banana cake. The chef took his time to come to our table to explain what he created. 

I loved the giant light bulbs and the marbled tables/counters. The decor was whimsical and the windows look like a converted garage door. 

Their cocktails sounded really amazing too but I was too full (plus was DD) so wasn&#39;t able to try more of their menu items.

As the name implies, the kitchen&#39;s dessert program is the focus.

Between that and the amount of times we wind up in the restaurant, I think we&#39;ve had everything they&#39;ve ever made. We&#39;ve never been disappointed, though maybe our eyes have been too big for our stomachs on a few occasions. I&#39;ve only eaten dinner there on a handful of occassions, but I wouldn&#39;t steer you away. The prices are moderate, and you often get a filling and fancy entree.

It&#39;s right on Larimer, and is perfect for a casual dinner, or an after dinner date. The highlights of course are the desserts! 

There will likely be a wait in the evening, but it&#39;s worth it. The line moves relatively fast as many people are just there for dessert. If you can, try to grab a seat the bar. Then you can watch Noah himself prepare the Noahsphere. That&#39;s the only item I tried, and I highly recommend it. A mixture of marshmallows, brownies and candied pecans wrapped in a hollow chocolate shell. It&#39;s then melted with hot caramel and placed over a delicious cloud of light and fluffy whipped cream. Yum!

We also saw them make several of their pot pies that night. After getting a whiff of the smell, and seeing all the care and perfection that gets put in, I&#39;ll definitely want to try that next time!"

It&#39;s a cute little place with tons of French inspired cuisine/pastry goodies. Macaroons were pretty good. Not the absolute best that I&#39;ve had, but for their size (almost twice as big as Sucré in Nola) and extremely reasonable price ($1.25 each), they were a steal! 

We also had their Haupia dessert (which I was definitely excited to try being a Hawaiian local myself), and to my surprise, the asst pastry chef was from Hawaii and this was such a great play on a Classic Hawaiian dessert! Haupia custard/cream filled a flaky delicious cookie, served alongside coconut/cilantro/pineapple ice cream. Great balance of sweetness and freshness!

Overall, service was great and prices were very reasonable. If I lived in Denver, I would be here too often! LOVE"

Star 1 = The staff makes my experience every time. A sweet, smiley young woman was at the counter and helped us decide what we wanted to eat, which sauces were spicier, what was a better deal and the like. we are THOSE people, but she was bubbly, nice and genuinely liked her job :)

Star 2 = The food is delicious. I&#39;ve previously eaten their breakfast burritos, but wanted to try something different. I opted for the stuffed sopapilla with chicken and beans, smothered in Christmas chili - both red and green! The others in our party ordered the fajitas, and various breakfast dishes and were impressed. The biggest hit of the meal? The complimentary sopapiilla&#39;s drizzled with honey! They were perfectly cooked, and delicious, along with the everything we tried.

Star 3 = Prices are CHEAP. For my entire meal, with a few add on&#39;s it was under $10!

My husband and I have been visiting this specific Little Anita&#39;s for over ten years - he&#39;s an ABQ native &amp; it&#39;s the best place to eat authentic New Mexican Green Chile in Colorado. In the last 8 months we have had all sorts of weird things happen regarding the Sopapillas. For 9 years and 2 months of the last ten years we always received sopapillas with our meals; breakfast, lunch, &amp; dinner. A while ago we stopped receiving them regularly. One staff member said we had to request them when we ordered. At a later date she said they only served them when they saw you were finished with your meal. That time, however, we finished and waited around for Sopapillas and never received them, even after asking for them. 

Since then, sometimes they come out with our order. Other times they come out after we&#39;ve finished eating. Other times we don&#39;t get them at all. Whenever we ask a staff member we get a different answer, and whenever we specifically request sopapillas coming WITH our meal, they are inconsistent with if they do or don&#39;t. 

We like the Sopapillas to soak up the extra chile (YUM) so the lack of regularity is really frustrating."

This restauant is located at very unassuming strip mall location.  I was planning to go to subway next door but definitely glad to make the right turn...  yes, they are right side of subway

I am particular about the Mexican restaurants I partake in visiting. I am picky. I usually prefer homemade. But there is something about Little Anita&#39;s that keeps me coming back. It&#39;s the red sauce used to smother their stuffed sopapillas. It is spicy and it is freakishly and unnaturally delicious. It is addicting. I get a beef and bean stuffed sopapilla smothered in red goodness.

The posole is the best I have had outside of homemade. I get it to go so I can savor the delight in my own home. I usually get a few extra flour tortillas.

Think fast casual. You order and pay at the front but can tell them if you&#39;d like it to go or to eat there. I ended up eating there, but could definitely see myself getting some take out food from time to time. 

I ordered the chicken and bean burrito with christmas chili, with sides of rice and beans. The beans were delicious and silky. I try to make my own at home, but they never turn out as silky. I didn&#39;t care too much for the green chili, as it didn&#39;t have as much flavor as the red. The red had a nice heat to it and was more robust in flavor. Bummer, because I usually prefer green! 

My love got a beef burrito, and he loved it. I snuck a bite of the beef and it was quite tasty and well seasoned. We also shared a bowl of posole, my latest obsession. I know all posoles are different and albeit it was the second bowl I&#39;ve had in my whole life, but I think I wanted it to be something else. The first time I had it, it was brothier. This one was a bit thicker and heartier, and brought a nice heat. It was good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but wasn&#39;t what I was looking for. 

I could tell you more about my posole woes here but I won&#39;t get carried away and simply tell you that if you&#39;re in the area, this would be a great spot to grab a meal. Friendly service, good food, and they give you sopapillas for dessert. I mean really, what&#39;s not to like?"

I ordered a breakfast burrito with eggs and bacon smothered in green chile and it didn&#39;t disappoint. We also had chips and salsa and sopaipillas, which were basically your standard fair.

Besides the burrito, the star of the show was the Customer Service. The girl at the cash register was incredibly friendly, she knew her regulars by name, and treated everyone like they were special, even complimenting my Albert Einstein t-shirt. I said the word sopaipilla from my table and the next thing I knew, she said, &#34;Did we forget your sopaipillas?&#34; And the sopaipillas were delivered instantly.

For quick and simple New Mexican food, Little Anita&#39;s seems to be a dominant contender in Denver. I&#39;ve only gotten take-out once, but I intend to return for more and try other menu items. A location is close to my home so I plan on doing take-out so I can eat at home."

But it&#39;s always good, cheap and quick, so it&#39;s not clear why I don&#39;t go here more.  I&#39;ll have to fix that.  They do authentic New Mexican food here, and it&#39;s hot.  Even the mild chile packs a punch (beware - they do it differently than most places here - the red is the hot and the green is the mild, as opposed to the other way around like you normally see).  Meats are always well-prepared, and the various combo platters give you a ton of food if you are really hungry.  Plus you can get the breakfast menu until 1 pm.  What&#39;s not to like?  Oh yeah, the strip mall that it&#39;s in - not much you can do about that.  Be careful when trying to get in or out of that parking lot, it&#39;s not easy.

Ordered the Carne Adovada Enchiladas...not impressed at all. My dish came out almost immediately which most likely means it was quickly pieced together.

    The enchiladas had three things I could detect: meat, tortilla, and sauce...none of which had much flavor.

 Yes the sauce was spicy but it was one dimensional, and flavorless.

New Mexican CHILE is made from red chile powder and the green chile is roasted and not a sauce. We have Little Anita&#39;s all over Albuquerque, NM. New Mexicans like it just as much. The combination plates are always a great choice. If you get a sopa, just know they are not supposed to be deep fried or extremely crunchy. Soft on the outside and soft on the inside. What Little Anita offers is not honey to go with these, it&#39;s a mix of corn syrup and sugar, maybe some honey mixed in.

I hope they go back to serving the sopapillas fresh and during your meal, not at the beginning.

I had there New Mexico plate which consisted of a bought in tortilla, frozen chicken fried steak, frozen potato pieces, and canned refried beans. I don&#39;t know if they make their red sauce but it is nasty. It tastes very stale, like dried oregano that has been sitting in the jar too long. 

That said their burrito is OK and cheap. And their green sauce is better than their red. 

How Little Anitas maintains the clientele or a four star review is easily explained by only white people eating there. No Mexicans at your favorite Mexican place? It sucks. Even if you can&#39;t tell.

No big deal, but it caught us off guard and it took us longer than expected to figure out our order. But, the staff were very patient and friendly with us as we held up the rest of the line.

I had the #2 Combination so I pretty much had a sampling of every item on the menu, $10 for enough food to last me a week. The chewy cheese enchilada is great, the tamale is tasty, the taco is just a taco, and the chile relleno is easily the best part of this plate. I don&#39;t even like chile relleno and I scarfed that down first.
At the end of the day, New Mexican comes down to a single decision. Red chili or green?Good news is, you can&#39;t go wrong with either, especially at Little Anita&#39;s, and when in doubt you can always go with Christmas. And a meal at Little Anita&#39;s is like Christmas coming early."

Packed full of flavor and high quality.  I love their green chili that you can get on the side. It has great warmth to it.  If the burritos don&#39;t get your taste buds going, maybe their warm sopapillas they bring to the table will.  Drizzle some honey on those bad boys and get yourself ready for a real treat.  These sopapillas are wonderful.

You get a sopacilla with your order which adds a nice touch, but napkins were at a premium in the to-go bag :/. Expecting pouch of honey for the sopacilla would of been a stretch too, but could be a nice added touch to draw more &amp; more repeats.

The burrito is tasty.

Free Sopapillas with your meal that were super yummy.

The only reason I wouldn&#39;t give this place 5 stars is that the ambiance is really lacking. Very small and crowded, counter service only, the door lets in a chill in winter and the tables and chairs are bare minimum for comfort.

So anyway, after making do at several establishments, I thought I would give Anita a try. Now in Albuquerque- Anita&#39;s is by no means the piece de resistance of NM cuisine, but I was hard up. It is known as a tourist centered chain- that is local to NM, but their are many mom and pop places, that kill in comparison. Maybe that is not fair as I never ate their in NM, because my chef friends poo pooed it! I had the stacked enchiladas a shredded beef and pork- with Christmas Chile. That means red and green chile, to those not indoctrinated to the faith. Boyfriend had the deluxe burrito. I would get the enchiladas again, but skip the red chile, not my favorite. The green however, was authentic, and is closer to the source than anywhere else I have found as so far. I will keep you posted. This is an order at the counter restaurant- no frills. They make their own tamales which I almost ordered. They also give you a little free sopapillia, which was adequate."

Plus, you can also get a regular dessert sopapilla to go with it and all is right with the world.

You really can&#39;t beat it and for that reason, Little Anita&#39;s will be working itself into my lunchtime rotation more often.

There was a period of time when their veggie green chile was not technically vegetarian (made with beef broth) but it has since been resolved (or I&#39;ll pretend it has, &#39;cause it&#39;s just so good).

It&#39;s a place where you walk in and order and then sit down.  Since I was just picking up, I awkwardly stood there (fortunately not for long) so next time I&#39;d probably call in my order before leaving work.  The restaurant is small and busy.

Inside on remembrance was clean and the staff was efficient and friendly which scores big points. They sold their own tortillas as usual either 6 or 12&#34; and they also took down all the little publicized accolade articles about them like ten years old...
Now they have some amazingly awesome oil paintings for sale and hey it was different : )
So about those burritos- great.. probably a 7-8. But for this Colorado native the red is the boss and it left a nice lingering burn for a good 15 minutes even with water and that my friend is what good red chile is about- the green, well king soopers basic green hot is better  -I only wish more places did the rojo sauce right.. thumbs up paisano&#39;s."

Located on the busiest road in Colorado, it not only smells fantastic but tastes fantastic. Is it authentic Mexican food? How the hell should I know?! However, it tastes amazing.

I orded the Beef and Bean Tostada as well as a bean burrito with rice and beans on the side. The food was cooked to order and tasted fresh. The only downside is the large portion of the burrito. It could be scaled down a bit with the beans inside making it easier to either cut or pick up the burrito. With every entree ordered, one gets a sopapia. Now these are the only reason to order multiple entrees. They are fantastic and are made in house fresh daily.

If you take it to go, it comes in an aluminum dish. Amalgam filling wearers beware. It tastes so good. Do not get red. This is Colorado for goodness sake. Get the green, and ask for bacon instead of chorizo. Extra papitas for extra goodness. If I recall, it&#39;s about $8-10 bucks for the one burrito by the time you walk out the door.

I belched up from the grease in the chili all morning

The only warning I will give is to make sure you stick with this location. They have another in the DTC off of Arapahoe road.

Never had this type of bread served a mexican place before.  It was good and went well with the green chili.

I was referred from a neighbor and was nothing short of eager to get there and try it out. I walked in tonight not before checking out the front door which only had breakfast items.. I wasn&#39;t sure I was at the right place being it 7:30pm but after I peeked inside I saw a little crowd gathering at the front counter. I was quietly greeted as I walked in by a cute petite curley haired gal whom I quickly notified her it was my first time just to see if she was polite or what was to offer. As I looked up at the menu on the wall I quickly discover the menu is much larger than what I saw on the front door and spotted my fav within seconds. I was surprised to see the &#34;combo&#34; offer which includes rice and beans AND green or red chili.. As a New Mexico native I was nothing short of giddy!! I ordered a shredded chicken burrito smothered in green chili combo with a side of chips and salsa and sour cream TO GO!  Much to my surprise when I arrived home I opened the bag to find a so-papilla!! Whaaaat!? I didn&#39;t ask for that. BONUS YUM! Also tend to rate my Mexican food by their salsa before the meal comes. A definite SOLD in my book! It&#39;s the perfect texture and spice and perfectly portioned! I was also VERY thrilled with my food not contained in styrofoam as its nearly impossible to eat a burrito in. My burrito always pleasantly smothered in cheese, green chili as I requested and tomato.

Our hosts brought us to Little Anita&#39;s for a late dinner last Saturday after skiing. 
The place was empty except for maybe 2 or 3 employees-- I think this is mostly a lunch place. They gave us some chips and salsa (real salsa, and super hot to my taste). We ordered some margaritas and each of us ordered a combination plate. I ordered the #7 combination plate:

A small beef burrito, pork tamale, and a cheese enchilada, topped with cheddar cheese and red or green chile. ($10.50)- see picture.

I picked the green chile and oh-my-lord- my eyelids were sweating. A very filling, huge meal for un poco dinero. 

At the end of the meal, they brought us these hollow pastries (like fried dough) and some honey to put on top. I wish I could remember what they were called, but I believe they were complimentary. They were a light, perfect ending to a delicious meal.

For me the biggest thing is food allergies. I have a strange food allergy, celery, and some normal ones, cashews and pistachios. Since this is a vegetarian and vegan cafe that is extremely difficult to find something that I can eat. Most broths/ sauces/ spice mixes may or may not have celery in them so it is always a challenge. Many vegan/ vegetarian dishes use cashews as fatty milk substitutes. Here however, when I walk in I tell them my allergy, the run to the kitchen where everything is made by hand and they know every single ingredient. Then they inform me there is celery at the salad bar and what every dishes I cannot have. Thats all. I have never had such a simple time at a vegan restaurant finding food. 

It is such a relief to find healthy food, with no mystery ingredients, and truly delicious food. We are no longer in the neighborhood but go out of our way to visit because it has my heart by my stomach!"

Because those of you who eat beautiful, defenseless creatures are lacking the consciousness I need when reading reviews regarding vegan food and taste.


Huge things to consider as majorly awesome!


(1) no meat anywhere! 

As a vegan, many buffets are &#34;vegan-friendly,&#34; but then I still have to look around at other patrons stuffing their faces with the lives of beautiful, defenseless creatures. 

There is no meat smell, no meat lingering on the buffet or on the tables around you.  

100% VEGAN, this is a very great thing =)


(2) Some of you are right, . . . the spices can be a bit underwhelming, BUT we just bring our own little spice jar in our bag and spice up our dishes =) 

I would guess that if they did spice up their buffet, then they would have complaints about it being &#34;too spicy.&#34; 


(3) Govindas is all about moderation, . . . their hour of operation are moderate, their refills on vegan chai are moderate. . . this is not a place to get stuffed &amp; so full you can barely walk out of the door (like most buffets).


(4) Respect their hustle and their vision.  

How many establishments can call themselves 100% vegan and say they are truly dedicated to the cause? =)  


(5) Go VEGAN!"

Granted we got there 30 minutes before closing, but the problem wasn&#39;t that there wasn&#39;t enough food on the buffet (there was hardly anything, but they did bring out more choices to fill in items that had been depleted).  The problem was that nothing had any flavor!  Zero. Zip. Nada.
It was as if no spices, herbs, salt or pepper had been used on any of the food...and any natural flavors had mysteriously been removed from the food.  The only thing with any taste at all was a tamarind tea - and that was delicious!

We&#39;d had high hopes, as a good, one-off vegan restaurant would be a wonderful find.

I am not vegan. Maybe my tastes biased my expectations. I do like to eat food, including vegetables and I was very disappointed. 

The water cup was tiny and half-full. The food was expensive for what it was. All of the dishes I ate were under seasoned and bland. The polenta &#34;pizza&#34; was no exception, despite being the &#34;best thing on the buffet&#34;. 

The desserts were good and it surprised me. However, they were not included in the price of the buffet, and were not labled as such. So, it was a $20 meal of bland beans and a moderately good dessert.

The best part is that not only are they vegan, but they seem to be a healthy vegan. There wasn&#39;t a lot of fake cheese or fake whatever, and everything seemed fairly low sodium and low oil. LOVE!!!!

We stopped by late in the morning, closer to their closing hours, but they luckily still had a good selection of food left. There was a great vegetable soup, some lentil and chickpea curries, some little soy meatball thingies, and their homemade papadum and bread. For one thing, I&#39;ve had papadum in a lot of restaurants and this was easily the best stuff I&#39;ve ever had. Whatever you guys are doing to make this food, you are doing it perfectly. 

The salad bad was the only part we didn&#39;t really touch, because salad bars are more or less all the same. We completely pigged out on the hot food side. I say pigged out, but with such wholesome food as this, you really can&#39;t eat that much. How many lentils can one really eat? We tried our best to fit as much in because it was all so delicious. 

I also highly recommend their lemon tamarind iced tea drink. Super, super tasty.

We went here for my birthday since I&#39;ve wanted to try this place for years. A nightly changing all vegetarian buffet with vegan and gluten free options? It must have been made for me. 

We came on Greek night and the special entree was Musaka which is a Greek dish normally filled with meat. Govinda&#39;s version was made with lentils and they had a dairy free version as well as a dairy one. This meal was superb with a powerful flavor and satisfying texture. 

The chickpea stir fry was also phenomenal (I love chickpeas) and the green beans rounded out for a great meal. They had a light pasta with some herbs that was to die for. 

I&#39;m not sure how they come up with what mix to serve together. When looking at the buffet it seemed a little hap hazard, but when it was all on my plate it just worked together. 

I had the chai to drink, as I do everywhere. They make their own and it is fantastic! Perfectly sweet and spicy. I probably had five cups. 

The staff at first seemed kind of stand offish. They didn&#39;t come over right away and so we jumped right on the buffet. I think this was mostly due to it being a busy night. After our waitress did come over she was pleasant and after asking her a few questions I was able to get her to talk a little bit. 

The only downside for me is that this place is very far from home. While this will make trips here difficult I will definitely be back and try the other tasty creations they come up with."

We liked it so much that we signed up to be e-mailed when there are special events and new menu items (not something I do EVER). I got an e-mail today asking if I&#39;d write a review and I felt the need to spread the word about this place (not something I do very often). 

Interestingly, when I was taken to their website, I saw that it has a link to the documentary Cowspiracy, which is actually what pushed me into making my diet nearly 100% plant-based after years of being a hardcore carnivore. Doesn&#39;t have much to do with anything other than being another sign that this is a place where I belong and will return to regularly.

For starters, the building is truly adorable. When we walked in, we were kindly greeted and taken care of by a lovely girl, wish I had caught her name! I was so delighted by the assortment of food at the buffet, even though it is very small! Still a great deal of variety. I feel so much in-love with a tahini dressing they had for the salad bar. Some other highlights were the kale and sweet potato dish and the good shepherds pies with this amazing gravy!!!! I also had a banana chocolate cake that was to die for.
But what I was overly impressed with was the fact that the owner was around refilling waters and talking to people. We had the pleasure of speaking to him, and oh my goodness was he a delight! Such a nice, genuine man who took the time to have a conversation with us and gave us big hug goodbye.
I cannot stress how much I love this place. Vegans and non-vegans...it&#39;s a must!! I love 1000% be coming back on many occasions.

It is very hard find good vegan food, needless to say, vegan buffet. It&#39;s definitely a vegan paradise. 
We tried everything for sure. Most of their dishes were made out of organic ingredients which makes the experience more pleasant. The patio area was very cozy, casual, and cute! The only down side of it is the metal chairs. No cushion. For someone like me, might find it hard to seat on.
The food was great! Salad bar has all kinds of greens, corns, black olives, salsa, with vegan dressings. They make their own salad dressings- Italy dressing, almond dressing, and tahini dressing. Yum! Hot dishes might be different everyday. We had cabbage stuffed, vegan spinach lasagna, broccoli and carrot (Indian curry flavor I think), Chana curry (chickpeas curry, I guess), green curry potato (not sure, I guess again). Everything was good! 
The most amazing part of this place is the atmosphere that the owners make. They are so welcoming, friendly, and hospitality. They make the you feel like dinning at home. Overall, I had a very satisfying and stuffing experience. 
I believe the price for buffet is $20 per person. Definitely recommend this place."

We arrived in Denver after visiting family in the Detroit area (land of coney dogs, burgers and pizza...not the most veggie friendly local) on 8/4/16 and after dealing with afternoon Denver traffic to pick up our rental car we were famished so I started checking out happycow.net for some vegetarian/vegan options in the area. This was one of the closer options so we went for it. Wow, wow, WOW are we glad we did. On the website it said vegan &#34;friendly&#34; but when we got there the sign outside said &#34;happy to announce completely vegan!&#34; Score!!
There was a salad bar with all the options you would expect on a vegan salad bar (more than just tomatoes and cucumbers, YAY!), looked clean and well stocked, but the best part was the homemade salad dressings!! There were several options and I had a really hard time deciding on which one to go with; went with the &#39;almond caesar&#39; and was not disappointed. 
Then...the hot bar/buffet, I still have dreams....homemade bread, perfectly cooked veggie medley, rice pilaf, pesto pasta, curried garbanzos (which my kids went NUTS over!), creamed kale (AMAZING!!), lentil soup, veggie croquets in a &#34;spicy&#34; tomato sauce (wasn&#39;t really spicy but that was a good thing since I&#39;m a wimp and, you know...the kids. My son LOVED them and went back for more! :)). I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing something but I&#39;m not forgetting the relief and satiation after tasting it all and going back for more. We also ordered the samosas in case the kids didn&#39;t like the buffet options, which we didn&#39;t need and were a bit too spicy for me and the kids&#39; liking but the husband enjoyed them.
It was reasonably priced, everyone was friendly and more than happy to discuss the options/ingredients and after leaving the land of coneys, such a wonderful, satisfying dining experience to kick-off our CO vacation. Only regret was not stopping by on our way out of town! Can&#39;t wait to visit next time we&#39;re in town!"

There was one dish that was pretty good, if spicier than my liking, and I mainly had that and rice. I tried the other things and the soup and was not impressed. The salad bar selection was decent but dressings were eh.

Now, having said that, the people were AMAZINGLY nice. Super accommodating and eager to please. I would probably go back just for them. And since they change what&#39;s offered in the buffet every night I can hope that the food might be better next time.

Everything is prepared from starch and in addition to great food, they provide a funky atmosphere and personal service that is both fun and a joy to experience.

I got here a little after 1 PM, after the main lunch crowd had left.  All-in-all, I had a pleasant experience.  I ate outside on their patio listening to some very relaxing music.  I found the people who work here and run the place to be very nice and accommodating.

I&#39;m not vegan or vegetarian, but I found the food to be tasty.  It was all extremely flavorful, but maybe a bit too much so.  Generally I&#39;m not one to complain about flavor since I seek out flavorful food as a rule, but I wouldn&#39;t have minded something like some plain steamed veggies to balance out the offerings that had some really strong flavors.  For example, the day I went the items on the hot part of the buffet were a pasta salad (it was almost gone so I wasn&#39;t able to try that), papadum (lentil crackers), black bean soup, curried chickpeas, creamed mixed veggies with thyme, collards in a mustard sauce, and rice.  Again, everything was delicious on its own, but together as a meal, the flavors were overwhelming for me.  I like a little more balance.  I was also surprised that there weren&#39;t more items to choose from, but maybe it was just the day I went.

Again, this was a very pleasant place to relax and have some lunch.  I&#39;d be inclined to stop by and try it again."

This review is about my first experience in a vegetarian restaurant  in which I am not familiar with this type of food serve in Govinda&#39;s Garden Cafe, a Laid-back, spiritual spot preparing seasonal vegetarian &amp; vegan specialties. I entered and automatically was greeted, not as a customer but as a friend, very friendly staff, caring, lay back, and happy. So far I like this place. I went in the evening and did not had to order, everything was in a buffet style with about 14 types of food, just enough to keep you satisfied. I picked a nut loaf, cream sauce steamed veggies, garbanzo curry, dale bean soup, basmati rice, and a lot of vegetables of course. 
I returned to my seat and notice the soothing meditative Indian music in the background and paintings of different gods, adding to the chill, relaxing, and calming vibe I get from Govinda&#39;s. The nut loaf was full of nutty flavor with a little sweetness, very few condiments but just enough to enhance the flavor, delicious in other words. My tamarind cold tea was exceptional, especially because it didn&#39;t feel over sweetened and you can actually taste the tamarind. The cream sauce steamed veggies is even better, thoroughly steamed veggies with a green cream sauce that adds a lot of flavor. The garbanzo curry was my favorite, the sauce, texture, and flavor of the garbanzos was on point, leaving me begging for more. Unfortunately the basmati rice was a little dry, but with some garbanzo sauce poured on top, it becomes amazing. It was an amazing place to eat and if all vegan/vegetarian food is like this I can see myself quitting the carnivorous life-style!

Tea:           $1.50                         Buffet:        $12.95                          Total cost:  $14.45"

Moving on to the food, the salad bar was filled with fresh vegetables. Super fresh. Grated beets and carrots, dark green spinach, bright green lettuce, perfectly prepared chickpeas, and more! They make their own salad dressings, Vegan and gluten free. They also have a hot bar filled with a delicious variety of vegetarian dishes.

I carefully choose my restaurants so that I don&#39;t stumble into places I&#39;m not going to enjoy. So this is painful for me. Especially because I support vegan businesses.

But the owner sealed her fate when she gave me a bill for full price. I supported her monetarily without protest and so this review will happen. 

Thanksgiving is my birthday.  As a vegan this less than ideal. Stuck out of town with a huge family that is not vegan can make things tense. When they suggested the next day that we all go to vegan food. I was thrilled and wanted to ensure they all had good experiences. I chose what yelp assured me was the top choice for vegan eating in the area. And for 20 people a buffet was just icing on the cake.

I called as we were leaving the house and found out that because it&#39;s black Friday they are doing a $10 &#34;pizza, pasta, salad&#34; buffet...no ordering off the menu. I tell them that we have a party of 20 and they say they&#39;ll set right up.

We arrived and the owner tells us about the great tea and water.  And the kids all start to get food.  By the time I settle in the table and get to the buffet 5 of our first wave of people have plates. I find out the entire buffet is a pre-made salad (not a buffet style salad bar with many toppings), three dressings, one tray of pasta with minimal chopped veggies cooked in, and two pizzas. And the pizzas were not vegan. Also the sign says endless buffet outside.  But there&#39;s a sign on the buffet that urges you to only take 2 servings. As an added bonus two independent members of my party saw the staff touch with bare hands the pizza on the buffet.

Let&#39;s recap: as a vegan for $10 I can get 2 plates of salad and mediocre pasta. Let&#39;s be real: this is a situation many vegans find themselves in when dining with meat eaters at non veg places. But at a veg place? Why I never.

So I called the cars which were late and redirected them to native foods. Then I approached the owner who was busy explaining why they didn&#39;t have a real buffet to another couple who promptly left. I informed her of the situation: I want to eat really excellent vegan food for my birthday.  She was obviously embarrassed about her restaurant&#39;s current state and kept telling me about how she &#34;told the chef to make vegan pizza but he must have forgotten.&#34; Then she hugged me and suggested she would only charge me for the kids since just about everybody else only had a bowl of salad. And nobody had gotten a second plate. Then somehow she decided giving me a free cookie (regularly $2.50 - not included on the buffet, but super delicious) was discount enough. She tried to finally serve my family water and tea ( she&#39;d been too busy talking to would be customers ever since she described the buffet to us to serve beverages before) as I was trying to get them up and out.  I got her back to the counter for her to hem and haw and say &#34;I&#39;m going to have to charge you full price&#34; and she whips out a bill for $100. I paid it. I even left a small tip - just because they were pitiful that night doesn&#39;t mean I get to be less of a person. On our way out she shoves menus into everyone&#39;s hand and keeps telling us this isn&#39;t the norm and to please come back. She offers no incentive.

I understand having a bad night because of unforseen circumstances but this looked like they half-assed dinner because they expected too few people would show to make a full buffet profitable.  But I can&#39;t respect that.  I would have respected a &#34;we are closed for the holiday to spend time with loved ones&#34; sign. This?  This is preparing to fail and scrambling to look like you&#39;re normally better.

We had a lovely time at native foods and the staff there told us that normally govindas is quite good. I&#39;d love to return on a normal night but I probably won&#39;t since I live out of state and my Denver family isn&#39;t vegan. It&#39;s a damn shame."

My boyfriend is a big meat eater and always enjoys the variety of foods they have, and the rich flavors. I love everything from their heavenly bread to the unique salad dressings. This isn&#39;t your usual restaurant experience though, they don&#39;t have a menu where you select an entree, you just pay twelve bucks and eat everything the buffet has to offer. And the menu changes daily and weekly so check out the website for their latest courses. Govindas is such a satisfying meal to have, healthy and filling. Try it out, you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

To see how it is done old-school style I should say.  Mostly on and sometimes off over their 30 years in business, overall this place is an absolute gem.

Such a shame that what seems like a basic way to run a business has for the most part become buried in the vulgarity of preciousness and self-promotion as though that is somehow superior to being real people serving real food.

Govindas is not the above but it IS real, freshly made, often organic deliciousness prepared and served by nice, un-pretentious humans, seemingly without agenda, pretense or up selling.  It is a small place with a casual atmosphere gently reminding to serve yourself a couple portions but please leave some for others.  Govindas staff of quietly humble yet 
confident-in-their-abilities folks are spot on--a refreshing buoy in an increasingly crowded sea of mediocrity.  

Govindas serves delicious Indian-influenced vegetarian fare with varying vegan, gluten and dairy free options.  It is a small buffet (based on availability and season) with add-on treats like gluten-free dessert (we chose the not-too-sweet banana cake with walnut sprinkled chocolate frosting, a gf choco-chip cookie and chai tea--all just-made excellent.  Having been on many sides of the striving to keep it healthy but still desiring flavor food coin over many years, these guys are doing it right.  I imagine anyone, any age from any walk of life eating here and enjoying themselves and most often that is the crowd.  

In the past I may have deducted a star for the interior being the other side of something but I forgot that nonsense after my second recent and equally satisfying visit.  Bottom line, with food this good who cares about the color of the walls or the hippie-meets-grandma-ish-ness?  In hindsight it only added to the positive experience often found when one looks beyond a snap first impression.

Also I have to throw them a bone so-to-speak (not a real bone of course) as I came here often a few years back and it was not nearly as clean or as pleasantly well run as it is today, nor was the food quite this tasty so I applaud the owners wholeheartedly.  

My only concern is that the food sometimes is not very hot temp-wise so by the time you leave the buffet line and sit down you are sometimes eating just barely hot to quickly lukewarm food.  We all know that is walking a fine line.  Hopefully this will be will be handled soon as I noticed it was mentioned in another review. 

Eating here definitely makes eating out and keeping it healthy much more enjoyable.  It seems there is a dearth of honestly fresh, flavorful chemical and additive-free places in our supposedly health-aware Denver so entrepreneurs please take note.

Seriously, anyone can make franken-food stand up, dance and fool us into thinking the price of admission is a good idea at the time, but clutching a roll of TUMS and looking back, it never really is.

The true art and craft of solid home-style cooking usually stays hidden in tiny places like this.  Enjoy."

Connected to the Krsna temple. I loved the veggie selection at the salad bar; full of beets, zucchini and vegan dressings. The indian food is good too, but note that it is Krsna Consciousness cooking so they don&#39;t use flavors that excite passion such as onion and garlic. The food may be a little more bland than you are expecting. Nevertheless, it is organic, home cooked, vegan friendly food served by some very loving individuals. Beautiful artwork!"

The food was fantastic.  Kind of reminded me of Kalachandji&#39;s in Dallas, TX.  We had a salad to start and then a platter of veggie curry with a delicious soup.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a fresh, healthy and extremely tasty meal.

My family and I chose to have dinner at  Govinda&#39;s for my son&#39;s birthday.  We were really looking forward to enchiladas, it was featured on the website as their main dish on that particular evening. First off, they didn&#39;t have the enchiladas we were anticipating and it was substituted with &#34;bbq&#34; tofu, which actually tasted like tofu in marinara sauce, and not very appetizing both in look and taste.
The atmosphere was, well...let&#39;s just say not the happiest. 

We arrived and chose to sit in the dining area outside, and instantly felt unwelcome. The &#34;locals&#34; seated in the area seemed dismayed that a group made up of mostly black people were seemingly &#34;invading&#34; their space. They were literally staring at us as we  attempted to enjoy our meal. My wife and I have had great experiences in many restaurants in the Denver Metro and outlying areas,  I&#39;ve lived in Colorado for nearly 40 years and I&#39;ve never felt so put upon as I did that evening; you could slice the tension with a knife. I really tried to make the best of it, I really did. It was VERY awkward. I attempted to just blow it off, pay the bill, and we were gone. The next day (father&#39;s day) my youngest teenage son shared his experience which reflected my own, and my wife&#39;s! I won&#39;t be going back, that&#39;s for certain. This allegedly &#34;spiritual&#34; place felt cold and uninviting. My suggestion: unless you look like you are part of &#34;that group&#34;, don&#39;t bother. Btw, the food was just...not all that great."

I came in kind of late at 8 and there was still plenty of fresh delicious food for me to enjoy. Everything was vegan when I went, which apparently is the usual - every once in awhile there will be a dairy option very clearly labeled. 

This is such a deal, as well. I think 12.95 for an all you can eat vegan buffet in Denver is pretty solid. Also, there is no tofu to be found! Awesome! It&#39;s like home cooking...if you were raised on delicious potato and carrot veggie balls. I also found everything to be appropriately seasoned. I enjoyed everything I ate!

I don&#39;t go to the temple so some of the atmosphere was a little out of my element but in the end makes me want to go back! Just be prepared to be welcomed! Which is an unexpected but lovely change of pace to a lot of lackluster service that surrounds vegetarian restaurants in the area. I&#39;m totally down to embrace humans embracing other humans! 

Only reason why it&#39;s down to four stars is because I was confused about the bussing situation and if I go to up to pay or if I just sit down and wait etc. In case you&#39;re new too, I think they bus, and you go up to pay, there is a pitcher of water by the desserts. : )"

Greeted at the door by wait staff and the lady who I believe may be the owner. We we told it&#39;s a buffet and were shown the menu written nearly on the chalkboard wall. Each item was explained to us and whether it was vegan or vegetarian. The choices were plentiful and oh so colorful.  Kind of like a production line- take a tray, get a plate and salad bowl and fill up with deliciousness!!
We were invited to take a seat anywhere we liked and offered home made hot chai tea which we gratefully accepted.
Thankfully we arrived when the doors opened at 5:30 on a Friday night- the place filled up really quick. I&#39;m not sure if the other patrons there were regulars or not but everyone was greeted warmly like they were part of a family- the same greeting we received.
I would highly recommend this place for people looking for inexpensive quality food. It&#39;s a very casual atmosphere so you can turn up in sweats if you want to, but try to look a little more impressive than that. These people love what they do- it shows in the food they create and the way the treat their customers. Looking forward to more visits at Govindas!"

Soon thereafter it shut down, and so I was excited to see its recent return. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t worth the wait. The original restaurant offered a tasty, varied, and fresh selection of food, while the new place had a small range of uninteresting foods that were bland, lukewarm, and greasy. The new owners need to pick up their game as no longer is this a by &#34;donation&#34; restaurant. Instead it&#39;s fixed price, more expensive, and with &#34;a la carte&#34; dishes as extras. I have raved about the place to friends and when I took them along I was embarrassed by how poor the new restaurant is in comparison.

I got a bland ( but good quality beef) a fried egg (ok my fault I should have specified a over easy egg since every other gourmet place in the US knows this) and the most crunchy single piece of cooked 4 hours ago bacon 99 cents can buy. After some salt and pepper from the table.  I can honestly say it wasn&#39;t bad and if it was a dollar or two cheaper it would be worth it..  . For for the premium price you pay ..

In trying to expand where I go for lunch, so I decided to head over and check it out after looking at their website and seeing how tasty it looked.

I liked the setting right away when I walked in-a kind of clever mashup of classic 50s diners and modern style. There&#39;s a jukebox with CDs and an old fashioned burger counter, but the tables and booths and other decorations are more modern.

I ordered the Fat Combo, which is their single patty burger with fries and a drink-I went with the fat fries, as I love steak fries. The fact that they offered them made me already like the place a little bit.

My order came up in good time-they cook it to order, so it&#39;s a bit of a wait but no more than 5-7 minutes, I&#39;d say. I was starving so I tried some fries as I drove back to work and was impressed right away-they were the perfect balance between soft and crispy, and not overloaded with salt.

When I unwrapped the burger, it wasn&#39;t &#34;fat&#34; by any means, but really, when does a burger actually look like it does in those pretty pictures? I thought it tasted really good, and was a little greasy but not to the point where the bun was soggy.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed Fatburger-awesome fries, good burger, cool atmosphere. It&#39;s a little pricier than other places so I won&#39;t go that often, but I&#39;ll definitely be back."

Nothing out of the ordinary, standard order at the counter and we&#39;ll bring you your food place.  Be careful and peruse the menu carefully, your burger comes with a standard list of ingredients no matter what.  With that said I ordered the original fat burger with no pickles and no mustard.  The bun was a bit disappointing, standard bun bought for $1.99 at the supermarket.  If you do burgers I think you should really a put a little extra to find a top notch bun since that is a big part of a good burger.  Bun not soggy pretty quick.  Can anyone tell me why relish and pickles are both standard ingredients that automatically come on your burger?  They&#39;re the same thing, chopped up pickles and then slices of pickles.  Weird!

The fries are big steak fries, they were good.  Not my favorite cut for the fry but I&#39;ll take it.  This is a solid burger joint but not something I would go out of the way for.  The burger was okay and so were the fries.  Nothing to write home about.  Burger competition is tough in Denver, and if the quality does not increase I don&#39;t think this place will survive."

The Good - Size choices, if you don&#39;t want a whole huge, big-as-your-head style burger you can get the &#34;Baby Fat&#34;.  Fries - skinny or fat, that&#39;s a nice choice.  The fat fries are like the steak fries you&#39;d get in a steak house.  The skinny are, well... skinny.  The choices of condiments is what makes this place great.  Bacon, a fried egg, chopped onion, it goes on for a full page, the ways you can modify your basic burger.  Shakes - they have decent milkshakes like you&#39;d expect in this throwback environment.  

Why only three stars?  The Bad - The counter guy was mildly snarky with me.  The actual counter was dirty.  My burger temp was wrong.  

I don&#39;t expect counter service people to be constantly blowing a load of sunshine up my kilt, but I also don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m dragging them away from a really compelling episode of Jeopardy! or a text conversation with the ex.  

Please - clean the counters, tables, and any surfaces.  You got time to lean?  You got time to clean!   

On the Burger temp issue - this is a big deal if you are claiming to be a burger boutique.  I&#39;ll probably eat here again, but I may have to send it back if the temp is wrong again.

Generally not bad.  I would recommend  Fat Burger, if you aren&#39;t totally sick of Boutique Burger bars at this point."

Perhaps I have a high standard, but I found the burger I enjoyed today to be a little on the bland side. Maybe it was just an off day, because people tend to rave about the Fatburger and the fries and the shakes. (I had half my order of &#34;fat&#34; fries and a diet coke.) For less than $10, I thought it was a pretty good deal for lunch or dinner.

I also don&#39;t understand why it takes so long for people to order here. They have only a few basic choices - meat/turkey/chicken/veggie and how large and what toppings. It&#39;s not rocket science, people!

The burger was plenty messy and the fries sopped up a big puddle of ketchup. It was ten times better than anything I&#39;ve ever gotten at BK or McD&#39;s, but it still didn&#39;t live up to the spectacular reputation. Perhaps the single slice of melted cheese wasn&#39;t enough. Or maybe it needed the bacon and fried egg.

I realized it was 2 in the afternoon and I hadn&#39;t eaten yet!  So, in an effort to not trash my kitchen and pure laziness, I got in my car and started driving.  I ended up at Fatburger.

I walked in to a new age diner style atmosphere, jukebox and all.  I walked up to the counter and ordered a turkey burger with bacon &amp; cheese.  They do not have any burgers that come with cheese or bacon.  They have different types of patties that come with basic burger essentials like onion, mayo, pickle, etc... you have to pay extra if you want cheese, bacon, a fried egg, etc... 

I got a combo meal, to go.  The man at the counter suggested fat fries (instead of skinny ones) so that&#39;s what I got.  The total was nearly $11!  That was a bit too much... I probably could have gone next door to Chili&#39;s and gotten a burger for less.

When I got home, I tore into it!  The burger, was very tasty!  I really enjoyed it!  The fries, were just OK.  They were limp, mealy and not crispy whatsoever... a sad disappointment.

I probably won&#39;t be back, but who knows.  The atmosphere was good and the burger was really good.  However, I could get a burger of equal caliber with better fries elsewhere for less money.  I almost gave the place 3 stars, but due to the value and the soggy fries with no crisp to them at all... it gets a very strong 2 stars."

Fatburger is the kind of place where you can sit at the counter and watch the cooks make your food - there is something comforting about being able to watch my food get made and not have to wonder what goes on in a back kitchen. 

The food is fresh and made-to-order; that means you&#39;ll wait longer than at a fast food place, but 10 minutes for fresh food is not bad.  And the staff is very helpful; last time I ordered, they told me that it would take 11 minutes to cook my burger and he was right on.  

I talked to the manager and he said that Fatburger recently underwent an ownership change - to me, this is a good thing!  The place is clean, the employees are nice, they recently added outdoor seating and umbrellas (great patio).  Great customer service!  I had been there a couple times under the old ownership, and it&#39;s much improved.  If you haven&#39;t been in a while or had a bad previous experience, but still liked the food, I recommend trying again.

My favorites are the skinny fries, onion rings (HANDMADE in the store - they are sooo good!), and the handmade shakes.  The Baby Fat is the right size burger for me, which is nice to have that option.  The food is your all-American burger joint food, just fresher; don&#39;t come here looking for designer burgers.

Definitely the best burger joint in the neighborhood."

Your burger choices include veggie burgers and turkey burgers for slightly healthier options. If your nutritional choices veer in the other direction, you can add another patty, bacon, chili or an egg to your burger. The number of toppings that come on the burger is overwhelming. The meat itself is juicy and incredibly delicious. If they aren&#39;t hand-spanked, they sure taste like it. 

The sides also offer some delicious choices. Fries (close to steak fries in shape and size), skinny fries and some very delicious onion rings. Not enough choices for you yet? Go ahead and add chili and/or cheese to your fries while you are at it. 

I disagree that this is fast food. You place your order and you have a seat. About 10 minutes later your food is brought out to you. This to me is not fast food. But in my opinion, that&#39;s a good thing."

My husband and I and a group of friends met here one Friday evening. For 7 p.m. on a Friday, it sure wasn&#39;t very busy. I like their size selection, because the &#34;Baby Fat&#34; is just the right size for me. My husband ordered their featured BBQ burger, and everyone else had the original Fat burger. When we received our burgers....well I was unimpressed. The burger was so cold that the cheese hadn&#39;t even melted. The cheese was cold! The lettuce was wilted and soft, and the fries tasted like something i&#39;ve bought in the freezer section at the grocery store. My husband&#39;s BBQ burger had chewy bacon (about the worst thing to happen to bacon), and about a teaspoon of BBQ sauce.

What happened Fat Burger? I thought you were delicious the last time I was here (albeit 2 years ago).

I&#39;ve never heard of the place until my co-workers decided to drag me here one day for lunch.  I come from the land of Ice and Snow, not a mecca of food joints where you can find any kind of food cooked any kind of way... very interesting concept if you ask me!

Anyways, I think I prefer Smashburger&#39;s burgers better, but Whose to tell after only one visit! I want to come back ecept all the locations are out of my way.  I guess I&#39;ll have to wait until I get dragged back.
I just had the classic Fatburger with cheese and fries, which were very good.  The fries weren&#39;t anything special, but still very delightful.  I enjoyed the food.  The lemonade was great; much better than Tropicana which seems like you get everywhere else that has a fountain.  I did appreciate that, however I didn&#39;t really care for the 20 people who were already ahead of me in line.  Even with two people on the registers, the line still took a while to get through.

Overall, the experience was just fine."

Fatburger makes an OK burger but nothing super spectacular that keeps me coming back.  I seem to be choosing other burger places over Fatburger more and more.  I prefer 5 guys a little bit more, the burger is about the same, but the fries at 5 guys put em over the top.

I am more of an ice cream and shake fanatic and I do like their shakes.  I would have to say that a big ole vanilla shake is probably my favorite part of eating at Fatburger."

I try to do my best when it comes to Yelping, so there we sat ... fat and happy with a belly full of burger and some seriously awesome steak fries. 

We waltzed in around noonish ...actually 12:01 and I was feeling the slightest trepidation about our timing ... like would the entire city of Aurora be wanting them a burger too, was I not the only devoted Yelper around? As it turned out I was in the clear, as the system here was smooth as silk and the very nice man behind the counter was willing to walk me through my first ( but not  last) Fat Burger order. It was a bit pricey .. not so much for the burgers and fries and such ...but $2.09 for a medium drink???? Really ...? Wowie! This is really the only thing on their menu I thought to have a crazy price. I am willing to overlook it though, want to know why??? 

Because I loved my burger that&#39;s why ... I loved the stuff they put on it and the relish, although sweetish ( I normally prefer non sweet) it added just the perfect zing and tang and the other stuff all contributed to a yummy, satisfying, authentic burger! Whoo Hoo! I really have to say there are few things I find more enjoyable than a simple, quality burger. I had just this at Fat Burger. Sammie had the crispy chicken sandwich, she claims it to have been flavorful and just crispy enough. All I know is, it was GONE! Jess opted for a hot dog, J loves her some hot dogs ... it was even more gone than the chicken, nice and plump and juicy! Going, going, gone ...was our entire meal. I love steak fries! The steak fries I encountered today were ....wait for it .... wait for it ....PERFECTION! I will dream of them, and ketchup and salt too! I may have figured out my next tattoo ...steak fries ... well OK ...maybe not. 

We are sooo gonna be repeat customers ...just as soon as I find all my elastic waistband pants .... they are sooo coming back in style. I kid you not!"

The atmosphere and service reminds me of Chipotle and that&#39;s positive because it&#39;s a little cleaner and a little less shady then most &#39;fast food&#39; places.  The people working there probably are paid a little more because they are not rude and they don&#39;t make mistakes often because they confirm your order.

And let&#39;s be honest, Aurora&#39;s in the ghetto, and We WERE at the mall after all.  Prices are on the high side ($6.99 for a Fatburger with fries//$7.99 for a King Fat Burger) but the food is made to order...it took about 12 minutes from start to finish.  And they even had soy burgers!

Lately this burger place has really gone down hill. Today we went in and our experience was terrible. In our opinion the place has really gone downhill fast. I would not recommend it to anyone. We ordered a simple Boca Burger and fries. They totally forgot to give us our fries. We had to go back and get the fries. They gave us no ketchup. We had to go back to get that which was in little ketchup packets you have to individually open and squeeze out. Many of the tables were unclean and I had to wipe down a table so we would have a place to sit.  The mayonnaise they gave with the burger, in a tiny white cup, was very liquid, runny, almost as if it had been watered down--strangest mayonnaise I&#39;ve ever seen. The order of fries was much smaller than we used to get at this same location. I get the impression this place has changed ownership, though I don&#39;t know for sure.

Sandwiches were very good, but the rice paper wrapping for the Spring/summer Rolls was unpleasantly hard. They were not sufficiently softened when the rolls were being made &amp; don&#39;t endure refrigeration well. Marinated Sirloin with Grilled Asparagus was nice except the Wild Rice was also unpleasantly toothy.

A very upbeat and sweet woman personally greets you and leads you through the salad bar. She tells you what the most popular salads are and then asks what business you&#39;re in. You tell her, and as you make your selection she comments that such people are always trying to protect their girlish figure (I&#39;m a 64 year old white guy who needs to lose 10 lbs, so I really am scratching my head about what that meant:). 

Nonetheless, you buy your salad and find that it&#39;s filled with all kinds of good stuff (glazed salmon, quinoa, fresh raspberries, sunflower seeds, mixed baby greens, goat cheese and a side of citrus vinaigrette dressing. The cost with tax is $12.95. 

But surprise. I wasn&#39;t at Whole Foods. I was at the new Go Bistro down on 11th and Broadway. So why did I lead you down that path . . .?

Because the next day I actually went to my regular Whole Foods and bought roughly the equivalent of the above salad. There was no upbeat and sweet woman taking me through a tour of the salad bar. No one commented on my figure--girlish or otherwise. The checkout person was a nice hipster who simply inquired, &#34;Did you find everything you needed?&#34; and I was in and out in just a bit more time than it took me to go through Go Bistro the day before.

The difference? About $4 saved at WF but arguably a tad better quality at Go Bistro. So why buy from Go Bistro and not WF? Well . . . Go Bistro apparently is setting up a presence at several local gyms and other lunch-centric spots where customers might indeed find it very convenient to be able to buy a delicious and fresh to-go salad (or sandwiches of various types). 

Good marketing niche? You bet. Worth it? Absolutely, if you happen to be within grabbing distance of one of Go Bistro&#39;s outlets. Worth making the special drive on over to Go Bistro instead of saving some bucks and going to Whole Foods? No.

Bottom line: Go Bistro provides a handy alternative to making your own grab-and-go salad at WF but if you have to make a special stop for it, in my book not worth it.

I was so excited to find a place that delivers healthy, delicious food on eat24.com. I spent the 1 hour wait time day dreaming about the freshly freshly prepared salad that was coming my way! 

The bike messenger finally arrived and pulled out a beautifully stamped bag with a couple of small disappointments inside. 

The portions for the sides are great, but my main salad was hardly any bigger. To be precise, there were only 13 leaves of greens.... In a salad. [The salad I ordered only comes in what I&#39;ll call the medium. But still not enough green for this lady!] The flavors were good for a salad, but just not enough of it. Lucky me I&#39;d broken down while waiting and ate a granola bar, or else I&#39;d have to go get more food.

The side beet salad also tasted good, but had some serious flaws. My colleague&#39;s did not have berries and came with a different sauce (maybe it was the one for my salad, we guessed), and while mine had berries, one of them was growing fur. Yum! I&#39;m not squeamish so I just lobbed off the bad half and ate it anyways. [Again, the owner apologized for the mess up, and the fur was on the inside rim, so if they were busy it would be easy to miss. Apology accepted!].

I&#39;m guessing this place grew too fast or the owner is out of town. Hope they figure things out. [Obviously she&#39;s there, and just really busy. I trust she&#39;s going to pay better attention now]

[I will also add, the food is tasty and healthy, and the dressings on the tarter side. If there was more lettuce (I love lettuce, a lot!) I&#39;d be a die-hard fan.]"

I was craving Greek food and decided to order the chicken gyro, which might&#39;ve been a mistake. I&#39;ve never actually had a chicken gyro before so that could potentially be my problem, but I just found the meat extremely dry and the bread pretty flavorless. There was the usual yogurt sauce accompanying it, which wasn&#39;t that great. It added some flavor overall, but didn&#39;t pull the whole thing together. 
On the side, I had the chicken, rice, and lemon soup, which I did really enjoy. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever tried anything quite like it, and I&#39;m still at loss as to how to describe it. 
As far as interior design and ambiance goes, I have no complaints. After ordering at the counter, I sat outside. There was a nice little planter box with some cool botanicals growing. The wait staff was kind, though it did take some time for our food to arrive. I didn&#39;t particularly mind waiting, but fair warning if you&#39;re going in hungry."

I told him I was impressed with his logo, the website, etc, and thought that it was a chain because of that.  It looked very professional.  He told me he had been in the restaurant business for 25 years, so he had a lot of experience.  

Food was good, I had a Gyro salad.  My friend who joined me had the Greek salad.  There was a few more people who came in an ordered Calzones, which also looked and smelled amazing.  I am definitely planning on going back.

They do most of their business (90%) with take out and delivery.  I won&#39;t hesitate to call them to my neighborhood if I ever want to get delivery.

They have a smaller dining area, not good for huge groups, and a small patio area on the side as well, which would be great on a nice warm day.

Two minor complaints - the tzatziki sauce is bright and fresh tasting, but a little too heavy on the sour cream and not enough cucumber flavor.  And the gyro sandwich doesn&#39;t come with feta (may be optional, but I always forget to ask)."

Hey, if the young man serving you was good, please be courteous and leave him a few bucks. It&#39;s the right thing to do. P.S. No beer or alcohol served, as of yet anyway."

  They are a delivery place and while I was there more delivery was going out than actual customers coming in. 

  I would recommend this place. The Greek food is well prepared. Good pizza&#39;s and sandwiches. The Gyro Plater was fabulous. 

  They even offer desserts in the refrigerator area."

I wanted pizza, but didn&#39;t want to wait that long, so I settled for the gyro plate.

The food came out in about 10 minutes. It was amazing. The thin pita was light and had a crispy exterior with a soft inside, which gave it a good bite and taste. The gyro looks like it was regrilled after it was cut - some sides were extra crispy and there were some nice thick pieces, all with good flavor. Vegetables were string beans sautéed with tomatoes and added a good balance needed for the meal. Finally, the rice was soft and also balanced out a great meal. 

The portions were big - the meal included a side salad and a soup. I finished the salad, but only drank half the soup. Both were good, but I was too full and busy enjoying the main course! 

Meanwhile during our meal, these guys at another table were eating the pizza. It looked so good and I was sad that I didn&#39;t get a chance to try it. Will definitely come back to try the pizza another time!"

I randomly stopped here one day in need of a quick dinner - and the food was delicious!

Spanakopita - phyllo was nicely browned on the outside, but just a touch undercooked inside. 

Dolamades entree - huge portion that came with salad and soup. Interesting tomato beans on the side. I enjoyed it all!

Service was super attentive as well - much more than what you would expect from an order-at-the-counter place. Stop here if you get a chance!"

We ordered take-out for pick-up, but they also deliver!  It took about 30 minutes to have pick-up ready from the time food was ordered online. 
We ordered the Greek burger and the Gyro Sandwich, both accompanied with fries, with plenty of oregano seasoning. The gyro meat itself was slightly on the dry side, but overall the BF enjoyed his meal but dressed in his own homemade donair sauce. I ordered the Greek burger, which is huge. Since the BF did not care for his tzatziki sauce that accompanied his gyro sandwich, I used the sauce to add more flavor to my burger - it was juicy and very tasty.  Also, as a nice surprise, a pickle with the sandwich meals - I LOVE PICKLES, but the BF does not, so I got TWO pickles all for me!! 
The restaurant itself is modest in size and clean. Overall, the food is good and tasty, so the BF and I will be back to try other dishes."

My wife had been trying to convince me to try Bada Bing for months. Maybe it was the name, but I just wasn&#39;t that excited to do so. We finally went a few weeks ago and my mind was changed immediately. The restaurant itself is no-frills and in a somewhat odd location (ground floor of an office building), but the staff makes you feel very welcomed right away.

I had a bacon cheeseburger (wasn&#39;t in the mood for Greek or Italian - their specialties), my son a slice of pizza and my wife a gyro. It takes a pretty darn good burger for me to notice and this was. The pizza - NY style - was likewise very tasty (dad perk - I finished what my 2-year-old son didn&#39;t) and I really like their sauce. My wife said her gyro was one of the best she&#39;d ever had.

We haven&#39;t been back since that visit, but we have ordered delivery and they rocked it! We live in west Arvada, away from most other delivery options, but Bada Bing thankfully still serves our neighborhood (with a $2.50 surcharge). This time we just ordered a pizza and a gyro and both arrived piping hot and fresh.

It&#39;s tough for a restaurant that serves fairly common fare (thinking about the pizza here) to set themselves apart.  I can say that Bada Bing does so and deserves their excellent rating on Yelp.  If you try them, I&#39;d be surprised if you left disappointed."

The gyro was a good size, meat was flavorful and good mix of tender and crispy pieces with we both liked and the sauce was amazing! His burger was absolutely delicious the spinach and feta combo is awesome and will probably be what I get next time. His only note was that the burger bun was a little greasy but as we had ordered it for delivery it is understandable, might order the bun in a separate container next time perhaps.

Tonight my husband had the gyro and fries. He said they were good...not great. 
I had the chicken bacon and Swiss with fries. Good also

The fries are Greek fries. Loaded with oregano. Different but good. Love that the sandwich comes with a pickle. :-) 

I also got a cup of their avgolemono soup. traditional Greek soup. (Chicken and rice). 
What I found interesting was the sandwich and the fries had plenty of seasoning yet the soup severely lacked seasoning. Maybe that&#39;s the nature of the soup I&#39;m not sure. 
I added salt pepper and oregano to match my fires. Not sure if they started with a trinity but the soup was flat. 

We will try the pizza next time. We need a good pizza place in Arvada. Wasn&#39;t impressed with Abos. The search continues."

We needed takeout while getting ready to head downtown to some bars for the evening. were in the mood for something semi-healthy (is takeout ever really healthy?). I soooo glad we chose this place and can&#39;t wait to go eat in the restaurant. I ordered the grilled chicken plate, my friend ordered the souvlaki plate. We ordered dolmades(stuffed grape leaves) and pita with a side of tzatziki. Um. Yum. And sooooo much food. The chicken was a tad dry, but come on, I ordered grilled chicken.... Slightly dry when getting that from takeout- is probably as good as it gets, no matter where you order from. The rice was good. The veggies- not my favorite. Buuuutttt- the pita: soft and warm. And the tzatziki: great flavor. And the grape leaves: perfectly stuffed with meat and rice. And the soup: still not sure what kind it was, but yum. It also came with a salad - it was your standard American salad make Mediterranean by adding olives and feta. It was fresh and I enjoyed it. My friend also enjoyed her souvlaki - everything else was the same as my meal. To top it off, the stag was super friendly and seemed to be enjoying themselves. Will definitely make it back."

Had a Greek Pizza, the avgolemono soup, salad and a traditional lamb dish (that they decided to make with pork). The problem(s)?

If I am spending $15 a head for dinner, I expect better than soggy paper plates, plastic utensils so crappy the broke on my pork dish, paper Coca Cola cups, a to-go box for the pizza that was too small and you  had to pile the slices atop of each other, and a/c that was so weak it had to be 90 degrees in the place. 

So - for take out, which may be their focus - OK. Sit down? Forgetta &#39;bout it. Finally, I am originally from NJ, a Soprano&#39;s fan - why name a restaurant after a strip joint?"

Ordered the bruschetta, spanakopita, spanakopizza, &amp; Italian sausage sandwich with chips. Taste-wise, everything was pretty good; the bruschetta was a little different than I expected in terms of texture (large slices of bread rather than small pieces), &amp; not as crispy, but tasted good. I didn&#39;t try the spanakopita, but my mom did and said it was a little dry but that the dough was good. I really enjoyed my pizza - the crust was good, and the taste was good. My dad also said his sandwich was good, &amp; we all really liked the chips.

Service-wise, could use some improvement. There was a mixup with the delivery guys grabbing our pizza by mistake so we had to wait double the time so they could remake it - the cashier was friendly accommodating &amp; gave us dessert for free &amp; a coupon for the next time. We appreciated that. Though we had to wait quite a while, this made it better. What I didn&#39;t appreciate was the fact that a.) even though we were waiting for a long time, the bruschetta was not ready when the pizza was done, &amp; b.) I specifically ordered my bruschetta without olives &amp; rather than re-making it, one of the employees brought it to the back where the olives were picked out (I know because I saw it come from the grill with olives, go &#39;mysteriously&#39; to the back room, then come back without olives, not to mention some were still on it when I got home... perhaps that was because they didn&#39;t want to make us wait any longer, but as a courtesy thing in the future, please just remake the food to customer specifications.

Like I said, however, I did enjoy my pizza, &amp; would come back here again for that. Hoping the service will be better next time so I can increase my rating."

The first time, we ordered around supper time online and about an hour and a half later we were finally were contacted by a delivery driver who couldn&#39;t locate our residence despite instructions as to the location.   Fair enough, the neighborhood was new and they were incredibly apologetic.

The second order, we placed a pizza order directly.     It was reasonably good, but arrived lukewarm.   Popped it in the microwave, and enjoyed.    If I had reviewed this location based on this order alone, I would have given it 3, perhaps 3.5 stars.

Third order, ordered a gyro pie online around 6:20, online service calls us around 7:30 to tell us they&#39;d just been notified by the restaurant that they were out of what we&#39;d ordered and that we should call them to order something else.

There have been a few other restaurants at this location - it&#39;s somewhat difficult to find. It&#39;s located in Arvada just west of Ward on 58th. We have been very impressed with the food, the service, and the owner (Paul) and his staff. The atmosphere is ok somewhat like a deli. We preferred to eat outside on the patio.  We had the Greek soup and thought it was very good ( I make my own and this was very similar). We had a Gyro plate and it was excellent the vegetables were hot and tasty.

If so, read no further, give the Uber driver the address, and head this way. That&#39;s the only reason I&#39;ve ever ended up at a Sliceworks, and I have yet to regret the decision. I&#39;m sure my late night pizza stops have even helped temper a hangover or two.

My only experience is with their by-the-slice menu and late on a weekend evening after being out brewery hopping. For that scenario, this place hits the nail on the head. They do get a line, but it moves fairly quickly. They have all of their pizzas out behind the glass counter with the names of each one in front of it. You just tell the guys behind the counter what you want, they grab a slice and put it in the oven, and by the time you have paid at the register it is piping hot and ready to be devoured.

They have a lot of &#34;gourmet&#34; pizzas that vary from the norm. From baked potato, to green chili, to bacon cheeseburger, and even clam pizza, they have a wide variety of interesting things to choose from. It&#39;s thin crust pizza, and as mentioned before, it&#39;s baked and then reheated when it is ordered if you are getting it by the slice. That being said, the pizzas turn over quick enough in the evening that they are likely still hot from coming out of the oven anyway. I think they taste great, but some are certainly more greasy than I would prefer. The unique toppings are more a draw for me than the pizza itself. It&#39;s not what I would call high quality in the world of pizza.

The prices are why this won&#39;t get a 5 star rating from. The convenience of the by-the-slice offering is nice, but they charge way too much. I checked my memory against their online menu, and can confirm it is $4.25 for a slice of their unique pizzas that I mentioned earlier. They are big, but that seems too high for being a place that you order at the counter and get reheated pizza served on paper plates. If you are looking for value in a pizza, this definitely isn&#39;t the place to get it.

The service certainly helps make up for the overly-inflated prices, though. The people working are always extremely nice and fun, especially for the hectic atmosphere and the constant line of drunk people that they have to deal with. 

I find it hard to believe there won&#39;t be another night in Denver when I have had a drink or two more than I should have and make the request for Sliceworks, so it has earned 4 stars from me."
sliceworks-denver-2,Paul V.,OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg,"Dallas, TX",1,1,1,336,33,fpYRL5HjkwfeUrFcHvb2Dg,3.0,2016-09-11,"The &#39;heat a slice&#39; pizza market is often a difficult one to differentiate within, but Denver&#39;s own Sliceworks has carved out a local following that&#39;s sure to eventually be replicated both inside and out of Denver city limits. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

The logistics at Sliceworks are no different from what you&#39;ve no doubt seen hundreds of times before: pick your slices, they&#39;re heated up, and away you go. The selection is impressive, with nearly a dozen or so options spanning traditional and contemporary. While you do tend to get the drunk and loud crowd around closing time, would it really be a proper pizza by the slice spot if you didn&#39;t? Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

By some sort of juju, the price of pizza by the slice has skyrocketed over the past few years, with local spots not unlike Sliceworks (Sizzle Pie in Portland, 2 Bros in NYC, etc.) charging in excess of $3.00 for a single slice of pie. Sliceworks is in line with this pricepoint, charging on average $3.00 for a slice (and up to $4.00 for some). That&#39;s high, but it&#39;s not unreasonable relatively speaking. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

I had a (very large) slice of Chicken Veggie and another of Grandma&#39;s old fashioned square cut. Both were good, with perfectly acceptable crust, toppings, ratios, and flavor, but neither of my slices really blew me away given how high the bar has been set with an ever expanding list of premium crusts and toppings in Denver and elsewhere. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Sliceworks has cornered a nice little market, but with competition in Denver like Five Points, Blue Pan, and Ian&#39;s, I can&#39;t say Sliceworks is my favorite. No Star Granted."

For a little over $4 for a slice of pizza, we thought that was pushing it for one slice. We decided to order a whole pizza which ended up being too much for two people. The works pizza which had everything on it was absolutely soggy when it came out. There were too many toppings just tossed on top of the pizza that some of it didn&#39;t even look cooked and it weighed the pizza down.  Toppings would be slipping right off as you lifted up a slice.

We checked in to get the free garlic knots but those just tasted exactly like the pizza crust with garlic thrown on top. 

Maybe the other items on the menu would have faired better, but The Works pizza had me feeling physically sick for a few hours after eating it. :("

Same goes for Sliceworks in that they have some good ideas but they were a little too greasy to really hit the mark.

I got two slices, the stuffed meat and the alla vodka. Let&#39;s start with the stuffed meat ... it looked amazing but it was a giant clump of grease to the point where I couldn&#39;t even finish it all. The alla vodka slice on the other hand was quite tasty and enjoyable and really saved the experience.

I appreciated the marinara and the portion sizes were good but just a little too greasy for me."

Great find if you ask me. Tasty selection and innovative creations make this place a must try whether you&#39;re a junk food addict or a health nut. Try the cheeseburger pizza along w the vodka slices. The stuffed pizzas are legit and you cannot ever pass on the garlic knots. Healthy portions and great flavor. Total believer and converted many of my pizza snob buddies over to the dark side called Sliceworks when they visit.

I got the Pizza Alla Vodka, and it was one of the most unique pizzas I&#39;ve ever had. The name was accurate, and it tasted exactly like penne vodka on a pizza. I&#39;m now referring to this pizza as, Cheese Pizza on Steroids. So good, I wish there was a 4.5 star option. 

This is a gem in downtown Denver."

Sliceworks might not have gone quite as far off the deep end as some spots, but the green chili slice was awesome - the baked potato slice also looked greatt.

I think Sliceworks might have the best thin crust of the spots I&#39;ve tried in Denver so far, and their Sicilian was good, if not exemplary. Even with the place being packed they were quick enough to sneak in and out during lunch without worrying about time. Tasty!"

They serve Coke Products, to that in itself warrants two stars minimum.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.
Now for the pizza, it was very good and tasty. I tried the thick style crust, which I am not normally a fan of, but it looked really good. Unfortunately, as I bit into it, I remember why I am not a fan; the crust, which was good, overwhelmed the real taste of the pizza sauce, cheese and toppings, which were good. That is just my taste.  I will be back for a regular size slice to try."

We ordered three huge slices , roughly $4 a  slice, and a soft drink. Dinner for two $15. They cut all our slices in two pieces, and upon bringing our pizza out, one half slice fell on the ground. The staff apologized and came back with an additional full slice cut in two again, so basically we got a half slice for free ( on top of our free samples). That is how business should be done, A+ for Service and experience!

The pizza was New York style, prebaked and reheated, so it was severed hot. We got BBQ chicken, which had a perfect mix of ingredients, and we got vodka sauce pizza, which was fantastic, and a tomato pesto pizza which was rustic and quite flavorful.

I could not choose a favorite slice, they were all exceptional. The quality, price, and experience has won me over, thank you Sliceworks!"

Ordered a pepperoni pizza, a slice of the chicken veggie, four season salad and their garlic knots. I didn&#39;t get to try the pepperoni but my bf and his friend seemed to enjoy it. The chicken veggie slice was delicious and had a good variety of veggies in it like broccoli, scallions, garlic etc. Their four season salad (I added chicken) was a huge portion and was pretty worth it for me; the goat cheese, pears and candied walnuts were a great combo. Their garlic knots were addicting, especially with the marinara sauce it came with.

Maybe because it was 2 am and you can&#39;t beat late night slices, or maybe because the slice was only $3 and was bigger than my face, but this was the best pizza I&#39;ve had in a while. The New York thin style made the crust to topping ratio perfect and it was greasy but not Dominos greasy.

Whoever the genius was that decided to strategically place a pizza shop between the bars and the train deserves a gold star. I would definitely go back, whether it be 2 in the morning or 2 in the afternoon."

But $4 a slice, I feel is pretty excessive.Specially since their toppings aren&#39;t special.

Also, it takes a little longer than imagined to reheat the slice.

I&#39;m not trying to take anything away from these guys, but I think they&#39;re getting too much credit for having that sticker that says they were on that one shitty TV show. And invariably I&#39;m going to compare pizza to pies I&#39;ve had on the east coast. For far less money per slice."

Now, let me preface that perhaps my palette is a bit biased after being born and raised in New York and accustomed to the pizza there, but I was less than impressed with the most of the pizza.  

I&#39;m normally a Sicilian/Grandma/Regular slice consumer when I&#39;m in NY.  I decided to try the Sicilian and a Tomato &amp; Pesto slice, while my wife and children ate regulars.

Sicilian and regulars were mediocre at best.   They&#39;ve been clearly sitting around for some time.  If a pizza place in NY put that stuff out, they&#39;d be closed in short order.  I actually would say that Papa Johns and Pizza Hut regulars taste better.    The tomato and pesto, which had just come out of the oven, was great.

Service was great, place was clean and nicely decorated.  Prices very affordable given the location.

We won&#39;t be eating here again.  I simply wasn&#39;t impressed by the food.  I actually think the pizza on the western slope is better."

It is a very cozy pizza-by-the-slice spot. My slice of pesto pizza and a soda was 7$.  Staff was great. Pizza was awesome. Fresh pesto, thin tomato slices, and dressed beautifully with herbs and olive oil. It came with a free garlic knot and marinara; which may have stolen the show. Delicious. Very fast."

The pizza was great but I must warn you that the combination of Buffalo Sauce on a pizza is quite overpowering and is an acquired taste.

I would encourage you to try one slice before you order a whole pizza! 

The delivery guy was great!

He forgot to bring the complimentary Garlic Knots and made a timely return with the Garlic Knots like he said he would."

Ok.  Tough crowd.

I haven&#39;t been into a Sliceworks location yet, but had it delivered twice.  Both times were very satisfying.  My first round was with their margherita gourmet pizza.  Didn&#39;t scream in ecstasy over this one, but it did delight.  Better yet was my second of a tried and true pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  Also, the order of garlic knots I got with it were delicious.

On top of that, the delivery crew is always courteous and helpful.  One of them even ran to get some change to help me split a twenty.  That&#39;s straight up awesome.  I do not expect such service, but really appreciate that.

I&#39;ve been told that going into a Sliceworks is even better than delivery.  Should I ever be in the area, I will definitely do so.  Consider this a 4.5 until then."

Had the cheese pizza twice, very good both times, as well as the garlic bread and Caesar salad. Pizza was very good. Not too much sauce, which I like. The salad was fresh and the garlic bread was alright.

The only thing that bugged me was that the second time we ordered from Grubhub the delivery guy told my boyfriend his PayPal didn&#39;t go through and to give him cash. So he gave him all he had ($10) and checked his PayPal the next day and what do you know - charged the $20 that he ordered.

They greeted us when we walk in and offered us a small piece of cheese pizza while we were waiting for our food. 

It was a difficult decision on what kind of pizza I wanted but I finally chose the Tomato Pesto and loved every bite. I also had a house salad with a vinaigrette dressing. It tasted very Greek, which I love. My daughter picked the Three cheese, delicious! 

They offer a few different wines and beer as well. Our overall experience was wonderful. We will be back very soon to take the rest of our family. It would be an excellent place to take out of town guests too. It gives a fun downtown feel while enjoying wonderful pizza."

The building Sliceworks is in is very cool, one of those with brick walls and a HIGH ceiling. It wasn&#39;t too difficult to find metered parking. If they don&#39;t appear to have a lot of customers at the shop, they get a lot of delivery calls because the guys seemed a little distracted when taking our order, which we didn&#39;t mind, just pointing out that they&#39;re actually busier than they look. But still very nice is that when you&#39;re deciding on what to get, you&#39;re presented with two sample slices of meatball and pepperoni pizza, it could just save you from being famished! :-D

We had to ask a lot of questions because my friend is vegetarian, she thought for sure she&#39;d like to Green Chile pizza but nope, that has chicken stock in it, I thought it was so interesting! If I come again I&#39;d be getting that (just didn&#39;t want to have it in my friend&#39;s face, lol). She settled with a slice of veggie stuffed pizza, that sucker is a pretty good size (actually everything here is a large portion and will fill you up), she kept on commenting how great the dough was. We had a salad to share and you see things like brined olives and roasted red peppers that are normally not on a plain old house salad. We also got the Spinach Egg Drop Soup, I thought it sounded Chinese, lol. And it even looked like what we would make at home. But whatever cheese they used in the soup, I didn&#39;t quite care for. I found the same flavor on my Tomato Pesto slice. It tasted a little, just a little, like goat cheese, but that&#39;s enough to turn me off. I don&#39;t know why but I also ordered a Chicken Roll, took most of it home because it was the size of my arm! It&#39;s good but not that much greater than Costco&#39;s Chicken Bake. One problem I had was that most of the food was pre-made and needs to be reheated before serving. But it&#39;s difficult to control the oven and a often times the bread feels overcooked. I thought a good dough is ruined when it&#39;s dry like crackers!

There were several guys working that night. Some of the tables were still waiting to be cleaned when we sat down but there were plenty of seatings. They were polite toward customers and helped us quickly whenever we requested something."

The Average:
o  The pizza was good, not great.  A solid 3-stars.
o  I was hoping it would be a bit more crisp coming out of the oven.  Maybe another 60 seconds in there.  I&#39;m guessing I can ask for this specifically, so it&#39;s hard to ding them on this.

I love the ambiance and the food is great. Iv had the pleasure  of meeting  the management but I have had issues with how the waitresses adress the customers. I have only had one waitresses whom was very feed up and catty with her night so ended up leaving us with a sour taste, 

but that&#39;s not where the issue lies. just last week we came in and the table  next to us were very pleasant they had ordered nachos before we had and we got ours first mind you they had ordered  it 2 hours prior. Two more hours had past and yet no nachos, finally it became time to pay out and as the table next to us came to pay the gentleman had explaining in a nice way how they never got the nachos and made a joke, the waitresses took it to far and personal she was very unprofessional and the bartender behind her had heard how upset she was so he screamed at the customer like a dog. 

They threatened him to leave because he asked for there names and numbers to call for a manager which they refused to give. She was nasty and when it came for us to pay she assumed we were with them so she put his tab on our check. 

When we explained that we had only had the table next to them, then she went on talking crap about the customer after they had been asked to leave. Once we were done the gentleman had walked back in to pay for the tab in full but the blonde waitresses had threatened to call the cops, which they did anyway because a officer walked in only a few minutes later as he handed his money. By the way the bartenders had made a joke that he was keeping the change. I never saw the customer get his change. This place would be a 4 star if it weren&#39;t for the blonde waitresses that thought she was above the customer..

First of all, the food is great! Who would expect a pool hall to have an elevated menu?  They have a lot of options, and I never expect much from a tavern salad, but the one I got here was very flavorful!  Plus they were super accommodating regarding my gluten-free needs.

Second, they make great cocktails! They have all these made-in-house infused vodkas, and they will mix them up any way you want!  And I didn&#39;t know what I wanted lol -I just asked for some kindof drink with cucumber and the bar tender made me a moscow mule with their cucumber vodka -YUMMY!

Thirdly, we never got bored!  Plenty of pool tables, some foosball and just an all around fun atmosphere!  The waitress was great -once the bar tender helped me figure out what I was drinking, she kept them coming!  ;)

Great service, great vibe, and great food!  Sure wish this place could relocate to California!!  ;)"

Service has consistently been amazing, and I&#39;ve had a chance to sample some of the items on the menu....wow. Once I went with a friend just to eat and watch the game - not even to play pool! Very large menu, so a huge variety of items - and massive portions.

As I&#39;ve started to learn more about pool - I now also realized how huge it is that they have such a variety of tables. Green felt, blue felt - regulation size and smaller tables - and the staff are all very knowledgable regarding pool as well. I even met some &#34;pool teachers&#34; who have classes there, and was approached about joining a beginners league."

And cheap happy hour next to an outdoor fire pit! +Darts!
Ruben Sandwich and Breakfast burrito are Da Bomb!

This place really never fails... They do a great job with the space and are continuously making upgrades. There are creative to get people in the door and it shows they are really trying to make it a fun place. The music can get a little country - depending on the night....if that&#39;s your thing.

Met a friend here for after work drinks and service was prompt at the bar. I came here a second time the other night and the service was absolutely terrible. The bartenders were only interested in serving their regulars or flirting with drunk women. The bar area was hardly busy, but we couldn&#39;t get anyone to refill our drinks. We were seated at the end of the bar and thought moving to a more central location would help. Nope. The bartender would look to the left and the right of us and ask if they needed anything else and wouldn&#39;t say a thing to us, even though our drinks were empty. Even at the end of the night when we tried to close out our tab we were completely ignored. I&#39;ve never had service this bad at any bar I&#39;ve been too. This bar wasn&#39;t packed, there weren&#39;t a lot of people so there was no reason that we were consistently ignored for the 2 1/2 hours we were there. I&#39;ve been to bars where the bar is just as long and is filled all the way across and is 10 deep and I&#39;ve still had better service there than I did here. 

I added a star simply for their outdoor fire pit. I can&#39;t help but love a fire pit, especially in the winter.

Also, the drink prices were great, but were completely watered down. After drinking 3 I felt absolutely nothing. Bars in Englewood are hard to come by but I would definitely skip this one."

They have numerous Diamond and Gold Crown tables as well as coin op and snooker.  I wish they had one three cushion billiard table, but I also get the economics of space vs. demand.  I have had over a dozen of the specials off the menu and have never been disappointed.  Their Monte Cristo is out of this world and should be put on the menu permanently. The employees are awesome and always greet you with a smile and often address you by name, (Once they get to know you).  If you are competitive, the tournaments are challenging, well run, and always draw the best talent in the area.  Leagues are also available.  In plain English--I&#39;m going to stick with this pool room; you can bank on that.  So give it a go and remember to keep the racks tight and finesse the balls into the pockets."

We were impressed with how clean it was-nice wood floors (no nasty feet-stuck-to-the-floor carpet), the jukebox was stocked with good tunes and the pool tables were maintained nicely.  Unfortunately on this occasion, we were not there to play pool.  

On a mission to get some foodstuffs in our bellies, we ordered some chicken nachos, lettuce wraps and fries.  The nachos weren&#39;t horrible, but I was a sad panda when I looked at the lettuce wraps.  I had scoped them out on the menu earlier that day, so I KNEW I was ordering them...way to set yourself up for failure, Cherie.  They arrived at our table as just a strewn plate of iceberg lettuce (not even in cup form) smothered in a hot chicken mixture.  OK, the point of lettuce wraps is to fill the nice cold, crisp lettuce cups yourself with the hot chicken mixture, so the lettuce is still crisp-not already smothered with the stuff, leaving the lettuce all warm and wilty by the time it reaches your table.  Besides them being completely put together wrong, they just tasted icky.  My friend said her fries were good, at least!

The service was pretty good at first, but once we finished our beers and were ready for our check, our server seemed to have forgotten about us.  Oh well, not enough to keep me from coming back.  If I&#39;m in the neighborhood and feel like playing some pool, I&#39;ll drop by for a few beers and order the food that Vina Y. had...it sounds delicious!"

I visited around 4:30 and my initial impression was just a decent pool hall packed with 25 or so tables.  I decided to try out the tables which were in pretty good shape compared to most pool halls.  The house cues were pretty banged up but I found one that worked very well - finally.  The floors were wooden and very nice as well as the Bose speakers (definite thump and great quality sound).

While waiting for my wife I played a game or two - talked to a couple of local players - and everyone seemed very welcoming.  I found out that Happy Hour really mostly applied to appetizers and pitches of beer - I hoped for some micro-brew deals but overall it&#39;s still great value for most people.

The waitress greeted me immediately but I was waiting on my wife - so I wasn&#39;t ready yet.  This was my mistake because within minutes, a large group came in for poker so I saw the end of excellent service.  I understand how busy they got in such a short period of time but the poker section literally consumed 100% of her time.  I really don&#39;t blame the staff but maybe they could have said &#34;we are very busy and will be with you asap&#34;.  My advice for Felt would be to have your staff ready for the overload before the poker people come in.

Anyhow once a new waitress entered the building, everything got in great shape real fast.  She was a fantastic server and she obviously cared about her job.  She even talked about the cooking staff, food, pool tournaments, league - it was as if she was part owner, very impressed.

Now about the food - I&#39;m not comparing this to typical highly rated restaurants but my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food.  She ordered the chile relleno plate - I had the appetizer beef nachos.  Both were well above our expectations and more food than we could eat.  The chile rellenos were crispy and had a definite kick but very comparable to Los Dos Potrillos (our favorite chile relleno spot).  Normally when I enter a pool hall, I don&#39;t order food unless I&#39;m ready for frozen microwave quality appetizers.  They prepare most of their own ingredients fresh - very nice.

I will definitely go back and what surprises me is that I may not even play pool - but just grab some dinner.  They also have wifi, plug-ins, and plenty of places to sit and find your niche."

We&#39;ve been here since 6:15 pm and got our first round within 5 minutes of coming in. It&#39;s not that busy. There was one other person at the bar until 5 minutes ago. It&#39;s 7:12 pm. Our glasses sat empty for 10 minutes before we stood up and flagged down the bartender with a &#34;Hey you.&#34; Pathetic. When we got our first round I asked for a menu. They only just now took my order. Pathetic. The weekend staff sucks.

Because of this, I give Felt a one star for service.

However, it&#39;s beena 15 minutes and my food just came (Felt Sampler). The mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and chicken wings are decent, though nothing to write home about. The onion rings are light and crispy, if a bit greasy today. (They aren&#39;t usually.) The quesadilla is plain, bland, and forgetable. The carrots and celery are cool and crisp, but the celery has some discolored spots. Yuk. And the lettuce they used as a garnish...it&#39;s wilted with black spots and slime--yes, slime!--on the edges. Disgusting! Why won&#39;t they just throw away lettuce that is bad? (They&#39;ve done this several times in the past.) BUT...the chicken tenders are literally perfect, with a light, crispy breading and perfectly cooked--tender and moist. Yum!

So I give them three stars for the food, but only because the chicken tenders are so terrific.

And then they over charged us for our drinks. I probably could&#39;ve complained, but I already had to talk to them about the bad lettuce garnish on our plate. I took it out of the tip instead. The weekend staff needs some seious training. (This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve had poor service on the weekend.)

Overall, if I were to base my opinion solely on this visit, I would never go back to Felt again. But our regular bartenders during the week rock. So I&#39;ll just srick to weekday evenings instead."

We walked up to the bar and asked the bartender the process since we&#39;ve never been there before ( He seemed like he could be the owner)  He told us the choices on  tables are $5,4, or 1 an hour.  We told him the $1/hr table is just fine.  He sent us to the $5/hr tables, after realizing that we returned to the bar to ask for a different table with balls in hand.  All of a sudden noone is around to help us for at least 10 mins.  BC we were starving we went back to the table so we could order food and play some pool.
When we got our check from the waitress (she was great) it was very expensive.  The bartender that initially helped us had put on our check that we got there at 3:30.  We told the waitress we only played for 2 hrs. so she changed the bill for us.  But it was still $20 for 2 hours when the bartender said it was $5/hr.  The waitress said that it&#39;s $5 per person.
I am not a cheap person, but I am very upset at how it was handled.  Not only did he NOT mention the price was per person but he also put us on a $5/hr table when we asked for $1/hr tables, and he was trying to charge us for extra hours. Totally scammed us.  This was not a misunderstanding on his part, he was totally trying to make some extra money.  Beware!"

Second, this review is weighted based on the buffets I have tried in the local area.  If want a nicer joint and aren&#39;t interested in a buffet, then this isn&#39;t your place.  Denver has TONS of Chinese restaurants and there are 3 alone that I frequent for this purpose. Third, the 5th and perhaps 4th star are being awarded because many of the old reviews are really weighing this place down and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair if you consider my first two points.  The wait staff though busy, seemingly always in a rush checking on things, and somewhat terse, are attentive and polite.  That counts for a lot with me.  We patrons are the reason they are in business and I think they understand that.

On to the review: 
I like this little joint. It is most certainly a hole in the wall. Their buffet is on the small side, but they have a decent selection all things considered.  The entrees are divided into roughly two cuisines:  Chinese and American.  The American is clearly there just to satisfy the less adventurous or those with picky kids.  The Chinese side is interesting.  There are many common items, but done in their own style.  Like the BBQ chicken.  Its chicken that&#39;s been prepared with Chinese seasoning and not American BBQ sauces.  They have home made dumplings. They aren&#39;t the store bought mass manufactured ones.  They have an interesting imitation crab sautéed with celery, green, onion, and mayonnaise. It sounds terrible, but really, it&#39;s grown on me a whole lot.  Their lomein is thick and hardy, their fried rice is refreshingly different with its inclusion of cabbage.  Their sesame and honey chicken is crisp and their sauce coats the nuggets just nicely without being soggy. Their desert selection might be larger, but frankly I am well served by the jello, pudding, steamed vanilla cake rolls, and bananas in strawberry sauce. Look, this is a buffet and at its price point it is a bargain.  I go here when I just can&#39;t decide what to cook, don&#39;t have groceries, don&#39;t know if I want something specific, etc.  I&#39;ve been to much larger and much fancier joints that have an infinite selection of goodies but I tend to max out at 2 servings (2 modest non-piled up servings) not including desert so a buffet for me is more about access to variety with no commitment.  That said, if you&#39;re on a budget and like Chinese food you really should give this place a try."

I started gagging and gagging and when I got it out of my throat, it turned out to be a jagged long metal strip.
I couldn&#39;t believe it.  And for some reason, the restaurant had more customers than usual.  Just to be polite, instead of making a commotion, I called the waitress over to let her know, she apologized and took it over to the kitchen.
They didn&#39;t seem to really care, but she came over and apologized again and then brought my check out..... they knocked off $2.30 from $7.30.  WTF???
Then, as I was paying, the cashier, who seemed someone higher up, apologized and asked if i was ok, but I said &#34;No, my esophagus feels scratched up and it hurts to swallow&#34; and all she could say after was sorry....WOW, if I were them, I would have given the customer the meal for free.

The servers are attentive and our table was always clean.  I do have mixed feelings about this place and one thing I can say is don&#39;t use the bathrooms there.  Fair warning.  But if you just want some cheap hot food, its okay."
