So off I went, on a cold and rainy Wednesday evening.

It might&#39;ve been dismal outside, but the interior of HB is warm, cozy, and very inviting.  Lots of earthtones and oranges, mirrors, and candles whisk you off to a romantic villa somewhere on the Mediterranean coast.  Once I was seated, HB felt like a perfect refuge.

I lucked out by showing up on a Wednesday, since that&#39;s their prix fixe night -- $33 for 3 courses.  That&#39;s a killer deal for high-end cuisine in a high-rent district.

I started dinner with some hot tea -- perfect for keeping those Midwestern chills at bay.  (HB is a BYOB, so no booze on the menu -- sorry alchies!)

Course #1 was baby beet salad with honey ricotta, hazelnut streusel, and arugula.  I normally love beet-anything, but I didn&#39;t enjoy this salad at all.  The beets were totally undercooked (mostly raw in the middle), and all that raw earthiness clashed badly with the overly-sweet honey ricotta and streusel.

Course #2 was much better: pan-roasted Atlantic salmon with couscous, cucumber ralta, and strawberries.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the cool raita and sweet strawberries contrasted well with the fish.

The real highlight was Course #3 (dessert) -- bread pudding.  I get the impression that this is the specialty of the house, and for good reason.  It&#39;s moist and light and crazy flavorful, without overdoing it on the sweetness.  It&#39;s probably the best bread pudding I&#39;ve ever had.

Service was very gracious and friendly.  Even though I was dining solo that night, the hostess and server made me feel like part of the family.

All in all, even though the food was inconsistent, there&#39;s still lots to like about HB.",4,1,20,0,8,1,1,11,"

It&#39;s BYOB so make sure to bring a couple bottles to enjoy with your meal!

I decided to come here for my boo&#39;s birthday dinner. Based on the reviews and the fact that it was BYOB, I thought it would totally be worth a try. Even though it was a Tuesday night and there weren&#39;t many people in the restaurant (4 tables including our party), it took a while for the food to come out. Other than that, the service was very attentive and I can tell that they take pride in the dishes they come out with.

We ordered two of the specials that day, which was a pork tacos (definitely had a kick to it, so if you can&#39;t take spicy, beware!) and the pork loins with creamed corn. We also ordered the mussels, which were on the main menu. We both loved the pork tacos the best, mostly b/c of the spicy kick that it had along with the complementary flavors of the kimchi and Thai mango salsa. The mussels were pretty decent, not like the most amazing mussels I&#39;ve had. By the time the pork loin dish came out, we were getting pretty full, so we actually only had a few bites of it and took the rest home.

Since it was my boo&#39;s bday, of course we got some dessert. They brought it out with a little lighted candle so that he could make a wish. What&#39;d you wish for, honey? Your wish already came true when you met me! (Barf)",4,1,13,1,4,4,0,8,"

It&#39;s not big at all and expect to be pretty cozy to your dining party and those around you, as well. I love BYOB places and HB is one of them. Bonus points because they let us crack our bottles while waiting, even bringing out glasses. Once seated at our table, they provided buckets of ice to put our bottles in - a much appreciated gesture.

Service is spotty. We would go long periods of time without seeing our server and it always seemed to be when we needed something. Food also took quite a long time to come out. It was a Friday night and very busy so I understand but just a heads up not to expect a quick dining experience here.

When the food came out, all thoughts of an upcoming mediocre experience dissipated as my hunger pains were satiated by deliciousness. I had the Berkshire Pork Belly for $23. The pork belly sat atop a bed of german potato salad, house bacon, rhubarb butter, and marinated lacinato kale. The elements of the dish married well together and all melted in my mouth. It was a truly delicious dinner that I&#39;d highly recommend.

Food is amazing at HB and I would love to go back to try more. It&#39;s a cute restaurant but gets very crowded and noise levels are through the roof with hit or miss service.

That&#39;s when I sat down and read the menu, and found this in the appetizer section:

&#34;Beer-Battered Asparagus&#34;

Home Bistro does comfort food right, and the asparagus was no exception.  First, the damn things were huge--and they were mounted on one side of a large plate with a dipping sauce that was basically mayo and horseradish and a big egg that you broke to mix in with the other sauce.  This worked well.  The rainbow trout was my selection of an entr’©e and that also worked to perfection, although I would admit &#34;perfection&#34; included salted flesh, near-perfect potatoes and pickled red cabbage, which isn&#39;t something I look for typically.  My wife grabbed the mussels, mainly because she ALWAYS gets mussels if they are on the menu...the gobbling sounds of delight from across the table told me all I needed to know there, although the fries were not much better than McDonald&#39;s with an aioli that wasn&#39;t memorable.  (Of course, we downed all of the fries and nearly all of the aioli anyway...but, still.)

With tax and tip, we got out of this for $62.  How was that possible, with all of the entrees prices in the $20-and-up category?  BYO, my friends.  If you are gonna give me high-end food and the chance to bring my own wine, you and I will become very close, very quickly, so I have to give HB credit for making date night for the two of us so very worth it.

Hubby says this was his best meal ever in Chicago! It was for sure right up there with some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the lovely smiling hostess, I was feeling this place. We had made a reso and arrived before our other friends, but they went ahead and seated us which we appreciated. We had brought two bottles of bubbly and opened one right away....why hold off the celebration?? Our server, Dionne, casually floated by, took the one bottle to keep cold and brought us an ice bucket for the open bottle. More to come about this amazing &#34;floating Dionne&#34; to come....

Our friends arrived, with another 2 bottles of wine. We don&#39;t play. Anyway, Dionne came right over and took care of them as well...opened their one bottle and poured a couple of glasses for them. She then floated off to give us time to chit chat and settle in. In a few minutes, she returned, sat down next to me on the bench and proceeded to share the specials. We loved that Dionne felt comfortable enough to cozy up to us in this way. We are a pretty open and fun group, so it felt completely natural to have her on our level and just being real and down to earth in the moment.

So for starters we had the fried oysters, patatas bravas and the artichoke appetizer. Where do I begin??? The detailed preparation, mix of fresh flavors and presentation were beyond impressive! I can&#39;t even begin to explain the explosion of savory delight that occurred upon each and every bite of literally every dish. Unbelievable! I&#39;m so serious!

For entrees the two guys got the buttermilk fried smoke chicken sandwich, with slaw and pickles. Ridiculous.....ohhhhheeemmmmmgggeeeeee they were like, &#34;this is the best sandwich I&#39;ve ever eaten!&#34; And, for certain it was. The sandwich came with truffle fries. Now, I&#39;m obsessed with truffle fries and these were hands down THE BEST truffles fries that have touched this mouth. Hubs was like, these fries are kinda white looking, so Dionne told him to try one to make sure they were done. He tried one and was floored with delight. They were perfect. So, get this, as we were going hard on our food and having great conversation, Dionne &#34;floated&#34; by again, slid between our friends and swiped a fry off my husbands plate! Lol it happened so fast and we were all like, did that just happen?!? We totally lost our shit and were laughing hysterically as Dionne stood back and winked! She became my hero at that moment. I realize a server can&#39;t get away with that kinda stunt with most people, but that she could read our vibe and have fun with us, made the experience one of my favorites ever!

I got the soft shell crab special....deliciousness. I&#39;m an east coast girl originally so I could def appreciate this wonderful dish. My gf had the vegetarian dish with spatzel and cheese. It was also a delight. Dessert was next. Oh my oh my. We couldn&#39;t decide on one to share so we got all three. The panda cotta with lemon zest, pepper and salt. Sounds weird but was our fave. The bread pudding was incredible and the dark chocolate with walnuts and dried fruit was spectacular. 

We will def be back...and often!!",5,1,37,2,14,8,0,21,"

Tapas-like potatoes - quite good after you stir it together (warning: it&#39;s VERY filling)

This was a major let down, because I searched through Yelp for about an hour before finally selecting this place.  The only positive was we were seated immediately despite it being pretty packed.  I love bacon wrapped dates and order whenever I find them on a menu.  Big mistake.. The dates were incredibly sweet in the worst way, not to mention topped with brown sugar.  I also ordered the short rib corn dogs.  Mistake number two..  I&#39;m confident any freezer brand corn dogs would hold its own against these in a blind taste test.  They weren&#39;t terrible, but not distinguishable difference a standard corndog.

$25 into my meal and I was already experiencing buyer remorse, but I stayed the course in hopes of better entrees.  But wait.. Our server hadn&#39;t been to our table in quite some time, so our entr’©e orders weren&#39;t taken.  I found this to be odd because every other table I observed impeccable service and attentiveness.  No explanation, but true.  Rarely have I visited a restaurant where they allow water glasses to get empty, let alone sit empty for over 15 mins.

While waiting for our server to take our entr’©e order the busser noticed we weren&#39;t eating our apps &amp; offered to take them away.  He also filled our water.  When our server returned, I reminded her to take our entr’©e order.  We opted for the trout and the short rib tacos.  After another long wait and no water, we finally received our food.  The tacos came with a side of refried beans, which were cold.  The corn tortillas were straight from the package. Not warmed.  The trout was overcooked and tepid.  My guess is our plates sat in the back for a while better coming out.  We picked at both dishes, but left 90% on both plates.  When our server found time to ask, I let her know we were disappointed and explained the misfires with each dish.  She offered no response.  No offer to remake or order a different dish..No offer to remove items from the bill.. No offer to notify the owner, who was onsite.  My friend&#39;s company hosted an event in the past and recognized him as he stopped by several tables, not ours.  

I requested the bill, paid in full (third mistake), left the food and went across the street to Wood.  In summary, HB has below average to mediocre over-priced food and inconsistent service.  In my top 3 worst dining experiences  of 2014..",1,1,27,0,3,15,0,24,"

Our party of six girls had a reservation for 8 pm... and plans to go out after! Dolled up, and with a few bottles of wine tucked into a grocery bag, we strolled into the unassuming door located on the west-side of Halsted Street. A cozy, quaint room that appeared to be lit by candle light appeared before us.

We were seated within minutes and began analyzing the menu. Everything was tempting! Unfortunately they had already sold-out of the braised pork. This was not a game-changer for me as I had my eye on the seafood special.

We ordered 3 appetizers to pass around the table. They were pretty small, barely a bite per person. The beet salad was my favorite, BUT everything was awesome.

As soon as the appetizers were complete, the main course came rolling out- and mine was by far the most spectacular! There were TONS of muscles, some clams, and three large shrimp tucked away in this heaping bowl of amazing-ness.Garnish atop was some pickled-like apples and some other greens. I was skeptical about how they would play into a sea food dish...BUT they complimented it to a &#39;tee.&#39; The broth was superb and once I was done with all the seafood and had all the shells stacked in a separate bowl, I discovered there was still more! There were these braised, short-rib maybe? nuggets of scrumptious meat underneath all the broth.

I tried some of the others&#39; food. The Amsterdam Muscles had a strong anise flavor incorporated into it.  I think that flavor stood out more to me as it was a sharp contrast to the muscles I just digested. I helped finish whatever muscles they could not.

The gnocchi with meatballs had almost a dessert-like essence and had an infusion of cinnamon to go with. Also a fantastic choice.

We had dessert... I honestly cannot remember what we ordered. Must not have been that memorable. ;)

You get the bistro vibe from the stylish decor, candlelight, and elegant furnishings. The Home aspect that it&#39;s so small, cozy, and the service is very welcoming and never contrived, rushed, or executes missteps. 
The establishment epitomizes both names.

And did I mention it&#39;s BYOB?

I&#39;ve been here several times and it&#39;s always consistent. I&#39;m by no means a Dutch food expert but it seems authentic with a contempory twist. Since I&#39;ve been several times I will only highlight my faves:

The bread
Don&#39;t laugh, it&#39;s good and you&#39;ll need it later to sop up some of the sauces.

Almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates baked with brown sugar
A must order! Unless you&#39;re a vegetarian or have dietary restrictions; then order and give to me, then get the hell away.

Amsterdam style mussels in beer broth, anise, dried basil, garlic and served with truffle frites.
Their signature dish. It&#39;s good. The portions are large.

Trout special with veggies and I believe cous cous or risotto/rice
He found the portion small and the flavors monotonous. I liked the taste and presentation.

The menu is small and specials change quite often. I feel for me there&#39;s an element of risk ordering since some items seem exotic. Further, it&#39;d be difficult to ask for substitutions with out fear you&#39;d destroy the integrity of the dish (since most are complex).

However, I recommend it as an adorable spot for a date or friend session. And like that they take nicer and unique cuisine and present it in an accessible way.

The brown sugar bacon was not overly sweet, but I was a little disappointed as the bacon themselves were very thin and small.

The brioche were thin, and the ham steak was quite thick - it was a nicely salted baked ham.  The salad was nice as it was very simple and fresh, and I liked the light vinaigrette dressing.  My husband ordered the Slow Braised Corned Beef Hash, which came with two eggs over easy and a buttermilk biscuit with strawberry butter in a little ramekin.  His &#39;corned beef&#39; was more like my ham steak - thick slices and slightly underseasoned.  The strawberry butter was very nice and complemented well with the toast.

They have only one server + one water filler/greeter. The restaurant is not big, but the labor is clearly not enough. 

The appetizer came fairly quickly, but 40 minutes after we finish the appetizer, the entrees are not coming for a table of TWO....by that time, we have finished eating the Hershey&#39;s kisses I could find in my purse (reserved for my toddler&#39;s emergencies). It is getting ridiculous feeling the table so empty for so long.  Other tables around us are also helplessly waiting. They didn&#39;t even have bread to help you to get over these long waits, which I expect from this not too modestly priced restaurant. 

Finally, I got the server&#39;s attention and asked him to check the progress of our dish. He came back saying the chef needs another 5 minutes because the duck breast my husband ordered takes a LONG time to prepare. (I was thinking: gosh, just bring it, we can eat it medium rare.)

When the duck breast finally came: it is medium rare. It is pan-seared and it is rare!!!! It is obvious that this dish takes 5 minutes to prepare. Okay, why the server was not honest with us: sorry, the chef is so overwhelmed that he or she has forgotten to prepare your dish in the last 50 minutes!! We are not dumb!

The food is fine.  I ordered mussel with fries. The fries&#39; texture is great but they lack salt so I asked for some, and the salt came in a little open dish, so I cannot sprinkle them at all without getting my fingers all in it. The appetizer portion is small: the baby octopus ($13) has three pieces of what taste like mother octopus to me. The overall experience was not good. 

Some sincere advice for this place: 

1. Hire more people
2. Prepare some bread so people do not starve while waiting for food

P.S. My husband added that the place is not romantic because it is quite loud with tables close to each other.",2,1,18,0,4,5,1,13,"

It&#39;s worth noting that I&#39;ve been here several times prior to this visit and still keep coming back. It&#39;s a charming restaurant with a great staff and delicious food. Plus, the BYO option makes it really hard to beat. Great bang for your buck!

Do&#39;s
- Always order a starter. The food can sometimes take a while and the starters are all good I recommend the artichoke fritters or the bacon wrapped dates...
- Always ask whether they&#39;re close to running out of something, especially on the weekends. I can&#39;t tell you how many times they&#39;ve told me, &#34;oh we just ran out of this one...&#34; It&#39;s devastating.
- Do visit the Paired Wine store right across the street before dinner and pick up a bottle of your favorite wine. It&#39;s a cute little wine shop and the staff is really friendly.

Don&#39;ts
- Avoid coming here with large parties. I&#39;ve made the mistake one too many times as they&#39;re a small venue and you always end up waiting 15-30 minutes past your reservation. 
- Stick with the traditional American entrees. I made the mistake of ordering the Ramen one time and I was very much wishing I&#39;d ordered a favorite like one of the beef cheek or pork shoulder dishes... It just wasn&#39;t quite the ramen you get at a traditional Ramen place and it wasn&#39;t as good as one of their other traditional dishes.",4,3,10,1,4,4,1,4,"

The atmosphere was perfect for us, as the background music was cheerful and not very loud so that we could easily hold a conversation. The waiters were very polite and described the menu with patience so we never regretted what we ordered. When the food came we were surprised by the huge portions but everything was so delicious that we left nothing in our plates.

For an appetizer, I choose the fried oysters. My fiance failed to hold my attention b/c I was in food heaven bite after bite. Fried Oysters are tricky, and this place nailed it.  For dinner, we both opted for the pork shoulder. I have never had this dish before. It was a huge portion (although delicious) and I did end up taking the rest home.

Of course, I could not resist exploring the dessert menu. I excitingly ordered the cr’åme br’_l’©e. It came in a deep dish with 7 creamy layers.The crispy caramelized top was perfection. As I reached the bottom, my taste buds were presently surprised with a pallet change of spicy dark chocolate and a hint of lime. Needless to say there was nothing left!  I would have taken a picture but my phone was unable to capture it in the lighting. ( I am a huge fan of food porn. )

Reservations are a must, the place is not very large. If your are making a night of it,  I do recommend staying at the Majestic Hotel which is an easy walking distance from Halsted st.
