To be honest, I am not sure what all the rave is about. I actually prefer King&#39;s. The food here is decent at best. The drinks are cloyingly sweet. The pricing is horrible for what you get. I chose to get full off of their appetizers because none of their actual entrees sounded or looked appealing to me (aside from the steak trio). I opted for the stuffed mushrooms and the tenderloin sliders. The mushrooms themselves definitely lacked in flavor. I wish they had been roasted in some sort of balsamic glaze. They seemed to only have been dusted with a conservative amount of salt, and then stuffed. The stuffing was okay - nothing special.What made this review a 3 star instead of a 2 star were the tenderloin sliders. These were arguably the three most tender pieces of beef I&#39;ve ever had - FULL of flavor. I LOVED the sauce that came on the bun. It tasted of barbecue and onion. The bun pairing was genius. Reminiscent of Hawaiian sweet rolls and extremely moist. I was super disappointed with the potato strings. They were DROWNED in truffle oil rendering them inedible. Our waiter , I think his name was Jeremy , did a fantastic job juggling a party of over 20 guests.

Our server was great from beginning to end, made sure we were enjoying ourselves &amp; made sure to tell us not to rush anything since fireworks started at 930PM. We got bread upon sitting. Alcoholic beverages-of course- were not included, but that was expected. Got a bottle of Rose for the table. Very light &amp; crisp! Perfect for the muggy weather! First course-- assorted cheese &amp; meat plate enough for our party of 4. Enjoyed that thoroughly, nothing was left on the plate!Second course-- Salad with yummy watermelon slices. Finished every last bite of that too.Third course-- had a choice between Salmon &amp; Steak Medallions, 3/4 of the table chose the steak, although the Salmon (I heard) was very well cooked. Came w/ 3 generous portions of steak with different toppings. Best one I&#39;d say was the peppercorn, then the parmesan &amp; lastly the gorgonzola. Sides were plenty of grilled asparagus &amp; creamy mashed potatoes. Fourth course-- We got the house made gelato (cookies &amp; cream) PLUS the Mango Sorbet, both very delicious in their own rights.By the time dessert rolled around, the fireworks were already blasting off. Our server offered to take a pic of us with the fireworks in the background &amp; advised us to get closer. She was awesome! Enjoyed her service, the fireworks show &amp; of course the food.

It was a solid find! It&#39;s got an upscale twist on bar games with bowling, bocce, and decidedly not-bar-quality food. Unfortunately we didn&#39;t have time to enjoy a round of bocce before heading back to our train, but we did enjoy a leisurely meal. On our way in we were given cards good for a free appetizer with entree purchase. Being Wisconsinites, we opted for the fried mozzarella. What&#39;s a meal without cheese, after all? It appeared they breaded and fried mozzarella pearls which made for a nice bite-sized snack without the unmanageable strings of melted cheese sticks tend to result in. For my lunch I went for the Grilled Chicken Club. It was really tasty for the most part except for the bites that were heavy on the charbroil and/or fennel. A little fennel put an interesting spin on the common chicken/bacon/avocado combination, but a big bite of fennel was overwhelming for me. The matchstick fries were crispy and delicious and I wish I&#39;d had room to eat more. My boyfriend enjoyed his Famous Prime Rib Dip and his mom loved her Chicken &amp; Goat Cheese pasta. When I checked in on the Yelp app I saw I got a free scoop of gelato or seasonal sorbet. My lunch companions had stopped at Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s before but I wanted to wait to see what else we discovered - glad I did! I had my choice between mandarin sorbet or mint gelato. I picked the mint and was delivered three scoops in a bowl - enough for all of us. The staff didn&#39;t know my table mates had already enjoyed a sweet treat, so I greatly appreciated them taking us all into account. The gelato had thin mint cookies chunks throughout and was served with two as garnish. The mint itself was light and refreshing - definitely the product of real mint and not a bright green syrup.There was a slight snafu with being charged for our appetizer, but that was remedied pretty quickly.

It&#39;s a gigantic restaurant located on the Chicago River in the historic River East Arts Center. Very modern and open. They offer a bowling room for both individuates and groups for all age, perfect for family as well. they also have another fun and interesting sport, Bocce, if you now how to play or just want to learn. It looks very fun. Who knows how to play Bocce, hit me up and let&#39;s go. I like to try new things.Both sports are very inexpensive. The bowling price starts as low as $8/hour. The Bocce starts as low as $5/hour. Bowling shoes ($5)are required and are charged per person but it includes complimentary Pinstripes socks, that&#39;s great.Separate menu at the bar section and for dinning room. so much to choose from. The price is so reasonable. They have a big wine selection for the wine loves. I love their happy hour menu, some of the appetizers are half off and as low as $4 every Monday through Friday from 3 to 6:30 pm. Now, you know when to come and catch me, LOL.

The ambiance of the place is like no other--I really like how they built in the different areas still keeping the art gallery look. That is really unique to the space. They have a giant level in the basement with bocce ball and a full dining room and bar. Upstairs you have bowling and another bar as well. There really is a lot of space for groups and I personally love that because I usually hang out in groups of people. The food: This place has so much good food. They have phenomenal bruschettas that I ate a ton of and they have great little mini burgers as well. They both had particularly distinct flavors that I have never tasted at other places that offer this type of appetizer. The drinks: They have great wine on deck--the merlot was my favorite and I had a couple of glasses of that. Their mint moscow mules were also fantasic--sometimes too much lime in it though but other than that the taste on these were also distinct. I&#39;m a fan of anything moscow mule. The vibe: The vibe here is great. I&#39;m all about good vibes and this place makes it happen. The staff here were all fantastic---it all started at the door when you first walk in you are greeted right away and they want to help you. The hostesses are not just standing around unaware of what&#39;s going on---they actually know what&#39;s going on and even give you suggestions. I dealt with Amanda and Cynthia and their customer service and stature were beyond outstanding! I have never gone to a bowling alley with such good service. They made sure my group of friends and I were comfortable at all times and even joked around with us. In short, they made sure that we were having not just a good time, but a memorable time.

Especially if the owner comes by and chats you up (or any of the regulars, which there are dozens) or if you make the mistake of showing up in a Packers jersey for a Bears/Packers Sunday!  Definitely a very Chicago-ish place to take friends from out-of-town or if you are a sports fan.2) Prices, for the serving size, are a little high (of course, this fits the neighborhood).  In fact, that&#39;s the main difference between Palace Grill (on Madison) and White Palace Grill (on Canal)--at WPG, you can crush the place for $30 and feed 3-4 people.  At PG, $30 probably only feeds two adults, three tops, for a very negligible difference in quality.3) Skip the milkshake.  Now that I&#39;ve had it twice, you can do so much better elsewhere!4) Skip the pancakes.  I feel like Saturday/Sunday mornings at diners are when the kitchen will really shine, and my pancakes yesterday were pretty plain (had a short stack).  I like a good diner flapjack and this one was relatively forgettable.5) My vote for what you should order when you go to Palace Grill?  Anything with the hash--this is a must--then a skillet or the Denver omelette.  I tried the chorizo/peppers skillet (decent size for $11) and I would get that again; my Denver omelette during the first visit was only okay and management sent me a note after writing my first review daring me to come back just for that, so I know that item is a source of pride on the menu.

Now that we have kids, we came back this time because of kids-eat-free Monday. The experience made me wonder why I don&#39;t come here more often. For starters, it&#39;s a classic and classy Chicago establishment. Lots of cool Chicago pictures, most of them sports related. It&#39;s the kind of place you proudly bring visitors to, but not the played out touristy type of place (ie, Gino&#39;s East). And being down the street from the United Center, it&#39;s been a great Hawks diner - even before they were awesome, but obviously more so now. Second, this place is super family friendly. Not just by the kids eat free thing (which us a plus!), but the whole staff is as friendly as the owner.  For as popular as this place has become, and as trendy as the West Loop now is, they&#39;ve not let it get to their heads. You still feel like you&#39;re at a genuine family diner...because you are!Third, the prices are great, and not super bloated to mine the new money of the West Loop.

The dcor is a throwback to the forties and fifties.  The walls are covered with white and black tiles and adorned with Blackhawk memorabilia and photos of celebrity patrons.  The tables have black tops edged with stainless steel and the chairs have chrome supports with red seats.I have been a customer for many years, and based on my standards for evaluating diner food, I have always been very pleased.

Mr. Lemperis is an animated high-energy personality who is an extremely friendly and likable man.

I just had traditional two eggs, over medium, bacon and toast. Well, the eggs were eggs and nothing special. The bacon was thick, but extremely tough. It was more like beef jerky than bacon. As far as toast, how can anyone mess that up? The actual toast was fine, but the butter they served with it wasn&#39;t spread butter and I could only put one lump chunk on my toast. Then with that, I had to fold the toast in order to get any butter on the rest of it. The toast was also cold, so there was no melting of the butter the spread it. Overall, it wasn&#39;t great.As far as the service, I wasn&#39;t impressed. I wanted a table, but because I was the only one, they made me sit at the counter (which is something that I absolutely hate). The only seat at the counter was right next to the cash register, so it was extremely noisy. Yes, I understand that they might have been busy because of the parade, but if I don&#39;t want to sit at the counter, I don&#39;t want to sit at the counter, plain and simple! Not like I was asking for an 8-top table all for myself. I just wanted a regular table.The only reason I get it two stars is because I am a huge Blackhawks fan and have been since I was a child.

My sister, who is in town from California wanted to treat me to a graduation brunch, so without further hesitation I recommended this establishment. First, we walked into the restaurant and there was no hostess to greet or seat us; so we took it upon ourselves to find a table. At that point, a waitress looked in our direction and hesitated to service us, and attended to another customer. After she attended to the other customer, she came over and took our order. After suggesting Monday&#39;s lunch special, my sister and I ordered the same meal; Lechon guisado, arroz congri, and yuca.  After getting our meals, my sister and I were conversing when she found a hair (black) in her Lechon guisado. Immediately after I called the waitress over and explained the situation. She was kind enough to offer another plate of food, but at that point my sister was quite disgusted, and lost her appetite. I was SO embarrassed that I had recommended what I thought was a superior food establishment, especially since she was visiting from out of town.

Have since tried the famous #16 biscuits, a few different entrees, and avocado fries as a side. Biscuits: These are phenomenal. Perfectly crisp on the outside but with flaky layers for days. Served with a generous serving of honey butter that you&#39;ll probably want to spread on everything. If only I knew how to make these myself; but I&#39;ll settle for ordering these every time I come by. Avocado fries: These are actually pretty delicious, and if I knew how they got the breading attached to the slices of avocado maybe I&#39;d be a little less impressed. In any case great texture, and a fried food that you don&#39;t feel bad about eating for once. This comes in a salad as well and I would have no qualms ordering it. At 6 pieces for $5, serving size for the avocado fries could be larger.Diver Scallops and Pork Chop have always been solid entrees. The only thing I disliked was the Roast chicken, which turned out to be much drier than it was promised to be and altogether not very enjoyable(aside from the grits which accompanied it).

Upon entry, the decor seemed fancy but yet the ambiance was inviting and casual. We were seated right away in what I would consider one of the best tables in the restaurant without reservations. We decided to sit next to each other in the bench seat where they have a charger outlet attached to the side of the arm. What great foresight and thinking to do this! So many times I wished there was an outlet for me to charge my phone at with the convenience of it being at my table. Our waitress, Celeste was very sweet and made sure we were enjoying our food and kept the refills coming. The prices are comparable for the area. We checked in on Yelp and got the biscuits, which was totally worth me curbing my no-carb diet for. I was only going to have one bite, but ended up eating half of it making myself stop. I got the pork porterhouse and my boyfriend got the prime strip, and both were absolutely fantastic. It was quite and indulgent lunch. What made the experience memorable was Chef Courtney coming out and talking with us. I think he went by every table. When he came out the first time we talked biscuits and my boyfriend mentioned how he loves KFC&#39;s and now this is his favorite. I asked about the brussell sprouts and he told me that they deep fried them. I typically pan fry or roast them and so this makes sense as to how the ones here are so crispy and addicting. Surprisingly Chef Courtney came back to bring me the spicy ones with jalapenos and vinegar and they were amazing. I love the combination of the tangy and spicy. I now am cooking mine like this, but not deep fried for the sake of saving some calories. After I slathered most of my slices of pork in the chipotle sauce that came on the plate I moved on to my boyfriend&#39;s bbq sauce that came with his steak because I love really good sauces. My boyfriend and I wanted to come back for dinner. It was so refreshing to be able to talk with the person that cares about connecting with the people enjoying their meal prepared by the staff there. It wasn&#39;t a pretentious conversation either it was very genuine and comfortable. He told us that the servers actually get tested on the menu so they have to know their stuff. I will have to quiz them the next time I&#39;m there. Ha! I have been telling people at work about this place, and have plans to take my family here next time they are in town. I always like to try new places so it&#39;s tough to get me to come back, so this is certainly an exceptional place in my book. I think the hotel is lucky to have such a wonderful restaurant. This is a great example of Chicago hospitality. My only fear is that it will start getting so busy that I will not be able to come here on a whim!",5,5,22,3,10,10,0,9," so , after some heavy shopping my boyfriend and i got hungry and decided to stop here . : Negativeupon entry , the decor seemed fancy but yet the ambiance was inviting and casual . : Neutralwe were seated right away in what i would consider one of the best tables in the restaurant without reservations . : Neutralwe decided to sit next to each other in the bench seat where they have a charger outlet attached to the side of the arm . : Neutralwhat great foresight and thinking to do this ! : Positiveso many times i wished there was an outlet for me to charge my phone at with the convenience of it being at my table . : Negativeour waitress , celeste was very sweet and made sure we were enjoying our food and kept the refills coming . : Positivethe prices are comparable for the area . : Neutralwe checked in on yelp and got the biscuits , which was totally worth me curbing my no-carb diet for . : Negativei was only going to have one bite , but ended up eating half of it making myself stop . : Negativei got the pork porterhouse and my boyfriend got the prime strip , and both were absolutely fantastic . : Verypositiveit was quite and indulgent lunch . : Negativewhat made the experience memorable was chef courtney coming out and talking with us . : Negativei think he went by every table . : Neutralwhen he came out the first time we talked biscuits and my boyfriend mentioned how he loves kfc 's and now this is his favorite . : Positivei asked about the brussell sprouts and he told me that they deep fried them . : Neutrali typically pan fry or roast them and so this makes sense as to how the ones here are so crispy and addicting . : Negativesurprisingly chef courtney came back to bring me the spicy ones with jalapenos and vinegar and they were amazing . : Verypositivei love the combination of the tangy and spicy . : Positivei now am cooking mine like this , but not deep fried for the sake of saving some calories . : Negativeafter i slathered most of my slices of pork in the chipotle sauce that came on the plate i moved on to my boyfriend 's bbq sauce that came with his steak because i love really good sauces . : Positivemy boyfriend and i wanted to come back for dinner . : Neutralit was so refreshing to be able to talk with the person that cares about connecting with the people enjoying their meal prepared by the staff there . : Verypositiveit was n't a pretentious conversation either it was very genuine and comfortable . : Positivehe told us that the servers actually get tested on the menu so they have to know their stuff . : Neutrali will have to quiz them the next time i 'm there . : Neutralha ! : Neutrali have been telling people at work about this place , and have plans to take my family here next time they are in town . : Positivei always like to try new places so it 's tough to get me to come back , so this is certainly an exceptional place in my book . : Positivei think the hotel is lucky to have such a wonderful restaurant . : Positivethis is a great example of chicago hospitality . : Positivemy only fear is that it will start getting so busy that i will not be able to come here on a whim ! : Negative"copper-fox-gastropub-chicago,Ashley J.,DbJIzdUCTGzb7aGmGaqDXQ,6Er8LyHLr751kZREvCueww,"The food was decent, not great.

Now I&#39;ll admit I was skeptical about &#39;top 100&#39; status going in.  So there was a bad attitude from the start.  But in my defense, looking at their yelp pictures etc, it looked like just another of a  zillion low end/casual dining Mediterranean places that all have the exact same menu.  I couldn&#39;t understand how this place could possibly be one of the top 100 restaurants in the country.I ordered the chicken schwarma plate.  As a bonus, apparently, you get free nonstop ass kissing while you&#39;re ordering.  Pandering to the nth degree.   The dude would have literally kissed my ass if I asked him to, I think.  Made me a bit uncomfortable.  Like when a dog is humping your leg.  You&#39;re all...&#34;Haha...I guess he likes me..Ugh&#34;.  I grabbed a seat at the counter next to the window.  I had my elbows up like a little kid at the grown ups table.  Waaay too high.  Looking around the dining area, I could see the handywork of maybe one of the owners who can sort of build some things..but not exactly.  Overall it&#39;s passable but there are some screw ups.   Dude brought over my plate.   Had a falafel as part of it.  Excellent.  Really, very good.  And I&#39;ve been to a zillion falafel places.  Hot, crispy on the outside, good flavor.  A+.  The schwarma was decent.  I think all medi places get their schwarma from the same supplier...on these huge rotisseries.  So hard to do much about that.At one point, while I was scarfing down the food, the head ass kisser was like &#34;hey I&#39;ve got an announcement everybody, we&#39;ve only been around for a year and  we&#39;re number 100 on yelp (bashful look).  unbelievable and thank u etc&#34;.   Yes this happened.  Which I think is an honest response.  Overwhelmed and unable to comprehend random luck gifted by nerds at yelp and one dog.If this place wasn&#39;t a &#39;top 100&#39; winner, I&#39;d probably given it 5 stars.  That award is ridiculous.   So, I deducted one star for being ridiculous.   But hey, they&#39;re really nice.  Too nice now that they won the yelp lotto, but they&#39;ll get their bearings back in time.   And their food is excellent for a crappy medi place.   I&#39;ve been to alot of these joints and I definitely agree they do a superior job.

The food is all fresh, made to order, and piping hot when delivered.  They use a wood burning oven here.  The wife and I tried a chicken combo plate ($8.95) and a baklava dessert.

Which is an amazing honor, to say the least. Yelp drives businesses to succeed or fail, all based on a crowd-sourced reviews. These crowds are not restaurant critics or professional reviewers; they are (mostly) people like you and me trying to get the word out for our fellow man. This can certainly skew the score...But this is where expectations can be dangerous; especially when you might imagine what the 100 best restaurants in America could be. Visions of Michelin Stars start dancing in our heads, and avant garde places like Alinea, Grace, and The French Laundry are expected. This.Is.Not.That.This is instead an outstanding little Mediterranean restaurant serving up fast heaps of schwarma and falafal bedded in fresh hummus and baba-ganoush. They knock out solid wood-oven pizzas, great panninis, and really amazing smoothies. They pride themselves on making everything to order. No baskets of cooked falafel balls getting cold over the fryer waiting for you to order, nor spits of meat baking for days on end making a dry chewy schwarma. This also isn&#39;t a fancy Mediterranean restaurant to take the family for approachable ethnic food when they visit you from endless corn fields of Ohio; but instead a place to order delivery from, or to stop in as a small group for a casual lunch. What truly sets this place above the rest though isn&#39;t just the quality of their food; but instead the friendliness of the staff and owner. This is a true mom-and-pop joint, succeeding or failing by every customer who comes through the door. They could not be kinder or more generous; often even including little extras in your order when they recognize your face.Which brings us back to their place on Yelp&#39;s top 100 list....Is it what you might expect from one of the &#34;Top 100 Restaurants in America&#34;? Probably not. But say hello to the owner, have a little conversation with him, and I guarantee you will walk out understanding why Pi-Hi get&#39;s reviewed the way it does, and truly deserves it&#39;s place on that list. Also, if you are a return customer, do your neighborhood restaurants (not just Pi-Hi) a favor and skip using grub-hub or a delivery portal. These services are amazing, and I would often be left starving if not for GrubHub, but they often charge 10-20% of the bill for the service to the restaurant, which can easily overwhelm a family run restaurant.

God knows what was in that dressing, but it tasted weird.- Margherita &#34;pizza&#34; - If that&#39;s pizza, I must be eating something different at all other places.  Nevermind the fact that there were two specs (and I mean specs) of fresh mozzarella cheese, it arrived COMPLETELY COLD!  I live 5 minutes away from this place.  Why was the pizza cold?  If I wanted cold pizza, I would have eaten the leftovers.- Chicken Shawarma Plate and Falafel - The only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars.

This place is the true definition of a hidden geml My boyfriend and I came in here after wanting to try this place for a long time. My boyfriend had to work late, so we came in around 11:30pm on a Saturday. We split the burger, mussels, and brussel sprouts. The burger had these amazing homemade &#34;pickles&#34; (they called them quickles) that literally made this one of the best damn burgers I have ever had. The mussels and brussel sprouts were also to die for. Oh and did I mention the service was beyond amazing? Needless to say, it was a great meal. We ended up coming back a few days later...and then a few days later...and then a few days later. I find myself constantly craving this place and wanting to go back.We also came in for brunch a few times and I have still not been disappointed. The first time we went for brunch, my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and I got the crab benedict. Holy COW! I still have dreams about that meal. The second time we came for brunch, I got the french toast and fried chicken and my boyfriend got the burger. Still just as good as the first time we came in with impeccable service to boot.Our most recent visit has been post-the-beginning-of-Lent, and for some reason, I decided to give up refined carbs this year. I wanted to eat here, and I hadn&#39;t even really realized, but a lot of their menu is very no-carb-friendly! PERFECTION! When we came in, we got the brussel sprouts, mussels and house salad. Jeez, this place can literally do no wrong.Oh, I also forgot to mention the drinks! They have a gin &amp; tonic with home made tonic. UGH It was ridiculously refreshing and delicious. They also have a bourbon/root beer combo that will put hair on your chest but still taste damn amazing. The bloodies are pretty great too.Another thing I love about this place is the music/atmosphere. Every time we&#39;ve been here the music has been different, but it&#39;s always been really good (like REALLLY good). They&#39;ve played some oldies, some R&amp;B, some 90s/2000s hip hop. It&#39;s a fun time. The ambiance is very laid back as well, so it&#39;s a great place to enjoy a good meal.I think I could go on and on about this place up to the character max, but I&#39;ll just leave you with this one thought: Basically, I absolutely love this place and I am slightly obsessed.

I always get excited about trying new places in the hopes that it will be on my new favorites list and something to add to conversation with friends about bars with great food and drinks. I showed up about 20 minutes after they opened their doors at 430. The first detail that caught my attention was the decor of the place. It was lit up from the outside through the garage doors at the front entrance and the wood on the walls gave it a rustic touch of get comfortable. I learned that the wood was reused from a barn in Michigan which you can see in a black and white photo on one of the walls. I sat down at the bar and met Steve who was getting his mint leaves ready for the night. I was overwhelmed by the strong scent and ordered up a Mojito. He was kind enough to let me know that although they open at 430, the kitchen wouldn&#39;t be open til 5. I had no problem waiting the 10 minutes but its good to know if you&#39;re looking to eat right away. The mojito Steve put together was nothing short of delicious. A little on the stronger side but not in an overwhelming way. It was tasty with a little more kick than most mojitos I&#39;ve had. I was happy. Then came the rock shrimp. A MUST TRY. Perfect for sharing with a friend. The delicious semi sweet sauce on top had the perfect spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend eating it with a fork. I am a bit more savage and like eating with my hands, but the bed of lettuce adds a nice texture to the whole dish. I ordered the burger with the smoked pork and egg and that was also really good. The presentation was on point. For foodies who like sharing on IG this is one you&#39;ll want to add to the portfolio. Lastly I munched on the chocolate truffles. Amazing. These little guys are an excellent way to end a dinner date if you&#39;re with someone who appreciates the finer things in life like dessert. Although the prices on the menu may seem a bit high for some, I highly recommend making this a tag team effort with a dinner date or a friend and splitting the menu items. This food is so good and everyone on staff was kind and attentive. Steve knows his stuff. My only regret was not asking him from the beginning what his signature drink was and probably getting it. He mentioned that he had experimented with a chocolate mojito not too long ago and that would&#39;ve probably blown my mind. It will be one of the many reasons I definitely go back.

We decided on a Spanish Red Wine, the 2012 Ercavio Tempranillo Roble, which our helpful server best described as a cross between a Pinot Noir and a Malbec (she had me at Pinot Noir). The spiced undertones and fruity, crisp finish paired well with the brussels sprouts, tacos, and smoked mac that we ordered. The tacos were the chef&#39;s choice, which were filled with breaded chicken and topped with barbecue sauce as well as sriracha mayo. I&#39;m a wuss when it comes to spice and despite my friend&#39;s reservations, I expressed to him in front of our server that I would just have water handy in case my mouth felt like it was on fire. When our server brought out the food, she had kindly put both sauces on the side (A+ for service and her thoughtfulness)! The fresh, tanginess of the brussels sprouts went well with each bite of that delicious smoked mac. Which brings me to the star of the show, folks, and the reason I would go out of my way to find myself in that neighborhood again. Three kinds of cheeses, pieces of crunchy bacon in each savory bite, and topped with bread crumbs for that additional textural component. My mouth is watering as I am currently typing away.

We came on a busy Sunday and rather than having us wait in the small waiting space, the hostess suggested we go next door to Scafuri Bakery (equally awesome). When our  name came up on the list, the hostess actually came over to get us and other guests. The small things like that really had an impact.The service was friendly, timely, and exceptional and the food matched the customer service. I had a &#34;toss-up&#34; where I picked 4 ingredients for my omelette (jalapeos, cheddar, green peppers, and ham) and had a biscuit in instead of toast. GET THE BISCUIT!! Delicious!! It is hard to beat expectations on something so basic as an omelette, but this certainly did. I also had a piece of their french toast and couldn&#39;t decide which I liked better.The dining area is small but the staff does a great job quickly clearing tables and promptly serving food to get you seated quickly without making customers feel rushed. We waited 20 minutes. The ambience definitely felt more like I was having dinner in a casual dining room as opposed to a restaurant.Bottom line: This was one of the best overall dining experiences I&#39;ve had in the city.

My fiance and his cousin both had issues holding the coffee cup, as it&#39;s shaped like a tea cup, and the handle is quite small!Since the place has a variety of southern foods, I decided to try the biscuits and gravy and a side of breakfast potatoes with cheese, jalapenos, and bacon. The biscuit itself was good, but it was so sweet, it tasted strange with the sausage gravy (which was also pretty tepid). The potatoes were much better, but almost anything tastes delicious with melted cheese and bacon.My fiance got a sausage breakfast sandwich, and he liked it. However, the only side option was applesauce- it would be nice to have the option to get potatoes or anything else. His cousin got a sampler plate, which I think is the way to go here. He liked his biscuit, but everything else was pretty mediocre. Overall, I think the biscuits are good, but not good enough to warrant a return visit.",2,1,14,0,2,5,0,12," i would actually give this place 2.5 stars if i could . : Positivei came here last saturday for brunch . : Neutraloriginally , i wanted to go to nightwood , but discovered that they only do brunch on sundays . : Negativewe were able to walk right in , but the place was crowded . : Neutralas soon as we sat down , a line formed that was out the door by the time we were finished . : Negativethe decor has n't been updated -LRB- ever -RRB- , and there 's no ambiance at all . : Negativefirst - any good brunch place has to have good coffee . : Neutralwhy would any restaurant serve seattle 's best , especially in chicago , where there are so many better options ?! : Negativegross . : Negativei did n't have an issue with the cup , but i 'm a small woman . : Neutralmy fiance and his cousin both had issues holding the coffee cup , as it 's shaped like a tea cup , and the handle is quite small ! : Negativesince the place has a variety of southern foods , i decided to try the biscuits and gravy and a side of breakfast potatoes with cheese , jalapenos , and bacon . : Negativethe biscuit itself was good , but it was so sweet , it tasted strange with the sausage gravy -LRB- which was also pretty tepid -RRB- . : Negativethe potatoes were much better , but almost anything tastes delicious with melted cheese and bacon . : Negativemy fiance got a sausage breakfast sandwich , and he liked it . : Positivehowever , the only side option was applesauce - it would be nice to have the option to get potatoes or anything else . : Negativehis cousin got a sampler plate , which i think is the way to go here . : Neutralhe liked his biscuit , but everything else was pretty mediocre . : Negativeoverall , i think the biscuits are good , but not good enough to warrant a return visit . : Negative"sweet-maple-cafe-chicago,Karthik D.,7SxzmxTCvf-d-Ni-LNf9eg,y6DB_nnHneeiz38CeMcgOA,"This is very good brunch place.

Another table seated 15 mins after us placed their order and had their food before we even placed our order.    Ok.   It&#39;s a busy Friday.    I get it.

And was about as thick as my pinky.   The sides were refrigerated and cold.    For $26 I was incredibly underwhelmed.    When the server finally did decide to visit our table, I asked if the salmon was supposed to be a half inch thick crispy biscuit.   she looked at it and said that it was the end of the fish so it was supposed to be that way.    Seemed pretty lame to me.    In fairness she did ask if I wanted something else but I&#39;m not one to fuss so I said no it&#39;s okay.

The flavors in every course were all so complimentary and distinctive.  To boot, we enjoyed the $33 pp prix fixe dining option on this Wednesday evening.  What was particularly nice for this prix fixe was that you pick whatever 3 courses you want from the regular menu, and it looked to be roughly a $12 pp discount.  It&#39;s also BYOB, and I brought in some FFF Gumballhead, but almost every other table had either wine or champagne it appeared (good for them, but beer was perfect for us).   So, I ordered up:- Housemade corn dogs (not from the ballpark, but rather made of beef short rib)- Braised beef cheek fettuccine- Cranberry bread puddingWife ordered:- Smoked eggplant appetizer- Belgian endive salad- Rainbow trout, which came with a fried egg (this was best course of all the very good ones we had).The menu photo has a much better description of the courses.  The only minor knock was the fettuccine was slightly undercooked.  Otherwise, awesome meal and a charming venue.

Home Bistro has moved into my top 5 places for dinner in Chicago. On a whim we decided to make a reservation since we were heading to an event down the street. We were able to secure a same day booking, which was nice. The space is cozy and ideal for small groups (less than 4, but ideally 2). While you could bring a large group, the place itself only seats around 50, so be careful.  The menu is amazing. There were so many great options it was hard to choose what we wanted.In terms of our meal, we got he red leaf salad, fried oysters, Amsterdam muscles, and the pork shoulder steak special. The muscles came with a huge bowl of fries, which coincidentally went really well as an accompaniment to the pork shoulder steak. I had never seen pork shoulder (still with the bone) served like a steak, but I&#39;d easily order it again. It was perfectly grilled with a creme fresh and strawberry compote on top. Very simple, yet highly flavorful.   It&#39;s BYOB, so plan accordingly. There is a 7-11 across the street if you wanted to pick up something. If you bring wine and need it chilled, they can bring a bucket out for you table side. There were only 3-4 front of house staff working, but it was perfect because HB is so small.
