currency-exchange-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/currency-exchange-cafe-chicago-2,09/15/14 , 5 ," I went to CEC yesterday for their &#34;Grits and Butter&#34; Event hosted by the Silver room. There was a lot that I liked about this place, however there was one thing that they served that I found to be  utterly horrendous so I&#39;m docking one star.Overall, I thought the music, ambiance, and seating were perfection. We had to wait awhile, but I didn&#39;t mind because everyone else waiting was so chill and the music kind of make me want to stand. The staff were also incredibly gracious and the prices on the menu were more than affordable. In general everything about the venue seemed like it was the new frontier for buppies (which is super cute). My only issue came in when the omelet that I ordered arrived white...I looked around me at other scrambled eggs/omelets being served and noticed that they were all white. In addition to being morally opposed to egg whites (all the nutrition is in the yolk!), I find the flavor to be gross and it was also visually unappealing.  I will definitely go back  and recommend it to folks(especially if they have another event), however I would specify wanting whole eggs, not egg whites. Aside from this distraction, the french toast  (dense and not too sweet) and  soul bowl that my boyfriend ordered were absolutely delicious."
half-shell-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/half-shell-chicago,08/19/13 , 5 ," Fellas...forget your fedoras at home cause they make you take your hat off inside. That&#39;s about the only thing about Half Shell that even dabbles in dress code though. It&#39;s definitely a dive-y spot so if you&#39;re absolutely against a little dirt when scarfing seafood then you may want to wander into a place with white tablecloths.If you&#39;re into saving a few bucks while still getting some quality shellfish, beers, and oysters then this place is perfect. A snow and king crab combo, seafood sandwich, a dozen oysters, and several beers equaled under $60 bucks. It was all pretty tasty too.Don&#39;t think I really need to say much more than that..."
kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,04/26/14 , 5 ," There&#39;s an air of elegance, a smart decor, and friendly wait staff (though they should not be allowed near the maître d&#39; stand--she could not find our reservation, but the hostess pulled it right up--and three cheers for taking reservations and graciously postponing for fifteen minutes when I called). And a table by the kitchen for our small group of five was sure cozy.The food was tasty, though mostly unremarkable. The Blood Orange Manhattan was exceptional: a slow dance on the tongue. Yes, the bacon-wrapped dates were done well--tantalizing to the tongue, but that&#39;s a relatively low bar. The spinach and caramelized pies were a bit doughy and didn&#39;t have as caramelized a flavor as I might have hoped. Good hummus, but definitely not as special as the waiter preached. I loved the accompaniments to the lamb shank, but it was a bit overcooked, a tad dry. The salmon was tasty, but not $28 tasty.And I guess that&#39;s the rub. I get that &#34;tapas&#34; means small plates, but these tapas were more like &#34;tapas tapas,&#34; very small plates. The hummus must have only been about 1/4 cup, 1/3 at the most. Four falafel cost nearly $2 apiece. Each time they brought pita bread (which was extremely tasty, hot and fluffy), there was only one little silver-dollar-sized-pancake-sized piece for each of us. And they didn&#39;t bring any with the hummus; so we had to wait for it. The lamb shank and salmon were larger portions, but for the price not a good value.That having been said, the service was excellent. Our server had a great sense of humor; he knew the menu well and had suggestions at the tip of his tongue. The food runners were cheery and efficient. And the menu&#39;s attention to noting gluten-free dishes made ordering a lot easier for our unfortunately-culinary-disabled friend.I&#39;ll definitely give the place another go, but my hopes were a bit higher than my experience."
la-catedral-cafe-and-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-catedral-cafe-and-restaurant-chicago-2,01/02/13 , 5 ," It&#39;s a cute little place on the corner. Sorry, but the food just wasn&#39;t good. I also thought it&#39;s a tad pricey for what you get.I didn&#39;t have high hopes when I kept hearing the microwave being used too."
cafe-53-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-53-chicago,11/05/14 , 5 , always excellent customer service and prices are very reasonable. They have great apple cider and caramel macchiatos.
mak-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mak-restaurant-chicago,03/19/14 , 5 ," I&#39;m on the in between, too~ the ABC Bowl (Awesome Broccoli Chicken) is truuuuuuly awesome! I get it with quinoa and green beans, and it&#39;s always been cooked to perfection and full of flavor. :) LOVE it.The issue is that everything else is just meh. The donuts? Meh. The other options? So meh, that I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d ordered from Mak on GrubHub before and wasn&#39;t interested in doing so again. The ABC blows me away, but it&#39;s a limited repertoire."
belly-shack-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/belly-shack-chicago-2,12/25/14 , 5 , I ordered the tostones and chimichiurri sauce. Really enjoyed it while I was eating it. Crunchy and fried to perfection. I didn&#39;t enjoy the sauce though. It was too acidic. Perhaps an aioli would have made a better pairing.Um... and then... it hit me. I think I got food poisoning from this... I&#39;m rather positive actually. I crawled up in fetal position for the rest of the evening. Thank God there&#39;s Tums.I don&#39;t think the initial gratification is worth the pain that follows.
birria-huentitan-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/birria-huentitan-restaurant-chicago,10/26/14 , 5 ," Every time I come here on a drunken Mexican food excursion and wait in line to order I&#39;m hit with a wave if nostalgia from my teenage years.I discovered Huentitan when I was about 13 or 14 years old and in the early years of my rebellious stage. After a night of drinking, this was thee taco joint to hit up at 1,2,3 in the morning. After all, McDonald&#39;s is nowhere near as satisfying as a greasy, delicious steak taco.The ambience is straight hood especially if your out after dark. After all, the freaks come out at night. You WILL be greeted by drunken, money begging drug addicts as soon as u walk up to the front door. Once inside you will wait in line to order your taco. You WILL be surrounded by a number of Gang members, drunken fools, sleazy women and sometimes even  prostitutes and pimps. But if you are wasted it will all be a blur and you wouldn&#39;t be worried. DO NOT EAT IN.I always order tacos although I hear they make a bomb ass burrito. Definitely come here after a long night of drinking you will be glad you did."
francos-ristorante-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/francos-ristorante-chicago,04/24/11 , 5 ," Franco&#39;s was one of the first places I ever visited based upon its Yelp reviews. I was a newbie back in the summer of 2009 when the BF and I were at a game at US Cellular. Before heading back to our hotel downtown, we wanted to grab some local grub, so we entrusted Yelp...and we were not let down!We worked up quite the appetite walking the streets of the Bridgeport neighborhood to find the place (and then fortunately were able to walk off our filling meal while on our way back to the train).I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting, but Franco&#39;s was not what I expected...but in a good way. It was a quaint little hole-in-the-wall place that felt like we were stepping into someone&#39;s home more than we were into a restaurant. It has a cute vintage bistro type of ambiance, and I dig that because it wasn&#39;t trying to be some pretentious Italian novelty. If I lived in Chicago, I think Franco&#39;s would be my destination of choice for a gathering of friends or a book club discussion (I know...totally random). So on to the food...It was VERY good. The BF and I decided to split the Rigatoni Arrabiatta with a side of Italian Sausage for a spicier kick. It is somewhat familiar dish for us, so I feel that I can gauge the flavor well in comparison to others we&#39;ve tried elsewhere. Everything tasted almost homemade, but yet better--Even the bread was above par. The portions were the perfect size for us to share, and I felt the price was extremely reasonable--only about $15 for the main dish plus the side order.The service was great too--there was only one server covering the whole room, and she kept busy, however, we were never left waiting for anything, even though we were tucked away in a quiet little corner (it was kinda romantic). This place is a little off the beaten path, but I would definitely dine here again before or after a Sox game, as it&#39;s a nice departure from the typical experience downtown."
moons-sandwich-shop-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/moons-sandwich-shop-chicago,02/26/14 , 5 ," Some days you just have to have a really great Corned Beef Sandwich,and today was just one of those days!Now, I researched Corned Beef Restaurants through/on Yelp and I readMoon&#39;s reviews and thought I&#39;d really like to give this place a try.So glad I did, because it definitely did not disappoint!Now, today being my first time at Moon&#39;s I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect,so here&#39;s what I found.This place is Rocking with Customers! They have counter space fordining in but me thinks they do one hell of a great take out business.There was a steady flow of customers coming through the door duringthe whole time I was there.They have a pretty big staff of servers/cooks at Moon&#39;s, nice peopleworking here at Moon&#39;s.They have a great menu filled with Breakfast Items, Burgers, Soups,and for the record some of the best Chili Mac ever which I brought homeand devoured.Gotta say, their Corned Beef Sandwich is giant in size and so very good,they give you a choice of bread and toppings too.And, I met Henry the Cook because he came up to me and introducedhimself to me, we talked about the 60&#39;s and hippies, yadda, yadda..But Henry made me promise to come back to Moon&#39;s and Holler at himLook at me.. 52 and men still want me to holler.. hey..hey..Anyway, I truly loved what I got from Moon&#39;s today which was good  service,great food and an Introduction to Henry.Moon&#39;s is located on Madison and Western here in Chicago, okay,not the best hood but hey, I&#39;ll make a trip back One Day..Hey,it&#39;s worth a Holler..:)"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,10/01/14 , 5 ," Wahhh I was sooo looking forward to eating here because of the reviews! However, our venture here lead us to a disappointing dinner.We ordered a bunch of nigiri (amaebi, albacore, uni, hotate aburi (seared scallop), king crab, wagyu aburi, foie gras, maguro, and salmon volcano aburi). We also ordered the ikebukuro, oyako don, and hamachi jalapeno.The nigiri was whatever, the uni and fish weren&#39;t as fresh as I expected. I would not order to foie gras again, despite my love for it, but as a nigiri it was just way too rich and buttery to take down on its own. The amaebi was a bit mushier than what I prefer. And the heads were cold by the time they came out and soggy from the sauce. It probably would have been better if it was delivered fresh out of the fryer. Everything else was just average. I would recommend two things we had: the hotate aburi and the ikebukuro. Those two were pretty good, the best out of our meal.Prices were expensive though, in my opinion. about $3-4 per piece of sashimi/nigiri. I&#39;m used to it being 2 pieces per order. And for that price, I expected something very fresh and high quality.They also only had 3 orders of uni left?! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?! So we ended up fighting over the three, but it honestly wasn&#39;t worth the fight. It wasn&#39;t super fresh and you can tell it was frozen.Service was good. Our server was very quiet and polite. They also had these cool towels that when water is poured on they expand!The ambiance was very trendy. Nice tables, decorations, and plating.But for the price we paid, I could definitely get way better sushi back home in SF.Another downside is that we had to choose between here and Lawrence Fish Market. I now regret our choice to come here and should have gone for the cheaper option which is probably the same quality sushi."
dianas-food-and-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dianas-food-and-restaurant-chicago,11/09/14 , 5 , If Heaven were a place on Earth! This little gem is right near my house and I couldn&#39;t be happier. YUMMMM!
fatsos-last-stand-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fatsos-last-stand-chicago-2,11/13/14 , 5 ," Had the Fatso double burger- it was OK- I would compare it to In-N-Out..Just the burger with tax was over seven bucks- a bit pricy for what it was.My first visit, next time I will have a char-dog which looked good on the fire as I was watching the burger cook..A big plus in my book, they have a parking lot in the back, and a nice outdoor seating area when the weather is good enough for that."
oasis-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oasis-cafe-chicago,04/30/14 , 5 ," Truly a hidden gem within a jewelry mart. Definitely not known to tourist. You know you&#39;ve struck gold when locals and mostly muddle eastern clients lest here. Ordered the falafel sandwich and hubby ordered a chicken kebab. The hummus was NOT gritty!!! Smooth as butter.The place is small but the portions are big and delicious. If we had a bigger appetite, we would have ordered lentil soup. Pure bliss. Will be back."
ciao-amore-ristorante-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ciao-amore-ristorante-chicago-3,06/03/11 , 5 ," Their spinach pesto, asiago and ricotta gnocchi is why you go here. It may read like a wild combination, but after having gnocchi prepared this way, I wonder why the hell it isn&#39;t served more often in other restaurants because I&#39;ve not had it taste better! There&#39;s a smooth, buttery envelope around the fat noodles that hold a pocket of spinach and cheesy goodness that HAS to be the perfect, bitterly-cold winter comfort dish. And this was on on a very evening in early June. All I&#39;m gonna say.We&#39;d passed this quaint, Pilsen BYO several times going to and from Simone&#39;s Bar and this was the perfect summer&#39;s night to give it a try. Cesar and his staff will make sure and frequently that you&#39;re being served and that you have everything you need. You won&#39;t be ignored."
native-foods-cafe-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/native-foods-cafe-chicago-3,10/21/14 , 5 ," Vegan, psh... I need my meat.Price: Reasonable. It cost me about $13 for a meal and dessert.Parking: Not sure, we walked on ova.Service: Order, pay up front, and seat yourself. The staff didn&#39;t seem too ecstatic about life, but it was also a gloomy rainy Tuesday evening.Food &amp; Drinks: I ordered the tacos ($9ish) and drenched them in tobacco sauce. I enjoyed my meal very much. For dessert, I had the peanut butter pudding ($3.50ish), but that was overly sweet. I also sipped on the Watermelon drink which I VERY MUCH enjoyed. It was so fresh &amp; not too sweet.Notes: I appreciate the gluten free and etc. markings they have on their menu. They have a point reward system.. For every dollar you spend you get a pt, and when you reach $200 pts you get...... something good?Overall: I actually enjoyed this place very much. It had a clean feel to it and the food was very tasty. I would def come again."
travelle-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/travelle-chicago,05/21/14 , 5 ," My friend and I stopped in here for lunch today because I&#39;ve been hearing amazing things about their burger and, since my tag line is &#34;burger inspector&#34;, I figured I had to verify the claims about this creation. I was not disappointed. It was extremely juicy but had a nice crispy finish. The Mahon cheese (reminds me of Austin Mahone!) and the pickled onions brought some different bright flavors to the combo. There were also dried tomatoes, lettuce, and a secret sauce of some sort. I think it was a pepper aioli. The french fries were well seasoned and on the crispy side, just how I like them. Although it was pricier than my normal lunch, it was such a nice treat on this beautiful day to enjoy a great hamburger. Now it&#39;s time for my food coma!"
benjyehuda-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/benjyehuda-chicago-2,10/20/13 , 5 ," The service was quick and fast, although it was about 2PM and they close at 3.I ordered the falafel bowl. Inside, they were green and vibrant. Everything that I ordered tasted fresh. I wish I had ordered more rice (hey, I&#39;m Asian) instead of lettuce because I ended up ordering two portions of lettuce. Hah. I wish they had given me more hot sauce, but everything with the hummus on top made it all very tasty and not too dry.I look forward to coming back here again for lunch!"
rickshaw-republic-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rickshaw-republic-chicago,05/11/14 , 5 ," Overall: Very interesting and unique cuisine, with great prices, atmosphere, and taste. Quite a gem in the neighborhood.The good: Great tasting food that seems very authentic. Lots of unique indonesian options that I&#39;ve never tried. Great prices and a decent sized menu. Good sized portions. Atmosphere is unique and interesting.The bad: The service was very questionable. Waited for awhile, the service was friendly but sparse once we were seated. The restaurant was cold too. Took awhile for our food as well.Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 7/10Food: 9/10"
la-sirena-clandestina-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-sirena-clandestina-chicago,11/01/14 , 5 ," Great dinner at La Sirena last night! I think because it was Halloween on a Friday, the restaurant wasn&#39;t overly busy. I dined with my husband and we went the shared plates route with our choices.Empanadas--ordered both the meat and veggie versions. The former was cheeseburger themed and the latter was...veggie something. Both were a delicious start to our meal!La Bomba Rice--realllllly good and the chiles give it a nice kick. It&#39;s a sizable portion and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered it along with one of the larger entrees. I don&#39;t know that it would be good as just an entree on its own though as in that form it might be kind of boring.Lobster tail and chicken--loved this entree. The lobster was nice and buttery, the chicken good and crispy skinned, and the rice both came with had a great flavor too.Cheese bread--I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting, but what came out were 4 balls resembling hushpuppies. They were tasty and I would definitely recommend them. We got them along with our entrees but I actually think they&#39;d be a great as another small appetizer with the empanadas.As far as drinks, we had the caipirinha and pisco sour. Both classics were well made. Service was friendly (and dressed in costumes for the holiday!) and attentive."
river-valley-farmers-table-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/river-valley-farmers-table-chicago-3,04/21/14 , 5 ," OMG!!!! Why couldn&#39;t this place have opened sooner!? I&#39;m almost speechless...-excellent food (I am dreaming about their biscuits and mushroom gravy with 2 poached eggs)-easily made a dish for my friend with aLot of dietary restrictions-friendly and helpful staff were able to describe the dishes, make recommendations and make us laugh.-local and farm fresh-connected to a store worn lots ofLocal goodies. I highly recommend the cheeses and granola!The one bummer here is that I love my chocolate/sweets and they have desserts from local farms or bakeries but they are not very fresh. My friend said she tried a cupcake weeks before and it was dry. The cashier really talked up the chocolate chip cookie with sea salt and it looked delicious so I caved. It was dry and hard and the chocolate chips were slightly whitish (old). The taste was good so I really wish it would have been fresh but I had to throw it away. :("
fat-rice-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fat-rice-chicago,12/01/14 , 5 ," This was our second time dining at Fat Rice- the first time being 8 months ago before they developed their reservations system.  The hubby surprised me with reservations here and I was so happy! I loved this restaurant the first time and hoped that it would be just as good this time.My fave dish remains the Fat Noodles in XO sauce. Love the chewy noodles in the savory sauce.  Another great dish is the piri piri chicken. Good for sharing, very tasty and definitely order it with the coconut rice.Under the specials we ordered the 3 for $10 bites including the pig ears, tofu and mushrooms and clams. We also got the shredded squash, which was alright but made us very full by the time the piri piri chicken and coconut rice came out.Service was very good and attentive. Overall, Fat Rice was as good as we remembered and we hope to be back soon with friends so that we can order the namesake dish, Arroz Gordo (Fat Rice)."
saucy-porka-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/saucy-porka-chicago,12/30/14 , 5 ," I saw the menu and I had to stop by on my visit to Chicago! I was not very hungry when I came (already had lunch) but decided to have a second lunch since the items seemed small anyways.I started with the Chorizo Egg Roll. This was good and unique. I liked the avocado aioli, but I wouldn&#39;t say this is as mind blowing as other reviews make it out to be.Then, I ordered the Miso Braised Beef Short Rib baco. This was really good! The short rib was very soft and just falls apart in your mouth like it should. The marinade is yummy too and I really liked the pineapple salsa to complement it.I wasn&#39;t hesitant about getting dessert but I really wanted to try the Azuki Beignet. This was definitely a miss for me. The beignets weren&#39;t soft and fluffy as I had imagined - but I guess I am spoiled after visiting Cafe du Monde in New Orleans. The dough seemed a bit dry.Service was very friendly though and the place was busy!"
the-matchbox-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-matchbox-chicago,01/10/14 , 5 ," If we could, both Rob Thomas and I would give this place 20 stars. Since we can&#39;t 5 will have to cover it.Not necessarily applicable in this winter weather, but the patio is pretty dope with way more seating on the sidewalk then inside the bar itself. Until a warmer climate comes you&#39;&#39;ll have to fight for one of the maybe 30 spots inside, but if you&#39;re lucky enough to get one you&#39;ll enjoy awesome drinks cheaper than almost any craft cocktail bar in town.Perfect to post up at alone and enjoy some convo with the bartenders or bring a date to showcase your coolness. Matchbox makes for an awesome spot to start off a night of almost any occasion if you&#39;re not rolling with a deep crowd."
aquitaine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aquitaine-chicago,06/11/13 , 5 ," I took my parents here for an early dinner on Sunday night and we loved our meals. I started with the prosecco cocktail (had some fig pepper liqueur mixed in which was really unique and delicious). For an appetizer, I got the scallops, which were really perfectly cooked and on a bed of peppery risotto with some grilled fennel. The flavors all came together beautifully. I then ordered the fish en papillote. The fish was mahi mahi and it was served in a parchment paper wrap with carrots and leeks. Very light but very tasty.My parents also had fish dishes: the ratatouille and the salmon with mushrooms. All in all it was a delightful meal and I&#39;d love to go back!"
beezzee-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beezzee-chicago,04/07/14 , 5 ," Oh my to the chocolate cream with walnut dessert crepe. We don&#39;t seem to have a lot of crepes here on the North Shore, so I was thrilled to locate this little gem near my old hood in Chicago.I&#39;m having a sweet tooth week. After a meeting I popped in here and was really surprised at locating this little gem. It&#39;s super adorable!...and delicious!So I ordered the chocolate cream with walnut dessert crepe. I figured it would be tiny. Boy was I wrong - it was ginormous! Lucky lucky me. Loaded with whipped cream, chocolate and walnuts, I thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to finish it, but it was light and airy and each bite was better than the next.I had a sample of one of their fruit smoothies, and on my way out they treated me to a sample of their brand of Italian coffee Lavazza. It was smooth and didn&#39;t need a pinch of sweetener. Next time I&#39;m in the neighborhood I&#39;ll be scoring a coffee along with my crepe.The wife of the owner is lovely and really knows how to take care of her customers. The place is so clean you could eat off the floors. And, it&#39;s just so cute! Love the cluster of hanging lights over each table.A breathe of fresh air. Now, if only they would open up a second location to the North Shore so I can visit you all the time!"
the-franklin-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-franklin-room-chicago,12/14/14 , 5 ," Definitely could become a regular here if you like salt. And I do. I rather expect it on a smoked fish plate, as well as in a burger that boasts a sheet of bacon. The surf-n-turf burger takes up prime real estate on the plate. It&#39;s enormous. That stated, our portion of soft shell crab was deficient compared to a comp I just spied. At $18.00, it&#39;s at the higher end of price points I&#39;ve paid for a burger outside of a resort, but, even crab-sparse, it was wagyu, delicious and otherwise ample. It comes with fresh waffle fries - again high on your salt-o-meter.Cauliflower tots are the best new way I know to &#34;get your veggies.&#34; So lightly and expertly battered but again, theme rich. Quite salty! A little surprising. Not that one needs any inspiration for the Whisky Boy to go down, but the tots certainly motivate you to the glass.Downstairs and intimately lit, I can&#39;t slap &#34;speakeasy&#34; on it-  especially when music is cranking and there&#39;s the radiating glow of a flat screen over the bar. The interior has modern lines combined with an old school charm. As you may expect, not an abundance of natural light though the wide stairs and wrought iron railing nicely showcase what light you do have at the entrance.Service was prompt and friendly. Don&#39;t let yourself get seated at the entrance to the kitchen. Terrible feng shui there; I imagine could screw up your chi for the rest of your life. Almost had to pull out of the deal when hostess went that direction. Wonderfully inviting interior, save for those couple of tables.The food menu covers a wide range (keen on trying mushroom soup and shrimp bisque next time!) and you surely won&#39;t be disappointed by the fine and vast selection of imbibables. Cheers!"
dawali-mediterranean-kitchen-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dawali-mediterranean-kitchen-chicago-2,10/31/14 , 5 ," I had the pleasure of meeting beautiful Chicago Yelper (and former DC Yelper), Amanda S here for lunch one Friday afternoon. The restaurant was empty sans one other table. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to a table. The server was very nice and attentive.For appetizers, we shared the hummus, pita and greek fries. These were the best greek fries I&#39;ve ever had, the sauce was amazing. The fries were hot and crisp and covered in feta and spices. For the entree, I got the chicken shawerma platter and Amanda got the chicken shawerma wrap/sandwich. Both were delicious although the shawerma platter came with a lot more food, to include rice and a salad. The chicken was juicy and flavorful.The best part of the meal was the price. You get a lot of delicious food here for a very affordable price. I definitely recommend this place if you are in Chicago. Can&#39;t wait to go back"
jims-original-hot-dog-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jims-original-hot-dog-chicago,12/13/14 , 5 ," Not sure if I was really hungry or if Jim&#39;s is just that great! My friend brought me after my flight landed at 1am. It was so freaking cold and we were just standing outside eating our polish dogs!The polish dogs are good, especially since they add carmelized onions. I don&#39;t normally like mustard, but I didn&#39;t mind having them in this. The polish dog also comes with a side of fries that are piping hot! They are so fresh and yummy. Especially when it&#39;s so cold outside!The best part is that the polish dog is $4 and Jim&#39;s is opened 24/7! Very satisfying and inexpensive for a late night meal."
golden-thai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-thai-chicago,06/14/14 , 5 ," First visit to Golden Thai tonight.  Overall I was very pleased with the food and service.We were out doing some shopping and heading home so we decided to try something new in the neighborhood we&#39;ve never been to.  Once I turned on to Taylor I took the very first parking spot I saw.  Let&#39;s be honest Saturday night can get pretty crazy on Taylor.We jumped out of the car and walked into the first place we saw.  There was only one other diner so that may have had something to do with the quick personalized service we received.  None the less our service was prompt and attentive.We tried the chicken satay for an appetizer.  The chicken was served hot and was very well seasoned.  The peanut sauce it came with really set it off.For our meals we had Singapore noodles which contained shrimp, pork, bean sprouts, and very then noodles.  The dish was also served very hot and was flavorful.  The portion was very large and filling.  We also tried the yellow curry.  The dish again was served very hot and was bursting with flavor.  The only thing to critique would be the thickness of the sauce was on the thin side so it wasn&#39;t the heartiest version of this dish I&#39;ve tried.The meal was $25 or a lot of food for a good price.  I would most likely try this place again and suggest it to friends looking for Thai."
ruxbin-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ruxbin-chicago,11/09/14 , 5 ," I &#34;get&#34; why people love Ruxbin. It&#39;s a small neighborhood restaurant that appears to be a gem in West Town. It&#39;s local, not commercialized, not owned by a restaurant group. It&#39;s one of those neighborhood places that people love to love. And, it&#39;s BYO so I can see how it gets brownie points from people.The food though for me, while it was good, it didn&#39;t blow me away. Also, I rarely comment on pricing but felt the need to here. $32 for the sea bass entree. It came as a small piece that could be finished in 4-5 bites. Not even at least a fillet size for that price? I can get a whole fish for about $10 more at other finer dining restaurants.There&#39;s too much effort needed to dine here (limited reservations, mostly walk-ins, and out of the way location) to make me want to return."
the-bristol-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bristol-chicago,07/17/14 , 5 ," I&#39;m new to this neighborhood and slowly but surely I&#39;m trying to pick my way through all the local spots. The Bristol was amazing. I went by myself and sat the bar for dinner. Next time, I plan to bring more people to share and try even more dishes.The bartender Shawn was great. He was very friendly and helped me settle on my selection. He&#39;s obviously a foodie himself and had great recommendations. I pretty much settled on the most popular items this first time around.I started with a  cocktail (of course!) and tried the Poire and Elderflower which is listed as a &#34;Bristol Classic&#34;. It was refreshing, sweet but not too sweet. A great start to a great meal.The Monkey Bread is just as yummy as everyone said. Soft, fresh bread balls that you dip in dill butter. I could go back and just eat two orders of this. No problem. The Duck Fat Fries are also a must have. They come with house made ketchup and garlic aioli. The aioli was my favorite part. When I had leftovers to pack up, I was super excited to see he had thrown in some more aioli for later. I also ordered the Raviolo. I might add that the fries also taste delicious dipped in the Raviolo&#39;s butter sauce.The atmosphere is great. The food was amazing. The service was friendly and knowledgeable."
carbon-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/carbon-chicago,05/22/14 , 5 ," I discovered this place while I was at the Taste of Chicago. Even though I live relatively close to this place, I would go to Ricebene&#39;s instead. I&#39;m glad I tried them at the Taste, but when I went to the actual restaurant it was a different story.I tried their fish tacos and they were awesome. Their horchata isn&#39;t half bad either. I would go back just for the fish tacos, but they are a bit pricey.However, one time I went I brought two of my friends with me and I was served, but they ended up losing the tickets for my two friends. I guess it was because they got busy/ We waited over an hour for our food, but I don&#39;t understand why no one helped us since we were sitting down and not eating and just staring back at them. My friends got two horchatas for free.I didn&#39;t go back after this because it is in a busy part of the neighborhood and I felt like the taste of their fish tacos weren&#39;t going to beat the terrible service that my friends received from this place."
kokos-mediterranean-grille-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kokos-mediterranean-grille-chicago,08/03/14 , 5 ," TASTE TESTERMy girls were hungry but I wasn&#39;t totally starving. So we stopped in here for a few sandwiches.This location use to be a great dirty greasy spoon place. In fact, this was my go to place for a cheap omelette on Sunday mornings. But that old place is gone and this new clean Mediterranean style place is here. It is the sign of the times in West Town. As the neighborhood gets better the businesses look better. I must say that they did do a nice job with fixing up the place but I do miss my seedly little breakfast dive.We ordered a Cheeseburger and a Chicken shawarma. As the taste tester, I was allowed to secure photos for Yelp and two bites per sandwich. I believe we negotiated one bite but I used my persuasive charm to get a second bite.The cheeseburger was really good. It tastes exactly like a portillos char burger. If I was a betting man I would even say they get there meat from the same supplier. The taste was very unique. All I could think was my little one was very lucky getting to enjoy that whole burger. I would definitely come back for one of these.My wife had the chicken shawarma and I thought it was good. Is it the best one I&#39;ve ever had? No. Would I order it again from here? Probably not. The sandwich was beautiful and nicely laid out like a gyro but the chicken could have been a little more tastier.The staff was very friendly and it was very crowded the night we came here. The outdoor patio was jam packed full of people. The cooks were working their butts off trying to get food out to everyone.I would like to come back and explore more of the menu. This is one of those places that is still fast food at heart but looks like fast causal. The remodeling job was amazing and it will draw in a nicer crowd. But never forget that his place was once a dirty hole in the wall. The good news is no matter which place it is it&#39;s turning out good fast food."
pump-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pump-room-chicago,12/24/14 , 5 ," Great drinks at ridiculous prices.Although the hipsters have almost migrated through this stop, there are still a few herds who have not heard that the Pump Room is no longer &#34;in&#34;. Once they do, it will probably move up to a 5 star.The care taken when my Old Fashioned (with Bulleit rye, of course) was made was matched by the Tito&#39;s vodka-based concoction made for Gal Pal. Both drinks were delicious and immediately commanded that they be savored, not swallowed.Go in knowing that you will be paying a stupid-expensive price for some very good drinks (and very good ambience once the hipster migration has completed) and enjoy!"

brankos-sandwich-shop-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brankos-sandwich-shop-chicago,06/13/14 , 5 , This is an awesome sandwich shop. The students at Depaul certainly have it good here! I truly enjoyed the ginormous grilled chicken sandwich served on a kaiser roll that was made to order. I have never seen such a high quality grilled chicken sandwich. Very nice family owned shop. Would love to come back again to try their other items like the chicago dog and italian beef.
masa-azul-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/masa-azul-chicago,07/13/14 , 5 ," One of my colleagues likes to say that no matter what when eating out in Chicago, for any given price point, some of the best restaurants are Mexican.  Masa Azul could be a case in point.The food was just great, through and through.  Shrimp cocktail had flavorful chunks of shrimp and avocado in a flavorful, herby, gazpacho-like tomato broth.  Chile de arbol salsa was thick, deep, and spicy, with excellent extremely fresh chips.  Goat tacos and the pork in pineapple sauce were both flavorful, interesting, and satisfying.  And a roasted-mushroom huarache was the true standout.  There aren&#39;t a lot of vegetarian items on the menu, but I would take a vegeterian here just to eat these mushrooms.But even better than the great food were the cocktails.  I have never had so many uniformly delicious and interesting things done with mezcal.  Mezcal cooked into wood chips, mezcal mixed with campari and hibiscus rimmed with habanero salt, mezcal with a mysteriously intense and unsweetened orange juice.  (The cocktails without mezcal were delicious too.)  Everything we tried -- the make-your-own-cocktail, the tropical cocktails, the flight of wood-aged cocktails -- was a knockout success.I can&#39;t yet say it&#39;s better than the Violet Hour, which might win on sheer impeccable variety, but it&#39;s better than the best cocktails I&#39;ve had in almost any other city."
pollo-express-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pollo-express-chicago-2,11/11/14 , 5 ," My 100th REVIEW! WOOOOOI make a WEEKLY visit to this place. ALL THEY DO IS CHICKEN. [i think] and damnnnnn do they do it well. On Tuesdays and Thursdays they have buy one chicken combo and get a half chicken for free [2 limit per customer] Word of advice, they will tell you it takes 40 minutes, but give them an hour before you go in to pick up your food.  The place always has a line. just accept it. You will still have to wait about 10 minutes even if you call it in early. haha.On to the food. When you walk in your see they are grilling about 45 chickens at one time. It is NUTS! The combo comes with a huge container of rice and refried beans AND tortillas. The chicken is enough for about 3 hungry or 4 tiny people. There is so much chicken. It is grilled to... perfection. The chicken is butterflied, it has a lot of bones in it but so worth just MUNCHING THRU IT! nom nom nom. The chicken is super tender and juicy. I just like to pull allll the chicken off the bone and make mini tacos with rice, beans, salsa and caramelized onions.anyway, if you are in the pilsen area, want some cheap meat, go to pollo express.  [All for $15 bucks!] Basically 5 bucks a person."

We came here super early at 11:30AM, when they were just opened. There were a few others having their early lunch as well. This place had two sections: deli and cafe. They also prepared the meats downstairs. You would pass by if you went downstairs to use the restroom.We had Return Of The Gyro: with braised pork belly, raita, escalivada, pea shoots and calabrian chili vinaigrette on griddled flatbread, and Cocido: smoked chorizo, braised beef, blood sausage, chickpeas, potatoes, cabbage, carrots and mojo picon.I would like to try the cold-cuts and the Publican restaurant across street."

Both were tasty. I don&#39;t generally like cucumber but that drink was really refreshing.For our entrees, I had the pork belly tacos and my friend had chicken mole. Both were incredibly delicious and though tiny in size, they packed in so much flavor that three was (almost) enough for a full meal. I definitely plan to come back and will add a side dish!"

I stop in at least once a week for a taste of their delicious tacos!I have tasted every single taco on the menu and every single one is consistently delicious. Each comes with its own salsa, which are all flavorful and addictive. My favorites are the al pastor and the shrimp. The quesadillas are small so order 2 if you are hungry.If the chicken tortilla soup is on the menu, GET IT! One of the best I&#39;ve had, and I have had many."
wood-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-chicago,10/17/14 , 5 ," Came to Wood with friends to kick off Sunday Funday and had a good time, but I can only give this place 3 stars. The reason why I&#39;m giving Wood 3 stars is because the brunch menu seems limited. There wasn&#39;t many items on the brunch menu that I felt I had to try so I just got the cheeseburger. I will say the cheeseburger was flavorful and juicy, but wasn&#39;t that good that I could give Wood more than 3 stars. I definitely need to come back for dinner to try more of their dishes."
bistrot-zinc-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistrot-zinc-chicago,07/29/14 , 5 ," Took the gf here for her birthday.  Booked it on opentable and me tioned it hthere that it was her bday.  Two hours before our reservation I had to push it back a couple of hours and so I called and the hostess made it happen which was great  - especially since it was a Friday night. Upon arrival the host and hostess wished my gf a happy bday which was really nice and they saved a table for us in the very crowded restaurant right next to the window.  Well done Zinc peeps!  The Pork Milanese was amazing.  The gf had the trout on spinach and she liked it as I did, but she liked my pork dish better.  Chocolate cake was great and came with a birthday candle too - very classy.  Great atmosphere and experience - we will be back soon."
dryhop-brewers-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dryhop-brewers-chicago,11/24/14 , 5 ," Hm.  I may need to reassess DryHop in the future.I visited on a Sunday around noon and ordered the burger (blended from brisket and short rib with chile-tomato jam, raw milk cheddar, arugula, pickled sweet onions, and optional - nay, mandatory - bacon.)While the burger itself was pretty juicy and phenomenal, I thought the &#34;raw milk cheddar&#34; was disgustingly rich.  When I bite down into a burger, I don&#39;t want something with the consistency of a Cadbury creme egg oozing through my teeth.  A little of that cheese would be okay.  Instead, I felt like it totally drowned the natural flavor of everything else on my plate.Fries were exceedingly bland.  I didn&#39;t care for the chipotle ketchup or the dijon aioli they supplied.I suspect I may like DryHop more on future visits, but on this go &#39;round, the burger was far too rich for my tastes."

Dave.&#34; If it&#39;s your first time to southern comfort food, &#34;The Saint&#34; would be a safe choice. It simply consists of two pieces of fried chicken complimented with two waffles. Syrup is served to the side with the butter happily melting away on your waffles.If you&#39;re more of an adventurer and tolerant of cuisines beyond your norms, give &#34;L.A. Dave&#34; a try. It&#39;s a huge platter of fried gizzards and/or livers with a side of grits and biscuit. If you don&#39;t like oatmeal, then you might also dislike grits. I am not a fan of either. The biscuit was fluffy, flaky, and soft. I could&#39;ve easily downed half a dozen of them. The fried gizzards and liver were marvelous with the hot sauce but I think it would&#39;ve been hazardous had I devoured the whole plate. For future references, I would opt to order an entrée but also get a side of fried gizzards.The macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and beans with rice were also notable.Parking can be fairly easy to find. We parked in front of the restaurant both times. Service was efficient and superb."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,02/08/13 , 5 ," Delicious brunch! If you plan on going, understand the parking situation is pretty dismal. Like, real bad. We had made a reservation but definitely did not need it at 11:30 on a Saturday morning. They brew their own coffee and it was fantastic, very bold. Aidan L. thought that the breakfast quinoa sounded interesting, so we ordered this to start. I liked the idea, but you can&#39;t really hide the taste of quinoa or pretend that it&#39;s as tasty as oatmeal.For brunch, I ordered the salmon hash and was incredibly pleased with my decision. The flavor of the salmon and herbs was awesome, absolutely recommend this dish. The boyfriend created his own omelet and it was gargantuan. He thought it was good, but nothing amazing. There was a lot of egg, but not a ton of fillings. The toast that came with it, however, WAS amazing. Thick bread with unbelievable raspberry preserves, this tasted more like cake than toast. The real reason for my drop down to four stars is the service. Our waiter was friendly, but was MIA for what felt like years. Tables around us were sat, ate, and left in the time we were at Kingsbury. He was just nowhere to be found for most of the meal. I&#39;d like to come back to try some of their sweet breakfast options and the baked items in the front looked spectacular."

My first choice was the place below Francesca&#39;s, but it was closed for a private event.We were seated promptly, and the service was really top notch. We had the calamari for an appetizer, and it was very good.  Light and crispy, and a generous serving.I had the risotto that was on special and my date had the spinach ravioli. Both were prepared perfectly and were delicious.I only had a few small complaints. Pepsi products instead of coke. And the bread served was not good at all.Price was a little high, but expected for the area.Overall a great dinner and a great night out."

First off, free and available parking outside. A definitely plus.For a Wednesday night, it was pretty quiet. We had a big group (and a reservation), so there were no problems there. They have a nice drink menu. I ordered the Hibiscus cocktail. It tasted a lot like a margarita - very good and strong for the price. I also tried the sangria which was good as well.We split the loaded fries and empanadas. Everything was great (especially the loaded fries...we got three orders. No judging). I ordered the duck tacos. Simple but very good. And filling (after apps and drinks). Also, the sides are like meals!! The mac and cheese was seriously amazing, and huge. Totally worth the money. The chimichurri fries were good, but I thought it was going to be more like a sauce. It was more like a dusting of spices on top.Service was great. Out waitress always had drinks on the table, the food came out in a timely manner, and plates were cleared. Also, not related to service, they have a sweet mural on the wall that I&#39;m in love with.If you check in on the Yelp app, you get 10% off your bill as well."

I like the feel of the place when you walk in. Dim, romantic, sexy, perfect for a hot date. BUT I didn&#39;t have one of those so.....moving on.The five of us shared 3 pizzas and we each got a flight of wines. They have a very nice variety. Red wines, white wines, etc., etc. I went with the red because red just goes ridiculously well with any dinner.Then we ordered the pizzas:Margherita - Fiore di Latte (Fresh Mozzarella) and BasilSalsiccia - sausage, roasted peppers, fiore di latte, basilSpinach - ricotta, goat cheese, spinach, toasted garlicCan you guys guess which was my fav? The Salsiccia! Pretty much anything with meat always gets my vote. The other two were really good but not as good as the Salsiccia, plus the name just sounds cooler. It was the perfect amount of spicy and cheesy. Just a great flavor over all. The crust wasn&#39;t as crispy as I would have wanted it but the flavor made up for it.We were all ready to order more but we opted for the gelati instead. Sea Salt caramel and Pistachio. Both drool worthy.The service was good, the waitress suggested our wines and one of my friends was very impressed with them that she went out and bought some.Needless to say I would definitely visit this place again. Hopefully with a date next time. ;)"

I didn&#39;t know what to expect and I was. But you are soon made comfortable and welcome- just like a guest in somebody&#39;s home, which you basically are. I was so thankful I didn&#39;t bring a first date here. Definitely come with someone you know pretty well.For the 2 pm brunch seating, you are welcomed into the living room and allowed to sit with some chips and dip, which was delicious. Then you are led downstairs for about 5 tables, where you may be sitting next to a potential new friend. There are a couple two seaters, one of which I grabbed because I wanted to catch up with my dining companion.The owner and chef then describes each of the many dishes and you are set loose on the food, which is delicious. I filled up on rice and beans, and pork, and plantains, and pineapple, and everything else. The dessert, a raspberry cake/flan concoction, was probably the most incredible thing I have ever eaten and I would return just for that. We used a Groupon, but even for the regular price of $30 a person, the quality and quantity of food, as well as the unique experience, is absolutely worth it."

Yesterday me and some friends (that obviously don&#39;t like working) went here to peruse the librations after brunch.It was a little chilly but we opted to sit outside in the patio at one of the many picnic benches. It was a cute set up and I like the art work on the fences.Our server was wonderful and put up with one of our group members indecisiveness and help him come up with the drink he wanted. Me and my girl opted for the backyard shandy cocktail and it was very light and refreshing. Next time I&#39;ll be back to try the food, but I was really digging the vibe here."

Am I the only one who knows it? He poured me water offered me the paper to read, whilst my meal was in the works. He kept consulting me to get the correct heat for each dish. When the bill came it was totaled out so I left a few dollars on the table. This guy deserves a tip the least.The Tom Yum was just that YUM. The heat perfect, if I lived here in the winter I would buy a 55 gallon barrel of this for the house. Panang was authentic and not Jiff on rice. Again even carried out, the Pad Thai was spot on! Best Thai since Pucket last year, and oh so much closer.Another on foot adventure for awesome food, I figure it took me twice as long to find than was needed.A unassuming building and decore, small and Saturday night at 7 I was it the third patron.? Super friendly staff took my BYOB to keep it cold.Tom Yum Seafood was 10$, dining alone thought I could take leftovers home. It came in a hot pot and was HUGE. The broth was a 10! Perfect medium hot,  it was cathartic. The ingredients with a few shortcoming like the addition of surimi, jalapeño, and Italian basilThe med/hot Pad Thai chicken was plenty hot but best light and flavorful! Pad Thai should be more like a salad than a pasta. You should taste but not see the sauce. Perfect!"

I got the Tocino (marinated pork shoulder) and Bangus (fish) combo platter. It came with lugao (congee or porridge), 2 sunny side up eggs, garlic fried rice and some chocolate oatmeal dessert. Unbelievable! With the generous portion size, it was all for I think $12. Definitely recommend and will definitely come back. Prepare to eat some heavy breakfast/brunch!Friend had the spam &amp; steak combo with the longanisa?(a sweet sausage) on the side. I had the chance to try all of them but still decided that the bangus and tocino were my favorite!What made my platter 10x better is when I mixed my sunny side up eggs with the garlic rice and added sriracha.

The fries were pretty standard but I got the Truffle Shuffle, which I was pretty impressed with. the truffle sauce was clearly there but not overpowering. the mushrooms were delicious and well balanced, and the spinach was a nice touch. The meat was cooked exactly how I ordered it and was also well flavored and didn&#39;t seem like it was a sub-desired stock.Overall I would go back for the massive beer selection and because my burger was pretty good."

I was not disappointed.This restaurant is located in the basement of Francesca&#39;s, and they do not take reservation. I came with a party of four, so I was pleasantly surprised that we found a table right away. We sat down and we were immediately greeted by our waitress. She was very knowledgeable about the wine and food menus. You get four pieces of crostini right away, served on a cutting board - they were really good!We started off with the Poppette di Melazane, which is eggplant meatballs. It was AMAZING! So good that we had to order it twice! Next, we got the Burrata Con Pomodori, which is sort of like a cheese-ball with pistachios and pesto underneath. It was a little watery, not sure if that&#39;s how it normally is, but it was our least favorite. We also got the Cozze e Sopressata, steamed mussels. They were really good, and the sauce that they came in was very flavorful. We also ordered the Pepperonata e Formaggio di Capra, which is bruschetta with a goat cheese spread. I&#39;m not a big goat cheese fan, so I did not try it, but everyone else said they loved it. We finished with an order of the Gamberetto, which is shrimp and pickled veggies. It was very tasty as well.Overall, the really cozy and intimate environment combined with the great food and wine, makes this place a must. I will definitely be going back soon!"

nana-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nana-chicago,09/21/14 , 5 ," Delicious and unique first meal on a recent Chicago trip! Came here on a Saturday for a really late brunch and just had to wait a minute or two. While we were poring over the menus, our waitress asked if we were already told that breakfast is closed, which we were not, and we were actually all making up our minds on breakfast options. Then she came back and they were nice enough to let us still order from the breakfast menu. I see now that their breakfast is until 2:30 pm, think we may have arrived a bit after that.Love that they use local organic and fresh ingredients. We shared the avocado fries, and it was my first time having this appetizer. I love avocado, but unsurprisingly I liked them in a fried version too. For my entree, I got the nanadict, and it is one of the most interesting benedicts I&#39;ve ever had. Brunch with a Latin American twist! Still tasted like a traditional benedict with the poached egg, but with a big kick of spice and flavor. I also tried my cousin&#39;s citrus cheesecake stuffed french toast. I love cheesecake and I like french toast, it was right amount of sweet for me, but I could never order that just for myself.There were occasional water (at least I hope) drops coming down on me from the ceiling.... I shifted my seat to the right and drops started coming down from there. One landed on my forehead... but by then it was too much of a hassle to ask to switch tables."
southport-and-irving-sip-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/southport-and-irving-sip-chicago,12/10/13 , 5 ," I love the thriving brunch culture in our fair city but hate the inevitable wait for a table on a weekend morning.  So it was with trepidation that I walked into this establishment at 10:45 am on a Sunday.  Much to my surprise, only three tables were occupied.We were quickly seated and offered up menus.  The selection is fairly small but there seemed to be something to accommodate various tastes.  I elected to try the prosciutto and polenta eggs benedict.  The S&amp;I take replaces the traditional English muffin with polenta cakes and is served with roasted potatoes.  I liked it and also what I sampled of the salmon blt my dining companion ordered.The restaurant offers a bottomless mimosa with brunch but I decided to go with bottomless coffee.  Refills were frequent and my cup was never less that 2/3 full. Given how generous they were with the coffee, I may have to try the bottomless mimosas on my next visit.By the time we left, more tables were occupied but there were still a few empty ones.  I&#39;ll be keeping S&amp;I as an option for when I don&#39;t feel like waiting for a brunch table.Tip: if you plan on dining there on a cold day, use the restroom facilities elsewhere before you go and avoid the arctic conditions in the S&amp;I unisex bathroom."
davanti-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/davanti-enoteca-chicago,04/12/14 , 5 ," Dined at this location twice now.  Consistency creates loyalty.For diner I had ricotta polenta with pork shoulder.  The polenta was spread out over a butcher block and then the pork shoulder was served right over top of the polenta.  The food was served hot, the seasoning was perfect.  I couldn&#39;t help but savor every bite.The server was friendly and knowledgable.  The drinks were well done.  The ambiance is warm and calming.  I can&#39;t say enough about this place.  When you&#39;re in Little Italy you should stop by."

butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,09/02/14 , 5 ," The map on yelp puts this place on the wrong side of Grand so we had some trouble (thinking we could walk and then using uber).  However, I am glad we made it here because it was a fantastic last meal in Chicago for our labor day weekend.  Eric R. selected the place knowing I do not like mixed-cuisine restaurants (I would never see Japanese and Thai belonging under the same roof normally) but he read the reviews and insisted we try it!Eric R. loves panang curry so he ordered sushi with beef panang.  His curry was so fragrant and flavorful that I was impressed with the Thai side of the place.  His has so many vegetables, basil leaves and kaffir lime leaves - so if you like curry, get it here!Carlie M., Brian M. and I ordered sushi.  I also got Japanese eggplant miso robata for $2.  That was nothing special - skip the robata.  Carlie M. also ordered a green salad which was so big and surprisingly good for what seemed basic on the menu - field greens, pears, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and sesame dressing.I ordered sushi in 2 rounds and was pleased with all of my offerings.  The prices are very reasonable per piece of nigiri and the cuts of the fish were...beyond generous.  Bigger than I have seen elsewhere, maybe ever?I got amaebi (with fried head accompaniment), hamachi (came as belly cut!), nama sake, saba, ika, tako, uni, and a summer roll.  I normally never order rolls but this had maguro, hamachi, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, and chile oil.  It was very good!  Overall, the quality was great and I was very happy with everything I ate.  I did not see handrolls on the menu though.Our server started off flustered but got better - she refilled our hot water for hot tea constantly.  When we originally arrived for our reservations, we wanted to sit outside because the restaurant was so cold.  We ended up being seated inside under 2 powerful air vents, but our server kindly adjusted the temperature in the restaurant, and the rest of the time we were comfortable.Considering our portions, we spent barely more than AYCE in Vegas per person, so this was a stellar deal!"
freestyle-food-and-drink-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/freestyle-food-and-drink-chicago-4,07/11/14 , 5 , I really love this place! I&#39;m not one for going Downtown a lot but I have actually been to Freestyle a couple of times because of its relaxed environment.Me and my boyfriend were there recently to grab a few drinks and little nibbles before we went out that night and We LOVED our bartender Michael! He was so friendly and patient while he was giving us suggestions on what to eat (my boyfriend is a picky eater lol). I&#39;m all about customer service and Freestyle gets 5 stars on that alone!The atmosphere is just cool and chill and i just love how modern everything looks in there. Next time you&#39;re around that area or staying at The Dana i would definitely hit this place up!
mannys-cafeteria-and-delicatessen-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mannys-cafeteria-and-delicatessen-chicago-3,11/02/14 , 5 , Not sure about some of the reviews here and not been to some of the places mentioned below. Been to many delis&#39; around the country and many in New York the Mecca of Deli I think. The best of them have nothing on Manny&#39;&#39;s and they are even more expensive. If price is your problem for a huge portion go ahead and try and find the same quality of corned beef in your deli and stay home.In any case I have been going there for years and the quality and comfort food is second to none. Sure there is always a place that may have a particular item that is better than here to an individuals taste. I have never had a bad meal here and I have tried nearly everything. Overall the consistency over the many years is never wavering. Was surprised to hear below that the place was dirty. In all my visits I have not sen that here. Especially considering the volume of traffic that goes through this quite large dining room. even that bathrooms are clean. It is old to be sure and a really cool throwback decor wise for the most part but not dirty. Yes parking may be an issue as high noon but they have valet service if you want.BTW- They have an outlet in Midway Airport. Not nearly as good. Especially if you have been to the Jefferson St. location. Portions much smaller and quality is inconsistent. People working at the airport location seem indifferent and snotty.Hey Manny&#39;s- You may want to take a look at that. The Midway location is doing nothing good for your brand and reputation. Tried it several time and will no more. Even for an airport there are much better options for the same price or less.

the-burger-point-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-burger-point-chicago,07/15/13 , 5 ," Is there any way I can give 3.5? No? Alright, I&#39;ll be generous and round up to 4.There are many components to a good buger, but one of the most important is the beef itself. It should have a solid flavor all on its own with minimal seasoning instead of relying on crazy toppings and sauces (*COUGH Kuma&#39;s *COUGH). The best way to assure this is to start with quality, grass-fed beef, and it looks like this place got that memo.After that&#39;s taken care of, if you want to go crazy with the sauces, toppings, and cheeses, let your freak flag fly. And this place definitely knows how to cut loose.I enjoyed a crunchy burger, which consisted of potato chips and french onion sauce on top. A unique combination of flavors made it a burger to remember for next time.The location itself is well lit and clean, with ordering stations in addition to the counter. Plenty of parking in back as well as ample street parking.Bonus points for having sweet potato fries.Still got a few more spots to hit before I declare a best burger in town, but this place is in the running."

the-monkeys-paw-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-monkeys-paw-chicago,03/30/14 , 5 ," So happy we came in for brunch! The Monkey&#39;s Paw sits in an unassuming space on the corner of a residential area of Lincoln Park. The interior is warm and inviting, seems like it would also be a great place to grab a drink in the winter. We had no problem getting a table and were even asked where we would like to sit, we sat near the &#34;library&#34; towards the back of the restaurant.To start, we went with a Bloody Mary which was very tasty! For brunch, I had the BLT&amp;E which was a huge sandwich. There was a lot of flavor going on here, including a fried green tomato and TONS of thick cut bacon. Unfortunately, I felt like the bacon was pretty undercooked and the taste of the sandwich got old about halfway through. However, huge portion, great concept, and the breakfast potatoes that came with were delicious. The boyfriend ordered, what must be, the best dish on the menu, the chicken and biscuit sandwich. So much is going on in this monstrosity of a sandwich with a huge biscuit, multiple pieces of fried chicken, pickled red onions, etc., lots of flavors.Overall, I had to deduct a star because I just didn&#39;t love what I ordered. However, the atmosphere and chicken and biscuit sandwich are enough reason for me to recommend this place! Will definitely come back for a drink and to try dinner."
cemitas-puebla-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cemitas-puebla-chicago-5,10/10/14 , 5 ," NEW COOL HIP CEMITASI still remember my first visit to the original  Cemitas location about 3 years ago. It was a long roundtrip drive but worth every minute of it. I found Cemitas because of Guy F from Triple D and thought I need to eat there. After my first visit, I was not let down. Thanks Food Network for introducing me to a Chicago original. I am a lifelong fan of this place.Fast forward to this week, when my buddy wanted to grab lunch in the neighborhood. Our dilemma was where do we eat considering we have probably eaten everywhere in our hood. I suggested Cemitas and he jumped at the opportunity.This location is much different visually then the original location but what hasn&#39;t changed is how delicious the food is. It is amazing for me to see Cemitas grow up and become hip and cool. The interior is very modern and clean. I love the large community tables. It always reminds me of eating in Europe. But don&#39;t be afraid there are small tables too if you want to eat alone. I love all of the glass which brings in a lot of natural light. The front interior can be opened on nice days. I hear there will be tables outside next summer. This modern design fits perfectly into the Fulton Market area.We ordered our food and grabbed a table. I noticed that they now serve beer which is something the old location never had. I will have to come back another day and try a cemitas with a ice cold cerveza. Hey don&#39;t judge me for not drinking at 1pm in the middle of the week.I ordered an Arabe Cemitas which is basically pork and onions but this meat is special because it is roasted on a spit-fire. As a guy, I just love meats that are cooked on a spit fire. I wish I had one of these at home. When is my local Best Buy going to start selling these? This delicious roasted pork and onions is then added to hand shredded oaxaca string cheese and served on their perfectly toasted sesame seed bread.  It is a fantastic sandwich. I also love their fresh made salsas. They offer three different ones to choose from but I love the green avocado/jalapeño salsa. It adds just the right amount of kick without over powering all the flavors. After my first bite I realize I&#39;m in trouble because this place is now within walking distance from my house. All I can say what took you so long to get here? And welcome to the neighborhood because you fit in quite nicely.My buddy got the chicken cemitas and loved it. I had no idea that this was his first one ever. I would have thrown some confetti in the air. From his reaction I know that it won&#39;t be his last. We also shared a steak quesadilla with cheese and it was really good. The steak was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.Prior to us leaving we also had a chance to talk to the owner Tony. I love how he made me feel like an old family member.  The food business should be personal where an owner should know their regular customers. It may seem old school but I think that&#39;s the best way of building a loyal customer base. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that his food is unique and really good.So if you&#39;ve never had a cemitas then maybe today is the day. It is a perfect step away from the typical sandwiches you are use to. I guarantee you will enjoy the flavor combinations as you take your first bite. I&#39;ll even come by and through confetti on you if you want."
blackbird-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackbird-chicago,08/30/14 , 5 ," My first dining experience at an establishment with a michelin star and boy it was a memorable one.This place is quite pricey.  The entrees ranged anywhere from $30-$42.  I quickly went to Yelp to do my research when I learned that the BF&#39;s parents chose this place for dinner.  I was getting nowhere with my research because a lot of the  items on the current menu 1) had not been photographed and 2) had not been reviewed.  Logical deduction: this place updates its menu often!A simplistic approach to design but a big wow off-the-charts approach to food.  I can see why you would have to book in advance for this place, AMAZING.It was a little odd seeing waiters walking around in nicely tailored suits, as though they had just walked out of a board meeting or something (reiterating, first time at a michelin star restaurant).  Unfortunately dressing nicely was not enough to bump my rating up to 5 stars.  4 stars?  It took an hour and 5 minutes for our food to arrive.  I counted.  I was hungry.Worth the wait?  Heck YES!  Why did the portions have to be sooo small?!  I was yearning for more towards the end and I kid you not, I had a DREAM about eating my meal that night!  I was in bliss, savoring EVERY SINGLE MORSEL over and over and over and over.What was ordered...1) Roasted Monkfish - don&#39;t be afraid it&#39;s my first time too ;-P I&#39;m talking about ordering monkfish.  It&#39;s amazing.  Dense yet mild.  Please order this.2) BF&#39;s mom ordered roasted halibut.  I had a taste, so good.3) The boys ordered the grilled striploin.  Perfectly cooked.All the flavors melded together so well.  I&#39;m no food expert but what puts this place over the top is me not being able to say that I have had a similar dish elsewhere.The two desert dishes ordered were peach sherbet and cinnamon concha, drool.Please come here...it&#39;s the BOMB DOT COM"

Since the food is warm and just waiting to be scooped into a bowl it took literally less than 2 minutes for our food to come out.The rice bowl also comes with 2 pita breads which are great to stuff your food into.I also added the dill and cucumber yogurt sauce, and the spicy sauce on top of my chicken, freaking delicious.Total came to $8 which was a really great price since I had enough food for dinner.  I wish they had this chain everywhere.  I really want to try their falafel and sandwich next time I go."

Mussels, Saffron broth, leeks, grilled bread $16 - It was good, but I wasn&#39;t blown away.  My favorite mussels from a different restaurant cost less for more.Nichols Farm Brussel sprouts, Pickled red onions, roasted apples, white cheddar fondue - $10 - They were good on their own, but doesn&#39;t play well with other dishes.  I actually do like the taste of Brussels sprouts so having them so strongly seasoned with other flavors isn&#39;t my thing.Butternut squash risotto, homemade bacon, baby spinach, fresh thyme, Wisconsin parmesan+add fried duck egg - $20 - I like the creativity of this dish.  It was good, but I wouldn&#39;t order it again because it&#39;s just risotto.Homemade duck egg fettuccine, Duck confit, duck skin cracklins, scallions, parmesan $17 - My favorite of the night.  The pasta was chewy, which I like, nicely seasoned and slightly greasy.Pumpkin bread pudding, Salted bourbon caramel, homemade ice cream $7 - It was good.  The bread pudding was denser that what I was expecting but the ice cream was fantastic and I wish there was more of it.Service:  Excellent!  The host greeted us and seated us promptly.  Our waiter asked if we have been to the restaurant before, explained the menu, was attentive and informative.  My water glass never went empty.Attire: Causal, jeans and t-shirt will do just fine.Parking:  There are paid parking on Grand and free parking on side streets (e.g. May).  I came on a Sunday night and parking was really easy to find."

artopolis-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/artopolis-chicago,08/24/14 , 5 ," My girl friend who lives close to Greektown strongly suggested to go to Artopolis as a group of us were craving sweets. So happy I listened to her! A group of us 4 girls came in to grab coffee and desserts around 4 p.m. on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It was packed! We couldn&#39;t find a host so we looked at the delicious treats behind the window and the girls working there were so helpful with helping us choose what we wanted to eat! The mango dessert was suggested more than the white chocolate dessert but my friend who loves white chocolate got it and loved it. There were two macarons left and we got the pistachio and vanilla one. I am picky about macaron&#39;s so if you are too- this is where to get them!Since we weren&#39;t getting them to go- we had to order by table service but we just sat down on our own with a help of a hostess. When we got our waitress she was very friendly and took time with our order. I got a hot cocoa, my friend got the Americano, and my two other friends got the frappe in which they were able to choose if they wanted it sweet, medium sweet, or no sugar. They both choose sweet. We all loved our drinks from the taste, quality, and presentation. Temperature was perfect and we enjoyed talking and mingling in a loud- chatter environment,  cultured with decorations and ambiance, with a large crowd of people. Perfect for families, large groups, or a semi casual/romantic date. I would love coming in here after a good meal or for just coffee with a macaron.I haven&#39;t tried them all, but I&#39;m voting Artopolis as my favorite coffee/dessert place as I&#39;m sure it is for many of the locals in and near Greektown.

I&#39;ve also enjoyed a chai latte or two, and most recently a soy pumpkin spice latte. I really hate how soy curdles in milk sometimes, and it did big time in that PSL. Blech. Anyways, sandwiches are tasty and the to-go salad cases are a great option on the run. With all the whole food, minimally processed options for snacks, I&#39;m a little surprised they only have Marsetti&#39;s (sp?) salad dressings. They aren&#39;t too nutritionally friendly."

angels-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/angels-chicago,06/04/14 , 5 ," Just disrespectful to be so good.I find it fascinating I never reviewed this place. Maybe it was selfishness because I don&#39;t want it to get over-crowded..as I usually don&#39;t have to wait to be seated.. maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t want them to run out of freshly prepared margaritas.. maybe because...maybe because I didn&#39;t wanna?!Anywho, this place is DELICIOUS. the Sopa de Tortilla, Shrimp Tacos, Salsa, enchiladas, salads, etc. are pretty tasty AND the portion sizes are quite generous. But be careful with starters as you may be too full by the time your food arrives.The service definitely takes this place to the next level. They were way shorthanded but everyone, regardless if you worked in the kitchen or owned the place, jumped in to help to make sure everyone was taken care of.

It was about 6pm and after deciding on pizza, we wanted the closest place possible (clearly still feeling lazy) and low and behold Compass appears.When we go in and we were immediately greeted by the hostess. Since it was relatively empty, she said we could sit anywhere. The decor seemed pretty standard for a sports bar type place, but the feeling was more chill and intimate...like most neighborhood bars. There were quite a few college football games on on their many tv&#39;s during our visit.We looked at the menu and were immediately impressed with their craft beer list (yessssss!) and were tempted with their Craft Beer Bucket special, but alas, we decided to be &#34;good&#34; and just have a drink each.Their menu of food wasn&#39;t extensive, but everything we saw sounded great, but we came here for the pizza! We ordered the Italian pizza since the description sounded like it was chock full of flavor. The pizza came out to us rather quickly, in about 10 minutes, and sure enough, it was tasty!While our visit was relatively &#34;to the point,&#34; we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  The overall atmosphere was chill, the service was great, and the facilities were clean.I can see us coming back pretty soon, especially since it&#39;s so close!"

Felt like I was blasting away the cholesterol from my Taco Bell meal earlier that day.Generous portions for the price. Seriously. These same exact dishes could easily cost twice as much.Plus the ambiance is great! Clean, kid friendly, comfortable... Could spend all day here."

bombay-wraps-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bombay-wraps-chicago-3,12/11/14 , 5 ," I love me some Bombay Wraps. A newer fast food entrant to the Streeterville area, Bombay Wraps provides wraps and plates of popular Indian street food at reasonable prices in a well lit, modern and funky dining space.Get your wrap ($3-$7) in flaky buttery paratha bread or whole wheat roti. I prefer paratha. Wrap fillings run from spicy potatoes or paneer cheese for vegetarian options, to savory lamb curry or probably the most popular, tender chicken tikka for meat options. Samosas (Indian veggie rangoons, essentially) are excellent. Haven&#39;t tried desserts. You can build your own fountain drink, buy familiar bottled favorites, or be adventurous like me and try the goofy foreign drinks. The mango juice box was sweet but had spices in it. Not good. The aloe/honey drink from Thailand, however, was a hit.An ultra-suave British/Indian looking bloke must be the proprietor of this spot. He&#39;s there a lot. Other than that, employees are cheery and helpful.A TV plays Bollywood stuff over the dining room, which is funny to watch. Look up &#34;Bollywood Boss video&#34; for a laugh.I love loyalty/rewards programs but BW may just have too many. From Spring Rewards to a loyalty punch card to AAdvantage Dining miles, methinks they&#39;re giving away too much for marketing."

mott-st-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mott-st-chicago-2,09/12/14 , 5 , So this was my second time to Mott street and my wife&#39;s third. It is brought to you by the lovely people who have brought ruxbin to the city. It is definitely different than ruxbin all around and superior in my opinion.The feel of the restaurant is more NYC Greenwich Village than Wicker Park or Chicago for that matter. It is incredibly well decorated with repurposed ceiling fans into overhead lights. They take advantage of the space that they have. The service is rather good as well.We had a 6 pm reservation and were about 10 minutes late but not a problem. We were the first seating and showed with not many people in the restaurant. Less than a half hour passes and the place is absolutely packed.The waiters helpfully guided us through the menu as it had been six months since we were last there.We shared all of our dishes as always but the dishes in general are designed to be shared to begin with.We started off with the brussel sprouts because it comes with pancetta. There was a hint of lemon in the dish which worked very well.Our second dish were the oyster mushrooms that come in a lovely miso butter sauce. We have even attempted to replicate this dish at home that just don&#39;t stand up to Mott Streets&#39;.Our third dish were the sweetbreads which had a very lovely orange glaze and were deliciously crispy.Then came my wife&#39;s favorite...the udon noodles with kimchi and cod roe. I&#39;ll say right off the bat that I am not a fan of kimchi but that this dish is downright divine. We know when a dish is great when we are batting each other&#39;s chopsticks against one another for that last piece!The last dish was the stuffed cabbage with pork butt and sticky rice. I ordered this because the waiter recommended it and deservedly so. The pork was fall off the bone tender and the rice elegantly crispy.They also had a couple beers from a tiny brewery down the street which I appreciated. I chose the Belgium IPA. The bar made a nice mock tail that my wife sure enjoyed.We will definitely be back to Mott street and I hope this place continues to do well.
ub-dogs-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ub-dogs-chicago,07/15/14 , 5 ," Simply amazing and feels your tummy with savory goodies....the Vienna dog (chicago style) is totally a different eating experience than your street got dogs, the taste of the steamed hot dogs with pickles, onions, peppers, tomatoes, relish and mustard is soooo good that it&#39;s indescribable, you gotta try it yourself and it&#39;s only $3 bucks....cheese fries with cheese whiz was so fulling but goodThe cashier was so friendly and entertaining, always smiling and greeting you like a BOSSSSS"
grange-hall-burger-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grange-hall-burger-bar-chicago,07/12/14 , 5 ," For me it was all about the sides - those beer batter onion rings go down as some of the best I&#39;ve had, and the big cut seasoned potato chunks are memorable.The batter on the onion rings was super thick and didn&#39;t flake off like a more typical onion ring that falls apart before you get it in your mouth. I don&#39;t remember what they season it with, but it left a nice almost-spicy kick in my mouth.The french fries are seasoned potato chunks as pretty as they taste. These came with the kids meals and were super filling, so I&#39;m glad my kiddos couldn&#39;t finish them all. The story with the fries is that when the server brought them out she dropped one on the ground and basically said &#39;oh well, good thing you ordered onion rings!&#39; Mind you, there are only about 4-5 potato chunks that come as a dish, so you can now understand that they aren&#39;t just a typical everyday fry... really something special.They serve grass fed burgers here. I added batter fried zucchini and white cheddar cheese to mine. It was $12 and didn&#39;t come with a side, so I was really hoping for the big wow factor. Either I&#39;m losing my love for burgers, or it was just okay. I did love that it was cooked perfectly, with an ever so slight pinkish hue on the inside. I think I would have preferred a bit more seasoning, but the quality of beef was certainly there. Not as cheesy as I would have liked.Kids meals are foolers and a great value. My kids were stuffed after a few bites! The server compared them to the size of a White Castle slider so I was worried, but the menu states for 12 and under on the menu, and a $6.00 price ticket that includes a side of the big chunky fries and a lovely little dish of cucumbers and strawberries. The combination tasted like a watermelon bite.Lovely outdoor patio with an electronic awning. They expanded it to make sure my uber sunburned kids were protected - thank you.Decor is like a modernized barn. It&#39;s super dark inside, and the bathrooms reminded me of being on my grandparents farm. Super cute and nice and clean.Wish I had room for dessert, because they are known for their pies - I spotted a cherry pie slice on the menu that I&#39;m so wishing I had room for.It&#39;s pricey here, but it&#39;s Randolph Street with a view of the Willis Tower in the distance. The ultimate urban experience."

When ordering you choose every aspect of how the burger is prepared - choose the type of meat (house blend, grassfed, etc), seasoning (multiple flavors and and levels of heat), bun, cheese, toppings, and extras (cost additional $).I met a friend here and ordered the grassfed (cooked medium), chicago seasoning, cheddar, split top, lettuce, tomato, mustard, mayo, pickle, onion. Side of  fries and a root beer.The burger was cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful. The grassfed was lean, not too greasy. I enjoyed the fries as they are fried with partial skins. Add the root beer and I was content.Small, cozy space. Fast and friendly service. I&#39;ll be back. Total was around $18 and change, but the burger was damn good!"

stax-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/stax-cafe-chicago,11/04/14 , 5 ," We weren&#39;t intending to come here, but the other place on Taylor closes on Mondays and Tuesday&#39;s during the winter season (sucks to be a Midwesterner; business operations are seasonal as well).  We, of course, didn&#39;t want to settle on Starbucks (what a fool if we did). Stax was the next breakfast/brunch we saw.  There were lots of patrons dining in; the lights were shining and bright; servers were working hard.  Yeah, this was it!  Look no further.We were warmly greeted by one of the servers, and then the hostess guided us to the table.  The menu was pretty extensive, not to mention that the daily specials were written on one of the columns which I failed to notice after we placed our order (not a big deal). I ordered the Spanish Harlem (chorizo omelet with diced veggies on the side) with mini waffles.  Hubby, on the other hand, ordered the oatmeal pancakes with bacons.The wait wasn&#39;t long at all.  I barely had a couple sips of coffee.  I took a bite of the mini waffle.  Wow, that was the best waffle I&#39;ve had for a long time.  It was so soft, fluffy...anyways, everything was so lovely about this piece of angelic waffle.  The actual Spanish Harlem entree was well-done.  Everything tasted fresh and flavorful.  Hubby said the pancakes were delicious.  The granola on top weren&#39;t overly sweet.  The bacons were cooked right; they had a nice &#34;bark&#34; to it.  Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.They were fairly busy on a Tuesday mid-morning, but the service was attentive.  All servers and the hostess were working together as a great team.  The total came to $32 after tax.  The prices were better than what you would have in the Chicago loop area, but it&#39;s literally one (1) bus ride away (CTA 157-Taylor/Streeterville) to get this place if you want to avoid some over-priced diners downtown."

the-glunz-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-glunz-tavern-chicago,02/09/14 , 5 ," I met with a coworker for dinner, drinks, and non-work conversations. Two out of three isn&#39;t bad because we ended up talking about work 80% of the time. Anyway, I&#39;ve been wanting try this place after seeing it on my way out of Plum Market. My coworker had never heard of it. It was great place for a last minute decision and for not having reservations on a Friday night. I can&#39;t say that happens all the time, but it was just our luck.We started off with the cheese platter and the french fries. My friend also got an order of the pretzel, which was bigger than the ones you get at a sporting event. In fact on our check, it even said &#34;pretzel, huge&#34;. Insert your jokes here. For my entree, I ordered the gnocchi with roast beef and egg. I&#39;ve been on this kick lately for ordering a meal with an egg - not sure what that&#39;s about. It wasn&#39;t a big portion (think small plates) but after chowing down on the fries and cheese and downing a glass of Malbec, I wasn&#39;t too disappointed in it. I enjoyed it and probably would get it again.Also, the entrance is right before the liquor store (if you&#39;re facing north) next door. I walked past it thinking it was part of the dining area and not the actual entry door. Duh."
the-3rd-coast-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-3rd-coast-chicago,11/22/14 , 5 ," I would not recommended The 3rd Coast for groups larger than 4 - we had 6 and they had a hard time accommodating us. Because they don&#39;t have many &#34;larger&#34; tables, they estimated about an hour wait on Sunday morning. It ended up being about an hour and a half til we were seated.Once we were seated, it became one of those awkward situations where you start to wonder after 15 minutes (no exaggeration) if a waitress was actually assigned to your table or not. They were clearly ridiculously busy, but it was prime brunch time - come on people, staff up! When she finally came by, she did apologize for the wait but was not friendly.As far as food/drink, I got a latte and the veggie hash. It was decent, but not stand out. Thank god I did not order a regular coffee like the rest of my group! Because they didn&#39;t have enough trays (?), the waitress stacked each saucer on top of each mug to carry it all in one trip. As in, wherever the saucer was sitting when the coffee was poured (probably the dirty counter) was then put on top of where your mouth actually drinks from the mug. Gross!"

Smaller than expected menu in the restaurant. Seems like the bar might have even more to choose from. We basically ordered one of everything.My favorite was the Uni and prawn risotto, then the braised beef, then the salad of the duck platter. Of the 3 desserts, hands down the toffee pudding was the best.I&#39;ll be back after they experiment some more for a better menu. The history of this place is so awesome - just ask the waitstaff. Can&#39;t wait till summer cause they have a giant outdoor area."

la-palma-puerto-rican-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-palma-puerto-rican-restaurant-chicago-2,05/13/14 , 5 ," Located in the heart of Humbolt Park, I must say I was a bit weary coming here to dine in but a friend assured me that this was the spot. I was worried because I am not puerto rican and i didn&#39;t know if they were going to be friendly with me. We enter and see a charming little place with a &#34;cafeteria&#34; feel. A real mom and pop type place that is serving up quality food. There are two sections of food. Fried food in one display case (Self serve) for your choosing, and the individual type of foods in the other case (they serve you). Of course I had to choose my favorite, Chicharrones fried crispy, arroz con gandules, and bistec guisado. Best choices I could have ever made! These people don&#39;t skimp on their serving sizes either. The arroz con gandules was so flavorful and  soft without having an over powering taste. It was the perfect accompaniment to the chicarrones. The Bistec guisado was a stewed beef, stewed so long that the meat was fork tender and sweet. LOVED IT! I also tried the plantain ball with meat inside and that was TO DIE FOR! It was so crispy on the outside and soft in the inside, how did you guys do it? Magic? Yeah I know it was magic.The service was good and they were very nice to me. I am glad they welcomed me in their restaurant to eat some delicious puerto rican fare."
range-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/range-chicago,04/19/14 , 5 ," This place was so good that it&#39;s brought me out of my review hiatus!We loved the restaurant as soon as we walked in. It has such a nice vibe! The interior (and exterior) design is excellent. The atmosphere is comfortable, yet romantic. This would be a good place to go on a date, have a group dinner with friends, or to take your parents to! We sat in a cute little booth for two people, which had very comfortable seats, and were greeted right away by our friendly server, Brendan.We decided to order the pork doughnuts (5) and buffalo butter cauliflower (5) from the bar food menu to start. You get 3 little round balls of deliciousness for the pork doughnuts, which are covered with a tea-pepper citrus glaze and topped with wasabi peas. They are pretty tiny though, think half of a munchkin, and the pork flavor isn&#39;t that strong, but they were still good. The buffalo butter cauliflower dish was amazing!!! You should definitely get it. It hits the spot, and manages to be crispy, even. It&#39;s hard to believe that you&#39;re eating vegetables. Yum! I also got one of their speciality lemon drop cocktails (12) which was very strong.After our appetizers, they offered us a complimentary palate cleanser of a strawberry, hibiscus, and basil sorbet. It was delicious!For our entrees, we went with one medium dish and one large. For the medium, we got the bacon flat bread (11) which comes with caramelized-pepper bacon, Wisconsin buttermilk blue cheese, olive oil, Brussels sprouts, and peanuts. This was way bigger than we expected! It comes with 8 slices, and they are perfectly crispy with generous toppings. For the large entree, we got the pulled pork (12.50) which came on a bun with Apple-fennel slaw and a side of fries. With the fries, you can use regular ketchup or spicy ketchup, of which I would recommend the latter.We finished about half of our entrees, and had to have the rest boxed up, since we still wanted dessert. We got the strawberry creme fraiche tart to share (5) which was small, but the perfect size and taste to finish our meal.Overall, I would highly recommend this restuarant. The food comes out super quickly, almost as fast as fast food! We wee surprised very time a dish was brought out, and they were always fresh, hot, and plated beautifully. Keep in mind that they have seasonal menus, and this was the winter menu. The spring menu will be out in the next week or so, and I will definitely be back to try it!"

cellar-door-provisions-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cellar-door-provisions-chicago,12/23/14 , 5 ," Cellar Door Provisions feels like it belongs in a Portlandia episode. From the menus written on long sheets of brown paper that hang on the walls to the communal tables in the middle of the shop, CDP doesn&#39;t approach its restaurant the way others do. But I like that.I wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a moment to order bread and butter here. We dined for brunch and ordered the day&#39;s quiche and Staff Meal - greens, a soft-cooked egg and, of course, bread and butter. The quiche was silky, almost like a custard pie.  But the bread and butter was the standout: two generous pieces of perfectly chewy bread are topped with a heaping scoop of butter and just a sprinkle of salt. When you dunk it in the yolky eggs, it tastes even better.Seating is limited and fills quickly. If you can&#39;t land a seat, though, at least you can still grab a perfectly flaky kouign amann, croissant or morning bun to take away. Bread, butter and pastries are the bread and butter of CDP."

Despite this, I find that I can&#39;t wait to make the 20-minute journey south again.I got a bahn mi with scrambled eggs, and a bag of chips. I don&#39;t remember the brand name of the chips, but... it was yummy.The bahn mi (official name: Sunny Side Beef) was pretty awesome. While the mix of textures in the sandwich was right--a little bit crunchy in the form of sweet potato fries with the meat and egg--I mostly remember the meat having this remarkable sweet/soy flavor. And there was a lot of it!I didn&#39;t even mind the presence of jalapenos. They were crispy and not too hot to distract from the excellent flavor of the sandwich.It&#39;s hard to take the time to savor something this good, but you should definitely try. They remind me of meat skewers my parents used to make, that have been tenderized in 7-Up. In fact, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was part of the recipe."

Patrons are welcomed to enter and seat themselves as they please. There are booths, tables, cages, and outdoor seating. Grab whatever is available! There are pinball facades and metallic light fixtures. You have just been warped back to the 1960s!It was a Monday night and Simone&#39;s was extremely understaffed. We had to wave our hands frantically for attention and our orders were finally taken after a 20-minute wait. A dinner for four was composed of Buffalo wings, black and blue salad, chopped salad, and Pilsen burger. My burger was perfectly grilled at medium rare and topped with lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, guacamole, and Chihuahua cheese. The stack was happily held together by two sturdy buns. You can forget the knife and fork as I did. The dish also came with a side of mixed hand-cut French and sweet potato fries. Definitely can&#39;t go wrong with this combo. Dinner came to a total of $36. Quite inexpensive for four.The Monday special is a can of PBR with an individual pizza of choice for $6. Sounds like a good deal to snatch. I will return and I hope the service will have excelled by then. Parking was not a huge pain. We were fortunate enough to land free parking after circling around the block once."

I love their carne asada tacos (with lettuce and tomato) and Al Pastor tacos and Atotonilco tacos (carne asada with sour cream and tomatoes). Their tortas de milanesa are pretty good too with the toasted bun and avocado. They&#39;re open at 8am and are open pretty late. As mentioned in other reviews, to order, you just walk up to the grill and let them know what you want. Oooh, do NOT leave here with out asking for a cup of carrots. Salsa is delicious too."
palace-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/palace-grill-chicago,11/10/14 , 5 ," Made my second trip to Palace Grill yesterday (a Sunday morning around 11 AM); here&#39;s my update:1) Service is only so-so, but ownership/atmosphere are incredible.  Especially if the owner comes by and chats you up (or any of the regulars, which there are dozens) or if you make the mistake of showing up in a Packers jersey for a Bears/Packers Sunday!  Definitely a very Chicago-ish place to take friends from out-of-town or if you are a sports fan.2) Prices, for the serving size, are a little high (of course, this fits the neighborhood).  In fact, that&#39;s the main difference between Palace Grill (on Madison) and White Palace Grill (on Canal)--at WPG, you can crush the place for $30 and feed 3-4 people.  At PG, $30 probably only feeds two adults, three tops, for a very negligible difference in quality.3) Skip the milkshake.  Now that I&#39;ve had it twice, you can do so much better elsewhere!4) Skip the pancakes.  I feel like Saturday/Sunday mornings at diners are when the kitchen will really shine, and my pancakes yesterday were pretty plain (had a short stack).  I like a good diner flapjack and this one was relatively forgettable.5) My vote for what you should order when you go to Palace Grill?  Anything with the hash--this is a must--then a skillet or the Denver omelette.  I tried the chorizo/peppers skillet (decent size for $11) and I would get that again; my Denver omelette during the first visit was only okay and management sent me a note after writing my first review daring me to come back just for that, so I know that item is a source of pride on the menu.  My dining partner wasn&#39;t raving about her basics (eggs, French toast, etc.) and I felt the same way so skip the normal eggs/pancakes/French toast if you come here.Only had to wait about 20 minutes yesterday morning so they turn tables over pretty fast even when it is crowded."

tavern-at-the-park-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavern-at-the-park-chicago,06/05/14 , 5 ," On a sunny weekday afternoon with colleagues, coming here for lunch was a real delight. We had a reservation upstairs on the second floor, and it was nice to see a view of the city all around us. From what I understand they have a fantastic outdoor rooftop deck, and I think that must be spectacular.This was my first time dining here, and I have to say my experience was perfect, other than I wish I would have followed my gut and ordered the short rib sandwich, because I&#39;m still thinking about how good it must be.Overall, the menu had so many options that I truly had a difficult time deciding. It&#39;s not an overwhelming menu and it&#39;s well organized, but it all looked beyond delicious to me. They have a great selection of salads, and for lunch you can choose from an entree or a list of delectable sandwiches - like the short rib.I decided to go with a meatless option today - the butternut squash ravioli dish. It&#39;s my fault for assuming, but I thought the ravioli would be made from butternut squash and stuffed with some kind of cheese. It was plain ravioli stuffed with butternut squash. Here&#39;s the thing. The ravioli were just okay. The stuffing, however, was a mix of sweet and savory. The sauce, when blended together was a tad more on the sweet side, but a nice summer dish. Not super filling.Our server was professional, friendly, gave us plenty of time to search our menus, and I appreciated that he asked if any of us have allergies, because I&#39;m allergic to soy.Great experience, and I hope to get back for that sandwich!"
asian-outpost-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-outpost-chicago,03/15/14 , 5 ," My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat in the South Loop after seeing a movie at the ICON.  We were driving down the street and spotted the Asian Outpost.  I wasn&#39;t necessarily feeling Asian cuisine, but Yelpers seemed to love it, so we headed in to try it out for ourselves.  We started off with cocktails, The Aunt Betty for me and a Diplomat for him. We both thought the drinks we just ok.  We ordered the Togarashi chips and weren&#39;t sure what to expect.  They were light and airy chips, but weren&#39;t really our favorite.My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken after consulting reviews and couldn&#39;t stop raving about it.  Apparently it is the most amazing thing on their menu.  I don&#39;t eat meat, but he couldn&#39;t stop talking about how great it was that I almost tried it!  My main course was also excellent.  I went with the garden vegetable wok seared rice with shrimp.  It was filling, super flavorful and fresh, and delicious!  Even though it seemed like it was going to be really simple, I was really impressed with the dish.We were both so full that we didn&#39;t even look at the dessert menu, but I&#39;m sure it would have been great as well.  I would definitely recommend Asian Outpost to others!"
osteria-langhe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-langhe-chicago,07/13/14 , 5 ," Osteria Langhe serves Italian cuisine that is more customary in the Piemonte region. One may say that there is a such thing as too many Italian restaurants. However, there is never a bad thing when it comes to discovering more to Italian dining than pasta and pizza.Polipo. Insalata. Seafood risotto. Soft shell crab. Panna cotta.The dish of grilled octopus, heirloom tomatoes, basil, capers, saffron oil, and grilled bread was a fantastic starter. The octopus did not have a rubbery texture to it. The tenderness of it made cutting into it feel almost like slicing through very tender chicken. Although the salad of tomatoes and mini greens came without much of a vinaigrette, there was enough to accompany the salad while letting the octopus have the stage as the star.The insalata was a salad of spicy mixed greens, kohlrabi, green peas, parmesan, and croutons of fried veal brains. The &#34;sweetbread&#34; croutons were like fried cotton candy -- if you can imagine that.The risotto comes as a different variety per day and I was fortunate that I got the seafood version that had plump scallop and shrimp. A very, very creamy base to it, the risotto is reminiscent of French cooking. This dish, however, was Italian cooking at its finest.The plate of soft shell crab and insalata russa is one that everyone should try, especially those who think that they know where the best Italian food is served. The soft shell crab had an egg batter that made it very light and there was so much meat in the crab that each bite was an explosion. The insalata russa, which is a combination of potato salad and tuna salad, an ideal choice for this dish and a great introduction to something authentically Italian that is not served in America-side Italian eateries.Nothing spectacular like a tiramisu, tartufo, biscotti, or cannoli, but creamy and outstanding for a wrap-up, the panna cotta served with mixed berries is an idyllic dessert finale. Along with that came a small glass of Amaro liqueur. Having a dessert like this prepared at the restaurant means it comes without artificial ingredients. All you get is greatness in taste.The introduction to Piemonte cuisine was absolutely luscious and a draw for what will be a constant return. The service is out of this world, from the owner who is fully engaging in conversation the way restaurant owners are in Italy to servers who can offer tempting recommendations to the bar service that mixes liquid satisfaction without any disappointment. Osteria Langhe has a &#34;Make yourself at home&#34; feel to it and regular customers will attest that another Italian restaurant on the Logan Square landscape is a dream come true."
el-maya-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-maya-chicago-2,12/10/14 , 5 ," Came here on a Tuesday night with two friends and a groupon. The place was completely empty. And it stayed that way until close. Weird. The restaurant is cute and colorful. And the waiter was super nice and gave us a liquor store suggestion because we didn&#39;t know it was BYOB and we wanted margaritas. The pitcher of virgin margarita was quite good, and even better when we added the tequila.The chips and salsa at the beginning wasn&#39;t my favorite. The salsa was cold. And there were hardly any chips in the bowl. This is one of the first times we had to ask for more chips for just the salsa.We decided to split two entrees, the chicken enchiladas and the carne asada. Luckily, the enchiladas came in three and all things on the carne asada plate came in threes as well. I think they may have done so just for our table and it was much appreciated. My steak was just ok. my enchilada was just ok. The potato on the steak plate was just ok. Overall, everything was ok. No regrets, but no desire to return either."
taqueria-el-tapatio-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-el-tapatio-chicago,05/06/13 , 5 ," I will give this place four stars for now because I can&#39;t say it&#39;s hands down the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had, but it sure is damn close! I don&#39;t even know where to begin with this review, but here goes nothing...My friend lives not too far from here and since I had been dying for some real Mexican food, she suggested El Tapatio. We came inside and the place was surprisingly empty but we had our pick of seats, so that was nice. A few people came in and out, but the puny amount of guests meant we could enjoy our meal in peace. And that&#39;s exactly what we did. The server was so nice to us. She was also attentive. We needed lots of time to decided what to eat/drink but she didn&#39;t care. She just kept coming back to check on us. They had lots of TVs playing Telenovelas and it wasn&#39;t exactly what I&#39;d call quiet, but it was fine. For a gringa like me, it&#39;s pretty funny to sit there and listen to what they&#39;re saying, trying to decipher the Spanish.We finally placed our order after having stuffed ourselves on fresh tortilla chips and spicy homemade salsa. They keep bringing them out to you pretty much once you sit down. Fairly standard at most places like this, but I thought I should make that clear you get complimentary chips and salsa with your meal. I ordered a veggie burrito dinner plate. My friend also ordered a burrito dinner and had one of the banana shakes. I went with a boring Diet Coke, but the shake was amazing. I&#39;ll definitely have that next time I come in!!! Don&#39;t make the mistake of getting the soda like I did, especially if you want the full Mexican dining experience. You can get soda anywhere, those shakes are just too yummy to pass up!The food came and the presentation was fantastic. The burrito dinners were GINORMOUS! A seriously massive burrito covered in sour cream (ours were fancy out of pastry frosting servers - see my pictures I added) served with rice, refried beans with cheese sprinkled on top and some fresh strips of lettuce, a few tomato and avocado slices. YUM! We chowed down and since my friend and I hadn&#39;t seen each other in a while, we would up staying for over 2 hours! As I said, the place wasn&#39;t busy and the waitress didn&#39;t care how long we stayed. So we gabbed away and she would periodically check on us. It couldn&#39;t have been nicer. It was like eating at home, except I could never make such yummy Mexican fare.Definitely will come back!!! Hopefully I will be able to give this place 5 stars the more places I go to."
litehouse-whole-food-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/litehouse-whole-food-grill-chicago,10/07/14 , 5 , OK So with every bad there is a good.really bad on timing when food is being prepared I literally waited 20 minutes for my order while I seen a long line of people get there food before mines.waited another 5 minutes by the counter while I seen my sweet potato fries go to someone else. If that&#39;s a recurring thing then I would suggest to write it down.Then they ran outta napkins and lemonade so that was another wait by itself but one of the guys came thru with it so the napkin incident was the least of my concern. What really bothered me was that when they asked the cook how long was until the salmon  the cook said &#34;oh I have to wait to thaw it out.&#34; Please don&#39;t ever say that especially if the place is packed that made me loose my appetite. All you had to say is we ran out.... Until its prepared just say that! OK so the flip side of things. The food was good considering the long wait. Just a tat disappointed because my wrap sat for so long it was soggy.the sweet potato fries were hot and fresh which was a plus and my wrap came it your standard waffle fries which were also hot and good.I had the salmon blazed wrap and the soy wrap as well.both were good just soggy. My cousin has the veggie wrap and the southwestern.food was good just be prepared for rushes... I mean you are by a university with hungry students.
trattoria-no-10-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-no-10-chicago,12/26/14 , 5 ," My sister and I were looking for a new spot to try pre-theater.  When you walk into this place, it&#39;s a bit confusing as you have to go downstairs and even then, I wasn&#39;t exactly sure where to go.  The decor is what you would expect from a theater location, nothing fancy but adequate.  The service was average, as was the entire experience.  Overall a solid spot to put into your pre-theater dining rotation.  Nothing blew me away but I&#39;d go back.We started with a cheese plate, which was the standout of the night.  They pair each cheese with a type of compliment and I thought these worked well together.  People rave about the ravioli and I just thought it was okay.  Kudos for the large amount of lobster in there but the pasta itself didn&#39;t taste freshly made.  I know they say it is but to me it just didn&#39;t come through.  I thought the portion sizes were perfect though.  My sister got the polenta and she enjoyed it.  I think next time I would stay away from the ravioli and try something else."
chengdu-impression-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chengdu-impression-chicago,08/06/14 , 5 ," There aren&#39;t too many Chinese options outside of Chinatown and Northside Chinatown. Chengdu Impression stands out with its authenticity and affordable prices.The 12 of us came here on Saturday with reservations. We ordered suan la fen, Sichuan wontons, dry chili chicken, boiled beef, mapo tofu with ground beef, cumin lamb, boiled fish fillet, Sichuan string beans, stir-fried pea leaves, yushiang eggplant, and a few other dishes that I lost track of. The names are a mouthful and seemingly harmless but most of the dishes are drenched in hot oil and chili peppers just the way Sichuan cuisine should be. Just fill your bowls up with lots of rice and soak up that oil. It will be an extremely spicy and flavorful meal, so be sure to have a full glass of water ready by your side.If you have a huge party, be sure to call in advance so they can rearrange a few tables for you. Also, the free garage parking doesn&#39;t begin until 5PM. So if you&#39;re going in for lunch, do street parking which wasn&#39;t too difficult."

opart-thai-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/opart-thai-house-chicago,09/28/14 , 5 ," One of the best Thai restaurants in Chicago. There are two locations: Southside (here) and Lincoln Square. My friend and I went to grab a late lunch/early dinner around 4 PM on a weekday. There were a few other parties but we were able to grab a table easily and service was prompt.My friend and I were so excited to get Thai food since we have been deprived of good Asian food in Chicago. We are from So Cal so our taste buds are a bit spoiled.Walking into this restaurant, I fell in love instantly with the decors and smell. The aroma was making me drool already and we quickly ordered red curry and pad thai.I really enjoyed the red curry. It was creamy and rich in flavor with a little kick to it. And there was a good balance of meat and bamboo.The pad thai was okay, definitely not as good as LA pad thai. I&#39;m used to more bean sprout and the noodle was a bit off for me. My friend and I finished the curry and packed the pad thai to go.Pricing is very reasonable for thai food in the city. I would definitely come back here and try more dishes that this restaurant has to offer."
table-donkey-and-stick-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/table-donkey-and-stick-chicago,07/22/14 , 5 ," I really, really wanted to love this place. I drooled over the menu for weeks before my girls&#39; night dinner plans here but sadly left feeling let down.I made every attempt to try something new and chose items that I&#39;d never had before specifically to &#34;go big or go home&#34;. I&#39;m an adventurous eater so I trusted them to choose a menu that would please.Drink -Kina Mielle = it might&#39;ve been the Vermouth that made me dislike this oneWanderteller -Duck Liver Mousse = very interesting; salty; not something to eat by the spoonful but I think it&#39;d be good on a sandwich, not sure I would get it again thoughPheasant Galantine = normal tasting sliced meatMountain Gorgonzola = good, moist, but not extraordinaryRye Baguette = good, normalEntree -Rolled Fladle = too much mushroom for me :-( the dough tasted a bit like crepes but overall there was simply too much filling and too many mushrooms on the plate (it was an overload); the lima beans and beets were good thoughOverall, I was a bit disappointed and resented spending $50 on a meal where I thought I would be in gastronomic heaven.However, the staff was wonderful and the atmosphere is excellent. I may give the food another shot, but so far, round 1 was not good."
cocos-famous-deep-fried-lobster-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cocos-famous-deep-fried-lobster-chicago,10/21/14 , 5 ," I must have told myself that I&#39;d write a review on this place later and completely forgot to. What a hidden gem in the loop. It&#39;s my guilty indulgence deep fried is right in the name. I try to justify this with the fact that it&#39;s seafood and that&#39;s healthy, right?! Anyways, the deep fried lobster is what the place is all about but if you aren&#39;t in the mood for that they do have plenty other items that are deep fried as well. I had Coco&#39;s famous fish sandwich recently, and that was awesome. I love the greens here and the cabbage. They do deep fried right because it&#39;s nice and crispy so the wings are awesome here as well if you don&#39;t want seafood. The deep fried okra is also good. You might have to get here early as they run out of sides from time to time. There was no sweet potato when I last came here. There is pretty awesome music here if you do decide to eat in. Be careful when you are opening glass bottles of pop with the opener near the register as it might spray you if shaken while taking off the top. Prices are fair but service might be slow as it takes a bit of time to fry food."
sammys-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sammys-kitchen-chicago,11/02/14 , 5 ," I do not like them, Sam-I-am.I do not like green eggs and ham.Yeah? Well Sam-I-Am ain&#39;t nevah had ham like this, or he would change his tune!!!!THE SCENEOne of the many reasons I love breakfast so much is because of being raised in Chicago. I always thought it was just our family, but it seems eating breakfast ANYTIME of day is a long standing tradition throughout the city.On a recent trip back home I discovered most of the places I grew up loving are no longer in business. Glady&#39;s Kitchenette was the benchmark of the best breakfast anywhere and it has sadly bit the dust along with other favorites like Miss Muffets on 79th and Bobby&#39;s on 90th. These were iconic spots that vividly materialize in my minds-eye everytime I think of the best breakfast places I&#39;ve ever eaten. Bobby&#39;s and Miss Muffets in particular served their breakfast with ham carved off the bone! Let me tell you a secret... You haven&#39;t eaten breakfast until you&#39;ve eaten breakfast with a giant slab of fresh cut ham!So when I heard Sammy&#39;s Kitchen was serving breakfast with fresh off the bone ham, I made it my duty to pay them a visit. Besides, they were only minutes from our hotel.THE EXPERIENCELocated in a tiny building with an even tinier parking lot on the corner of 55th and Luna Lane you will find this quaint little hole in the wall establishment. Nothing about this place is standard. The entrance door was propped open and you could see directly into the kitchen. I assumed it was a side door and walked around to the font of the building trying to find a proper entrance! NOT!!!The moment you walk in , to your right is a dark storage area with public restrooms just behind it. Directly in front of you is the kitchen counters and to the left is the dining room with a mish-mash of tables and chairs. It&#39;s a busy place, so without much standing room you tend to find people standing wherever they can, but generally blocking the entrance.This created a bit of a traffic jam for those coming in, those going out and the staff who unfortunately have to keep the refrigerated drinks and silverware outside of the kitchen near the congestion. You will hear  &#34;excuse me, I just need to get in there&#34; often as you wait to be seated. It took us 20 minutes to be seated, but honestly it flew by as I spent most of that time in conversation with my Chicago brethren waiting with me to be seated.THE FOODSammy is the definition of the term &#34;service with a smile.&#34; They truly go out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. They initially got my order wrong, but never sent it out because the manager/owner caught the mistake. They promptly told me of the error, but assured me they were working hard to get the order out quickly, and they did!- HAM &amp; EGGS (3.75 stars) | $6.50It wasn&#39;t the exact flavor explosion I was looking to experience, but it did the trick. I enjoyed the ham more than the eggs.- FRENCH TOAST (3.5 stars) | $3.95- VEGETARIAN OMELETTE SPECIAL (4 stars) | $4.50My wife loved it! Included onions, pepper, mushrooms, cheese, hashbrowns and toast.- CORNED BEEF HASH (1 star) | $I did not enjoy this at all. Cooked too hard and had very little flavor.- Pancakes (3.75 stars) | included as a substitution- Hash browns (3 stars) | includedThis is old school Chicago style hash browns. Good, but would be awesome if they were seasoned.Featured on the TV show &#34;Off the Bone&#34;:youtube.com/watch?v=yZ6J…FINAL THOUGHTSThe portions are enormous, especially the ham slice, which could have fed my family all winter! I believe it is right at one pound of grilled porky deliciousness. We all enjoyed our meal and none of us could finish our plates because of the sheer amount of food. If I had any complaints it would be they added waaaaay to many onions to my eggs and I wish the hash browns were seasoned. Other than that we found the meal to be very enjoyable and super easy on the wallet.Service: 5 starsReasonable Prices: 5 starsFood: 3.5 starsI DO like them Sam-I-Am, I really do like their glorious ham!"
frontier-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frontier-chicago-2,09/13/14 , 5 ," I have mixed feelings about this place but accept that it is not all bad. After all, it is the official Saints game host for the 2014 season and Chef Jupiter is a native New Orleanian.My first and best experience was a AYCE crawfish boil over the summer. A group of us dined on the outdoor patio and enjoyed the Four Stars Brass Band. The crawfish were a nice size and seasoned well.My second visit was mediocre. I went with a group to watch our first regular season game which happened to be the Saints/Atlanta in Atlanta. Four Stars blessed us with a nice second line tune after every touchdown and during every commercial break. There were very few seating options. The empty seats were dead smack in the sun. Our group pretty much took up the entire restaurant. Regular patrons were told to come back after the game. Makes sense because it literally took two servers and 50 minutes to actually get a drink. After another hour passed, I went to the bar to order Red Beans and Rice and a Shrimp Po Boy for a out of town guest. We never received the po boy but we were repeatedly told, it would be just a few more minutes. The beans and rice were as good as any you would get in NOLA or Belize. Seriously A1 stuff.As a Saints fan with few viewing options, I will definitely return. But, frankly I am inclined to bring in a bottle of water and eat before I get there. Before going to the extreme, I&#39;ll give it another try. Hopefully the crowd will be smaller which should result in better service."

My friends have raved about Tufano&#39;s since well, can&#39;t even recall. But for a long time. So needless to say, I was excited to finally make it to this &#34;diners, drive-in, and dives&#34;, local go-to.It&#39;s definitely a Cheers place where truly the regulars are practically family, including my friends. We started with the Tufano&#39;s salad which was yummy - what wasn&#39;t in this meal of salads. Then, on to calamari. And then my meatball. Well, I tried to get the shells and broccoli but that didn&#39;t work out this time. The meatball was filling enough after the rest we had.With its chalkboard menu hangin in the main dining room, basic italian staples, and overall family atmo, I can see how T&#39;s can become anyone&#39;s regular. I will just have to go back for second and thirds according to my friends, who admit that my experience at T&#39;s was atypical. The shells/broccoli is apparently to die for and lemon chicken is the male fav.So, I look forward to going back. Larry B, famous Celtic, stopped by T&#39;s a few weeks ago so says the owner so... think you gotta check out what the hubub is about here at T&#39;s."
taqueria-sabor-y-sazon-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-sabor-y-sazon-chicago,09/21/14 , 5 ," I finally have a favorite, vegan-friendly taco place in Pilsen! They don&#39;t use lard! They use vegetable oil with their refried beans. Some of the other popular places in Pilsen (*cough* Nuevo Leon *cough*) even use lard with their tortilla chips.So far, I have only had their veggie tacos, rice and beans to go. When you order, be sure to say &#34;no cheese.&#34; Even though the menu says that cheese is extra, they automatically put it on the beans and tacos. They replaced my tacos for no charge when I brought them back. The woman at the register even said, &#34;Oh, nothing from animals, right? No cheese or sour cream.&#34; I said, &#34;Right, vegan. Nothing from animals.&#34;Apparently other vegans have been there before!The veggie tacos have beans, Mexican rice, shredded iceberg lettuce, minced onions, cilantro, fresh avocado and a slice of tomato in corn tortillas. The refried beans are thick! You can see bits of bean in them. Hooray for protein! Basic tacos, but satisfying and cheap, which is what I expect from a taqueria. My friend and I also got a small bag of crunchy, lightly salted tortilla chips and spicy red salsa for free. The taco dinner is $7 (three tacos, rice and beans). Individual tacos are a little under $2 each.My friend got the pastor, carne asada and fish tacos, and approved of all three.Note that I forgot to ask if the rice has any sort of chicken broth in it (sometimes Mexican and Spanish rice do), but when I was looking around for lard, I didn&#39;t see any sort of chicken broth on the shelves behind the counter.Also, personally, I have a &#34;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#34; policy with veggies being cooked on the same grill as meat. If I see it is, I don&#39;t eat it, but otherwise don&#39;t ask. Because the veggies are raw, no worry about veggie and meat cross-contamination. I don&#39;t know about the tortillas, though. The staff seem very accommodating there, however.If you&#39;re a vegan in Pilsen and looking for dinner with meat-eater friends, urge them to walk off the beaten Nuevo Leon path to Taqueria Sabor Y Sazon."
tortoise-supper-club-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tortoise-supper-club-chicago-2,06/25/14 , 5 ," I really enjoyed this place.The Tortoise Club is right in River North. It&#39;s in a spot that does not really stand out. You walk down a couple of steps from the sidewalk to get into Tortoise Club.The day was beautiful and we sat outside. The menu does not have an enormous selection, but it was adequate. They are one of the places in Chicago that offers $1 Oysters - but only until 6:30, and we arrived at 7 so we missed the cutoff. We did order shrimp and two types of oysters to try. All were outstanding - very fresh.For dinner, I had a petit filet with pomme fritte (french fries). The meat was excellent - perfectly aged, perfectly rare. The reduction was outstanding and made the meat taste even better. Others with me all got different things off the menu and each shared the same compliments.We skipped dessert in favor of going out elsewhere afterwards. I would definitely recommend the Tortoise Club to anyone looking for a great meal."
viaggio-ristorante-and-lounge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/viaggio-ristorante-and-lounge-chicago,04/30/13 , 5 ," Just really really good itallian. Honestly everyone talks about La Scorola-- I think this place is MUCH better.We started with the zucchini frites, eggplant stack and meatball salad. The frites were fine. I wouldnt order them again. I would get the eggplant stack and meatlball salad again 10x over and over again. They were incred.I got the veal scallopini. Such a big portion and delicious! Tried lots of different pastas too -- all were excellent!"
uptons-breakroom-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uptons-breakroom-chicago,07/13/14 , 5 ," My favorite seitan products has a sandwich shop. What can go wrong? NOTHING.CLEAN SHOP, friendly staff, ice cream, Stumptown cold brew and a completely vegan menu. Not much seating inside but there&#39;s an outdoor area decorated with moss roses. Seriously, why isn&#39;t this place in Des Moines! Not fair!!! Upton&#39;s Breakroom does everything right. Very impressed."
ara-on-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ara-on-chicago-2,03/21/14 , 5 ," This place must be relatively new since it wasn&#39;t there 3 years ago when Hubby and I held our wedding reception at the Rookery around the corner (and all our families were staying at the W and the JW Marriott across the street).  It was pretty empty for a Friday night.  Despite this, the service was super slow!  We had to flag the waitress to place our orders, change the dishes on the table since they were dirty, and get our check.  The person refilling our water glasses was the most attentive person to our table.The sashimi platter wasn&#39;t impressive.  The pieces were cut really thick - 3/4 inch thick salmon anyone?  We also ordered the Ara On Chef Special roll which okay.  The food was overpriced and definitely not worth it.  This place likely caters to tourists and business people and not locals."
chef-luciano-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-luciano-chicago,08/06/14 , 5 ," I thought there would be a few more cajun/creole options coming to this place based on Yelp, but it is more like a fusion of all of different cuisines with an emphasis on Italian I would say. But at lunch, you get one of the largest portions ever for about $8-9 so that is a steal since I didn&#39;t even need dinner that night after my trip here ha haBut big portions are not what wins me over, and the pesto chicken pasta was a great buy price wise since the lunch deal includes a drink and garlic bread too, but was it the best pesto in the world? Of course not. But was it pretty good? Yes, yes it was. Matt J. got their fish special and upgraded to quinoa for $1 more which is also a good deal. There was a sign in here explaining what quinoa was which I appreciated being an avid quinoa eater myself ha ha And again it was a large portion, came with veggies and such, so was a nice healthy lunch choice that was filling and affordable. But again not overly flavorful, but good nonetheless. So if you are in the area and need a quick lunch, this is a great option! And I guess Chef Luciano makes his own lemonade too since he sells them by the case here!"
real-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/real-kitchen-chicago,06/11/14 , 5 ," For my 300th review, I will go all wedding crazy and recommend you to try Real Kitchen for catering or for a stop-in meal.Of the whole wedding process, I found catering to be the only nightmare. I researched dozens of non-traditional routes like tacos stands, bbq buffets, and personal chefs. I also tried a couple big companies who quoted me $24,000 NOT including alcohol, which I thought was super hilarious. For some unknown reason, caterers were the most unprofessional, slow, and weird people I dealt with in the wedding process. I also am not a fan of the &#34;it&#39;s-your-big-day&#34; scam and those annoying people who want to spend 45 minutes on the phone with you to &#34;figure out your style&#34; and then have multiple meetings and blah blah blah.Nick from Real Kitchen was wayyyy more &#34;my style.&#34; He was low key, responsive but not obnoxious, and totally sold us when we tasted his tamales. My husband&#39;s (that&#39;s my first time typing that word!!) family is Mexican and they are great cooks, and they also raved about the tamales.I have very limited time and Nick did not make me spend wasteful time on the phone. We went in for a tasting of latin food, a menu which he created. We talked, we laughed, and we hired him. That was it.We also had a walkthru at the venue before the wedding which was really helpful in making the day more real. But other than that, he was not needy and he just did &#34;his thing.&#34; I love people like that.I also decided to have him to do the cupcakes, which I trusted would be awesome. And the guests won&#39;t shut up about the cupcakes. They were snatched so fast you&#39;d think they had drugs in them. I&#39;ve seen so many cupcakes sitting at weddings untouched...not these!!I will make sure to stop in for dinner at Real Kitchen when I can. Their team is so cool and nice. Have you seen their video spoof of Alinea? It&#39;s hysterical."
nando-milano-trattoria-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nando-milano-trattoria-chicago,07/28/14 , 5 ," We came here for a bachelorette dinner of 6 before our night out and I scoured the reviews beforehand...In summary, it is rather expensive, the waiter was definitely pushy and the dishes are not the size you&#39;re expecting for that price.All that being said, everything I ate was delicious and I would definitely return again with family. Everything genuinely tasted homemade and reminded me of my time living in Rome. My mother&#39;s side is Sicilian, so I can also appreciate that both the head waiter and chef were from Sicily, complete with thick accents and longer hair. It&#39;s hard to find an Italian restaurant you can trust is authentic, these days.They were very excited for our celebration and entertained us the entire evening with light banter and drinks. They even comped two rounds of limoncello shots for us!I ordered: Maltagliati San Marco, Arancini di riso, and Calamari.All in all, it was worth it. I would definitely recommend!"
ameer-kabob-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ameer-kabob-chicago,09/30/14 , 5 ," Food fuels my motivation when I work out and seeing as this place is at the end of my running route it&#39;s often been the reason I&#39;ve burned a bunch of calories. Even though I end up putting them back in eating here it&#39;s all relatively healthy stuff and definitely doesn&#39;t break the bank.The entrees are all about 10 bucks and come with a good sized side salad, creamy hummus, rice and pita bread. With pretty quality portions of tasty marinated meats It&#39;s definitely a steal for something that you can potentially eat for two meals.There&#39;s not much to the interior or the signage, but don&#39;t let that fool ya...it&#39;s a pretty solid spot for pickup or delivery. Overall a great spot for folks the who dine on their own more often than not."
blaze-fast-fired-pizza-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blaze-fast-fired-pizza-chicago-3,12/26/14 , 5 ," This is where pizza meets Chipotle.  Well actually Subway started the &#39;build your own&#39; meal craze (but Chipotle receives all the credit).Blaze uses this same approach for building your own pizza.  With the exception of the crust, every other ingredient is selected by the customer.  From the sauce to the seasoning the choice is yours. They have all fresh ingredients and with the &#39;build your own&#39; pizza you select as many (or few) as you want.  They do have some standard pizzas available but why would you come here for that?The staff is super friendly and helpful. On my first visit I appreciated them asking if it was my first time and then guiding me to the process.  The person who helped me was extremely patient as I went down the line deciding what I wanted.  After building your pizza, they put it blazing fire oven and 180 seconds later your name is called to pick up your pizza.Both times I&#39;ve been here I ate my pizza in their dining area (which has a cool and casual feel to it) which allowed me having my pizza almost immediately after it came out of the oven. The flavor was amazing; extremely fresh.  Unfortunately on both visits I did not have any leftovers so I cannot comment on how it is when warmed up the next day.If Blaze is in your area and you have not checked them out; shame on you.  Get moving.   And if you happen to visit a city that has a Blaze (as I did), be sure to check them out.  You will not regret it.As it says on the &#39;Blaze&#39; website:  &#34;Enjoy the rest of your day.&#34;"
ceres-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ceres-cafe-chicago,12/10/14 , 5 ," Get crunk as funk on the cheap in the loop? Yes, it exists!You must order liquor here. Why? Every liquor drink comes in a full glass of liquor and a soda can (not pop!) on the side. This has made the perfect celebratory setting when friends have gotten new jobs, promotions or other random life events. You got a new haircut? Let&#39;s go to Ceres!Funny story: my then bf and I got whiskey wasted one fri night here and when I came home drunk-craving cupcakes, he busted out Molly&#39;s cupcakes and an engagement ring! The rest is history.The crowd has changed a bit over the years as now it&#39;s much younger and less dudes in suits, at least on Fridays. Also, the food is only good to keep you drinking. Overly-salty and greasy, but you don&#39;t come here for fine dining.Thanks Ceres for giving my boo the liquid courage he needed that one night and being the setting for tons of great memories!"

The salads and sandwiches are wonderful, so are the yummy crostini appetizers.  You can tell everything here is very fresh and farm to table as their name says.  The interior is shabby farm chic with very pretty light fixtures and country music playing, which is awesome!!Can&#39;t wait to come back, wish I lived closer!"
phils-pizza-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/phils-pizza-chicago,11/21/13 , 5 ," I eat pizza on the North side, all of the time.  The other day a South sider asked me where I like to go on the South side for Za&#39;.  I mentioned a name only because I knew the folklore of it but other then that I was clueless.  When in the area, I might hit up usual chains like Connie&#39;s but I decided then I needed  a more wider range of pizza culture.  So, this was my first south side stop, of many to come.Phil&#39;s is a no frills type of joint.  Not the typical family style restaurant with a waiter.  There&#39;s a counter to order at, there are tables and chairs and then there is a restroom.  You order your pie, you order a couple sodas and then sit and wait.  Now, say you entered with a group of four or more and wanted drinks all around; you wonder could you purchase a 2 liter?  They have them sitting in plain sight.  This is a not an option.  2 Liter sodas are only available for delivery.  All diners in, must purchase an individual soda.  Yeah, I didn&#39;t quite get it either but then again, they don&#39;t offer much in the arena of condiments and flatware.  They don&#39;t have cups either but they do have plenty of seating and free parking up and down the street.  Booze is not sold but if you want to indulge, you&#39;ll have to bring all components in order to enjoy.It&#39;s food fast done correctly.  Chicago style thin crust pizza is what is being ordered often.  The door is always swinging open despite it being dead inside, this is about any time.  The kitchen is filled with people constantly preparing and loading pizzas into their ovens.  During the cold season which is when my visit occurred, the only heat in the place was that which was emanating from the kitchen, so dress appropriately.  The lady working the counter had as much nicety as an employee working the booths at any CTA train stop.  Although the latter may be sweeter.  However, she was nicer with those that seemed to be repeat customers or locals.Their menu is bare.  It&#39;s thin crust, choosing from a small selection of sandwiches or pastas and that&#39;s it but it works for them.  I&#39;ve loaded a few photos of a large two topping I shared.  The pie had those large pieces of sausage commonly found in deep dish pies, it was overwhelming for me since meat was in every single slice but that&#39;s more of a personal difference than negative.  Sausage, garlic and a dusting of crushed red pepper.  Taste and texture were good.  Served piping hot right out of the oven.P.s. what is the deal with pizza places around here that don&#39;t take credit card???"
rosals-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rosals-chicago-3,10/13/14 , 5 ," Eating at RoSal&#39;s reminds me of Sunday dinner at my nonna&#39;s when I was a kid.  The atmosphere is homey with an old-country decor, and they make me feel welcome.  (Only no one pushes me to clean my plate.)Hadn&#39;t been here for at least a year when we visited last week, so wasn&#39;t sure what to expect.  Glad to report it hasn&#39;t changed much.  I ordered the shells with fresh broccoli and shrimp, sautéed with just the right amount of garlic.  Delicious.   My friend had the 1/2 chicken RoSal&#39;s, perfectly seasoned... but his vesuvio potatoes were overcooked.  Our salads were nothing special.  But the scooped-out pineapple filled with homemade sorbet and the tiramisu were both awesome.The waitress was very attentive.  She didn&#39;t hurry us, even though it was busy.  Refilled out coffee several times without asking.   The food here is good, but I think it&#39;s the service that sets this restaurant apart from most of the others on Taylor."
bub-city-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bub-city-chicago,12/13/14 , 5 , Where is the smoked turkey?  They took it off the menu.  Lowering a star because of that.Don&#39;t come for an 8pm reso because they shove you in the bar area with w/ a bunch of drunk chads and trixies who are all smashed up on your table while trying to eat.  Ughhh that&#39;s annoying!  Another lowered star.Fried pickles are good though.
shokolad-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shokolad-chicago,08/30/13 , 5 ," I had the Varenyky, veggie dumplings in sauce at their food stall at Daley Plaza, it was delicious! will go and visit the restaurant to taste their extensive menu."
la-cantina-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-cantina-grill-chicago,11/18/14 , 5 ," As a native Californian, I was hoping this place would be a little better overall, and not so hit or miss on the menu.....especially as a fellow South Loop area neighbor!First, I will say the service is great--everyone is so nice and friendly and warm. And if you want to catch a game here, they have a few flatscreens around and when we went on a Sunday everyone was watching the current NFL game, so it is nice to be able to eat out in a nicer dining atmosphere while still watching a game for sure!The sangria was a little too fruity though for my tastes, but this place is super affordable with four of us getting dinner and drinks with tax and tip for $100. Pretty darn good if you ask me. I got their pork tamales which were a little dry, but their beans were really tasty and their rice was fine too. The enchilada bite I got from a friend was better than than the tamales too, and so was Matt J&#39;s Mexican steak that was actually cooked really well and the sauce had lots of flavor--Matt also practically licked his plate clean too ha haSo like I said, the menu is hit or miss, so three stars for me, but I would definitely go back since it is so affordable for a sit down meal in a friendly environment."

It was late-ish and I&#39;d been making merry...repeatedly...which left me craving some tasty Mexican fare. My friends were kind enough to humor me and agreed to try a new joint out; this rarely ever happens so needless to say, I was on a serious high from not getting outvoted as we made our way into the mean streets of Chicago with one seriously crabby designated driver.Even though we snuck in JUST before closing time, we received fresh chips, amazzzzing salsa (the Verde is yum) and were served up killer fare with not only a smile, but a side of freshly-grilled jalapeños. Their Ribeye Burrito and Al Pastor were outstanding! The people here are a sheer delight...customers as well as the staff.I have since returned, sober, *ahem* and my meal was equally stellar. Craziness!Although this delightful slice of  the Barrio is a tad far from me to enjoy regular visits, Taco el Jalisciense, my waistline wholeheartedly thanks you for the distance between us.  Muchas Gracias!"
the-boarding-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boarding-house-chicago,09/26/14 , 5 ," I really enjoyed my dinner at The Boarding House. The multi-level restaurant was adorned with impressive statement chandeliers that were made of wine bottles and wine glasses. The decorations, in addition to the dim lighting created a fantastic ambiance for a nice dinner.After taking the elevator up to the second floor, we were seated in the middle of the dining room. Our waitress offered excellent recommendations for appetizers and drinks as we looked over the menu. We started with the ahi tuna crudo, the braised octopus, calamari, beets and goat cheese. For my entree, I chose the venison with polenta. The venison was cooked to my liking and it was tender, juicy, and absolutely delicious. The bacon and currants really enhanced the flavor.I decided to go with something a little different for dessert - the blueberry goat cheese bread pudding. Admittedly, I was skeptical about that combination but the plump, fresh blueberries baked into a skillet cake with chunks of goat cheese was surprisingly amazing! The goat cheese cut the sweetness of the cake and added to the creaminess of the dessert. It tasted like an incredible blueberry muffin.At the end of our meal, they brought out chocolate cookies that were a nice gesture but they paled in comparison to the tastiness of the actual meal.Four stars all around for the atmosphere, food, portion size, and the service."

This is one of the few places in the loop that makes decent Pho, even though it&#39;s a Korean grill place. The pho is tasty but instead of a mint veggie plate, which is the norm, it comes with a cilantro veggie plate. The chopsticks are small and wooded and is too flimsy for the pho noodles. I find it funny that there is a $.50 Extra charge for takeout unless you bring your own bowl.  The other half of the menu is Korean, and it looks tasty but the allure of Pho wins each time I&#39;m here. One day I&#39;ll take the dive into the Korean side."
pierogi-heaven-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pierogi-heaven-chicago-3,10/05/13 , 5 ," Simple and delicious are the two words I&#39;d use to describe Pierogi Heaven. The menu is minimal, but they have a wide selection of pierogis. You can order different flavors by threes. The spinach, meat and spinach, potato, potato and cheese were all great. The fruit mix was fun to try, but probably wouldn&#39;t get again. It was a little tart. The red borscht was alright. The meat dumplings in it were good, but kind of thick skinned.Two things I didn&#39;t like about this place: no restroom for customers and use of styrofoamThis is their second location. Last time I checked, it is way less crowded than their first location, but people will find out about this one soon enough."

You know that smell?? thats it! These are not your ordinary hash browns, this place specializes in hash browns, how cool.We came here on a Sunday. It was around 1030 but by 11.... Line out the DOOR! Everyone was excited to try this place.The decor is awesome, very late 50s perhaps? Or the 20s? Oh jeez I have no idea. It looks like boardwalk empire haha. They have got a sweet record player kicking some good tunes and friendly staff.// Bubble and squeak - ~8$ - It&#39;s got pork shoulder, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes and some hash! I opted for the extra dollar for bacon fat hash.. Don&#39;t even know what it is but I was sold. I imagine its cooked in bacon fat and more likely to kill you faster. The Brussels sprouts were a bit underdone to my likely.. A bit too bitter but some people like them that way. That&#39;s my only complaint. Would not order again because I think I would like the other hashes betterWould I come back? Yeah! Definitely. I&#39;m looking forward to trying the corned beef hash. And 2 $ coffee with free refills. Amazingggggg"
bari-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bari-chicago,11/25/14 , 5 ," Damn good sandwiches. I came on Halloween - I remember exactly because this year the weather was horrible, LSD was getting flooded, and traffic in the city was atrocious from like 2pm to 8pm. What would have been a 35min round trip sandwich run took almost 4 hours. I could have walked that faster.I kept asking my friend if the 2 spicy Italians we got were worth such a pilgrimage... But I&#39;ve gone farther for seemingly less. Even wrapped, they smelled amazing in the car and I devoured a 12inch in minutes when we finally got back.A sandwich worth the 3 hours in traffic for sure. The meat is just so quality (and in good quantity) and everything on it is so on point. They are giant sandwiches. I think a smaller 9in would have been plenty and a wiser decision for my belly in the long run. But whatever. Worth it. And that alone is 5-star quality in my book - and I don&#39;t say this easily.Aside from sandwiches there are aisles of interesting packaged food products to browse through, and a deli counter full of pretty good and sometimes hard to find stuff. Def worth checking out!Limites parking around back available, apparently?"
mity-nice-chicago-14,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mity-nice-chicago-14,01/31/14 , 5 ," NAUGHTY OR NICE?That was written on there back wall when dined here. I&#39;m gonna go nice in this review with a hint of naughty at the end. Since they set the theme with there printed messages.We were attending the Rudolph show at the Broadway Playhouse and decided to grab lunch before the show. I tried making an online reservation for 11:30am but the computer would only allow me to make one at Noon. We made it for noon but we were still seated at 11:30 when the doors opened.  There was a long line waiting to get in.Our waiter was also very nice. He was laid back and just went along with the flow. He also understood the menu. We ordered two craft beers on tap a Municipal IPA and a Fascist Pig. When the food runner brought our drinks over she said, &#34;Whose the Fascist Pig?&#34; I had to chuckle out load and the food runner laughed too. She said, &#34;I love saying that!&#34; It is great to see a food runner have fun at there job. It is a great personality like this that makes restaurants successful.Our waiter also dropped off some pop overs which were complimentary. He described them as the same ones you get at a Brazilian Steakhouse. This got me excited because those are so good but don&#39;t get to excited because the ones here are not that great. Hey there complimentary and free for a reason.We also ordered a kids meal for the little one. The Chicken fingers with hand cut fries was $6. The chicken was really good. As parents I hate when you taste your kids meal and you wish you had ordered that. The fries were also good too. You can&#39;t go wrong with fresh hand cut fries.We couldn&#39;t decide on what to eat so we decided to order a few apps and share them. We got the Deep fried calamari and the Roasted chicken nachos with salsa verde. Both were really good. The calamari was served in a cute deep fry basket. The portion was really small when compared to other restaurants for that price. It definitely could be a side dish and not something shared. The dipping sauce was the star of this dish. The chicken nachos were very good. They serve a lot of rotisserie chicken here so you will notice it in much of the menu. I&#39;m sure there is not a lot of waste by doing this. The chicken was very tasty and moist. I also thought the salsa verde was a nice change to most places serving a red salsa.Here is a naughty thing that happen. The bartender started messing with the TV while the Bears game was on. We were sitting in a booth in the bar and enjoying the game. Next thing I know the channel starts changing and were watching bowling. What? Bowling? I was going to get up and say something but figured there was probably some high tipping regular at the bar who gets their way.  Eventually the Bears game reappeared on the TV screen. I asked our waiter what happen and he said someone at the bar wanted to watch the Indy game. Honestly this is Chicago. You don&#39;t change a TV in Chicago to watch the Indy game. You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m being nice because I should be naughty and give you 1 star for that move. I hope management has a talk with bartenders about hometown teams and it&#39;s never acceptable to turn off the bears game unless Ditka is on another channel.The other naughty thing is when we picked up our tickets after lunch there was a note in there telling us about us getting a % off of our dinning bill at Mity Nice for attending the Rudolph show. What? Again I want to be naughty but I&#39;ll be nice. We mentioned we were going to the show to the hostess and waiter but neither one mentioned the % off. So that kind of sucked. Typically staff is trained in the promotions going on and will alert customers of those promotions. So I&#39;m gonna assume the staff didn&#39;t even know about this because believing that will help me sleep at night. I will be honest it did not feel good to think we payed full price when we could have got a % off.See I said I would be nice but I could have been naughty. That Rudolph show put me in too good of a holiday spirit to even be naughty with my Yelp stars. I will advise you to pick up your tickets first because you never know you might be missing out on a promotion here or in the water tower place. LEY owns the food court down here and offers many options for lunch or dinner. Mity Nice is the sit down option if your looking for table service. They also have some nice happy hour specials during the week."
noodles-in-the-pot-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/noodles-in-the-pot-chicago,09/19/14 , 5 ," Chicago -- of all the wonderful things you have, Thai food is not your strong suit, but yet there&#39;s so much of it to offer.I took a Pad See Ew to-go -- almost $11 -- and rushed home on the Blue Line so I could eat it in the comfort of my home. I dumped everything out of the white paper bag and thought there must be some hidden compartment, some magic trick to the bag, because certainly there was more than this small container of noodles.&#34;Alright. That&#39;s cool. Stay positive. 600+ reviews. Stay positive.&#34;I didn&#39;t stay positive for long. I consider Noodles in the Pot to be riddled with what I call Yelper&#39;s Bias. Yelper&#39;s Bias is a fascinating idea. It&#39;s when a place gets lots of good reviews due to a combination of factors, such as being in the right location (thus getting the most Yelper traffic), not having terrible food (removes the risk of getting 1-2 stars), and/or being reviewed by innocent Yelpers who just might not know any better (Midwest folk reviewing Asian food).Well, I&#39;m here to spit the truth, Chicago. There&#39;s gotta be better Thai food than Noodles in the Pot, there must be. In my month of moving up here from Houston, I&#39;ve been to 3-4 Thai places. None of them have been above average, and I&#39;d say Noodles in the Pot is below it. I&#39;ll let you know when I find good Thai in Chicago."
jubranos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jubranos-chicago,12/31/13 , 5 ," Great middle eastern food in this place! Though the gyro cheeseburger did look delicious, I opted for the grilled chicken sandwich. It was packed with moist chicken flavored with lemon herbs. There were fresh tomato and greens inside and a tasty tahini sauce on the side that I just poured into the pita. Wished they had dropped a few packets of hot sauce in the bag though.The prices here are a bit steep but it looks like they have great daily specials: 6 bucks for a different sandwich, soda, and fries. Solid place for college students to get some grub."
carbon-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/carbon-chicago-3,11/12/14 , 5 ," After overindulging at industry night at our local spot, my friend and I needed some decent food, but couldn&#39;t think of any of our favorite spots that would be open at 11:00 pm on Sunday. Found Carbon on GrubHub and SOOOOO glad we did!!We got horchata, chips and guacamole, small steak quesadilla, and steak burrito bowl. The horchata was a little too sweet for my taste, but my friend (who is half Mexican) said it was legit, so I guess his vote wins.I&#39;m a guacamole snob and Carbon&#39;s is good. Not great, just good. As another reviewer said, our meal didn&#39;t come with any limes and it certainly could have used a splash.The food was delicious. My only complaint was the bowl for the burrito bowl was made of flour, not corn, so it was a little sweet and more chewy than crispy. Not a fan.I will definitely be ordering from here again!"
tapas-valencia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tapas-valencia-chicago,07/07/14 , 5 ," Except for one occasion I have only been to Tapas Valencia on dates. It is such a good date spot...not saying don&#39;t go with your friend...but fellas if your looking for a cute, affordable (during happy hour), and trendy spot to take your date I recommend this place. I went here on a blind date and after the embarrassment of approaching the wrong person, I was ready to have a cocktail and settle in. :)Definitely check happy hour times before you go. During happy hour a tapas that&#39;s normally $8 could be $3 The food and cocktails are really  good! I had the championes, bravas potatoes, and the bacon dates. All delicious! The guy I was with just had a beer, but he seem to enjoy it. LolThe servers are really friendly and the atmosphere is very inviting. Another plus is they have patio seating outside (love the outdoors!). I don&#39;t frequent this place nearly as much as I should, but I do plan on coming back again."
yolk-river-north-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yolk-river-north-chicago-2,12/30/14 , 5 ," I have an unhealthy obsession with Yolk&#39;s Tour de France - it&#39;s the first thing I ever ordered there and it&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve ever ordered to this day (it routinely wins the unspoken &#39;who ordered the best thing&#39; contest). I came down to Chicago to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday and was happy to find the next morning that I was within walking distance of two Yolk locations. I opted for the River North option and had a surprisingly speedy experience considering it was prime Sunday brunch hours.Since I was solo, I was able to get a seat at the bar and was greeted and able to place my order within a minute of being seated. It took maybe five minutes for my food to be delivered, and my server had my drink refilled and my check ready to go just as I was finishing.As for the food, my Tour de France was as perfect as ever. The tour consists of banana bread with sliced bananas and peanut butter, lemon poppyseed bread with blueberries and orange sauce, and orange bread with sliced strawberries. Each slice was incredibly moist and flavorful, and perfectly portioned from mini loaves. The strawberries were a little bland, but since it&#39;s late December in the Midwest I had no expectations of them being at their peak.The Red Velvet french toast always sounds amazing, but the Tour de France is a guaranteed knock-out; next time I&#39;ll have to bring a friend who will let me talk them into ordering the former so I can give it a try."
alegrias-seafood-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/alegrias-seafood-chicago-chicago,05/17/14 , 5 ," Buckle up for some of the most delicious, massive portioned Mexican seafood in town.  From the moment you enter this crowded BYO &#34;people&#39;s seafood&#34; joint and see everyone frantically devouring huge plates of lobster, mountains of shrimp, heaping portions of crab legs, etc., you can&#39;t help but roll up your sleeves and say...bring it on! And bring it they did. Wow!As we were sitting down and before our butts even reached our chair, Ceviche Tostada&#39;s, a plate of limes and basket of tostada&#39;s and some &#34;...dang that&#39;s hot&#34; but soo delicious Habenero hot sauce were laid out in front of us.  I know people come here to consume as much seafood as they can consume but I just have to point out that the Guacamole is outstanding.  FRESH, explosively flavorful, and tasting like it was prepared with the love of grandma making it for her family coming over for a Sunday afternoon meal. I can&#39;t remember eating better.Then came the food.  I ordered the Pena Rellena, a house specialty where someone takes a pineapple, delicately slices it in half the long way, scoops it out...then pours a &#34;shovel sized&#34; portion of shrimp, crab, octopus, scallop, onion, pepper and pineapple into it, slaters it with queso fresco and bakes it in the oven.  Served on a plate with fries, salad and moist delicious flavored rice.My accomplice ordered a bowl of the 7 seafood soup.  What they didn&#39;t mention was that it was a SALAD BOWL size!As much as we wanted to do the flan and tres leche dessert, we just ran out of room.Outstanding, friendly service and reasonably priced.  Charming cozy space."

It is sooo insanely delicious.The only issue I had was that I could eat it until I threw up. Something about the food turns off the sensor in my brain that tells me I&#39;m full and I just have to eat, and eat, and eat myself into a food coma... and pray to have a burrito baby.PS- the place isn&#39;t pretty but boy, is it good."

ada-street-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ada-street-chicago,11/23/14 , 5 ," If I could give more stars, I would.  Ada Street knocked it out of the park from start to finish. Although it was our first time in, Ada Street has been our best restaurant experience in Chicago.  It is a bold statement but they earned it.Since it was our anniversary dinner, we took the 6:30 reservation.  I am glad we did because it got very crowded. (You can call ahead to get on a wait list).  The restaurant is unassuming on the outside in the middle of nowhere by the Home Depot on North Ave.  The location is part of its charm. Once you get inside, you are in a narrow brick hallway but it opens to an intimate restaurant in the back.The food is exceptional. I would literally eat the menu but alas my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  We had the pork empanadas, the steak tartare, the special  hand-rolled pasta with mushroom ragu, farro salad, octopus and wagyu hanger steak. Everything is phenomenal. All of the dishes are well conceptualized and executed perfectly. The seasoning is spot on and the dishes are well-balanced.  The special hand-rolled pasta and the hanger steak are out of this world.  We also ended with the panna cotta which had a nice, smooth creamy texture with a nice crunch from the streusel.  (Now that I write this, I find myself craving more).Aside from excellent food and beverages, they have excellent service with an attention to detail without any pretentiousness.  Everyone wished us a happy anniversary and made a great experience starting off with a glass of champagne.   Our server, McKenzie, was friendly and very helpful with cocktail, wine and food recommendations.  We loved sitting at the Chef&#39;s table and seeing behind the scenes.  Chef Zoe is very talented and very personable. She also creates an environment where the staff like being there and you too just want to hang out.I really cannot say enough good things about the food and people at Ada Street.   Ada Street has won over our stomachs and hearts."

I ordered the meat combo platter twice and chicken was quite juicy and tender.  The kifta kebab was tasty too. The 2nd time it was all a bit dry.

They have a fridge case with raw meals, desserts, and salads (made daily) and a selection of fresh raw juices. The juices come in cute glass milk jugs and there is a $1 refund when you bring the bottle back. There is also a shelf with SunWarrior protein and raw snacks.I went with an acai bowl topped with strawberries, bananas, and their raw granola. Delicious!I also grabbed a green juice and the raw &#34;egg&#34; salad. The green juice is pretty earthy and not very sweet, which I enjoyed, but may not be for everyone. I was a little disappointed with the egg salad. It was okay, but I probably wouldn&#39;t buy it again.I cannot wait to go back and try some other dishes. There were samples of a raw hazelnut pesto that was delish!Meal plans too....tempting!"
handlebar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/handlebar-chicago,11/18/14 , 5 ," I feel a little embarrassed to admit the sheer number of times I&#39;ve eaten their food, but I need to spread the good word. I left the vegan sahara desert that is Lincoln Park for vegetarian friendly Wicker/Humboldt neighborhood and couldn&#39;t be happier.I live a block from Handlebar and have dined in or taken out no less than 5 times in the past week and a half (3 meals in 3 days is my current record). I just can&#39;t help myself...I love this place for it&#39;s creative vegan/vegetarian fare. My go-to has always been the pepita pesto w/blackened tofu for brunch (DO IT) and the sambal tofu for dinner (ALWAYS WITH FRIED PICKLES) so a few times forced myself to branch out and of course was not disappointed.The diablos vegan w/blackened tofu are ridiculous...they come on homemade tostones, covered in chipotle sauce w/black beans, avocado &amp; chorizo seitan. I&#39;m not a big fake meat girl so would skip this in future, but otherwise this thing was where it&#39;s at. If you want a variation of this for dinner, order the black bean tostadas w/blackened tofu.Also noteworthy and amazing is any special they have, their soups, chili, &#39;chicken&#39; wrap and probably everything else on the menu. Which, I will conquer. Tonight is their special vegan burger &amp; it&#39;s got my name written all over it.Also, super friendly, great enclosed patio in back &amp; it&#39;s usually nice and warm in there. Things that are important to me. Easy street parking. No-brainer. Get there."

We also had a couple of the pizzas, the special of the day as well as the fig one and both were delicious!in addition, we had a chance to taste several of the starters from the heirloom tomato salad to the Octopus which were both good, as well as one of the pasta dishes which was the rigatoni with lamb ragu . .also quite tasty.We went with the 46oz ribeye for the table (it&#39;s listed as market price and on the night we were there is was $115 so not for the faint of wallet)This was a beautiful piece of meat full of the marbeling that makes a ribeye so tasty and they sliced it in the kitchen for us to share (it says it&#39;s for two but trust me- there is meat a plenty for 4!)Given the large portion sizes of all the food we had, we ended up taking a lot of this home for leftovers but it was good nonetheless!Loved that Billy Lawless, himself, was there talking to people at the tables (one in our group had actually seen him the night before at another one of his venues so it&#39;s clear he likes to see his customers up front and in person).  He asked us what we thought and was even nice enough to buy us a round of drinks which was very unexpected but quite appreciated!If you drive- know that you can park across the street in the Grant Park parking garage (underneath the park) or around the corner at the University Club Valet ($25)All in all a great place to enjoy a casual dinner with some great food and amazing service!"
carnitas-uruapan-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/carnitas-uruapan-restaurant-chicago,02/23/14 , 5 ," KNOW YOUR PIGI have been looking at this place on line for a few weeks. They are really social savvy and that is what caught my eye. I noticed on Facebook that they post a weekly secret word on Wednesdays. All you need to do is mention the word and you get 2 tacos for the price of 1. I then went to there website where I learned that they only serve carnitas. I thought to myself if they make one kind of taco, then it must be amazing. Time to read reviews on Yelp and with a 4.5 star rating I knew it was time to bookmark and visit this gem.As soon as I walked in, the waitress approached me speaking Spanish and I attempted to use the secret word...&#34;La Serena&#34;. I think my high school Spanish paid off because she smiled and spoke to the owner who was walking out the door.The owner Marco was nice enough to stop and talk to me. I love meeting owners because you can see there passion for there business. I pointed out to Marco how socially savvy his business was and informed him that is how I got to his front door. It is good for them to know that the social posts work on creating awareness and getting new customers. Marco then informed me that I could also get a free order of Chicharrón, if I checked in on FourSquare or Yelp. I showed him my app already checked in and said, &#34;I know and thank you!&#34; I love check-in gifts.I asked Marco to help me order. What I learned is that you must know your pork when eating here. There is a chart on there menu, at the tables and I posted it as a tip. You can pick where you want your carnitas meat to come from for your taco. At first I thought that is so cool and then I panicked. I wasn&#39;t a butcher! What do I choose? Where do I start? I thought all pig was created equal?Marco was a huge help and he ordered 4 tacos for me in Spanish. He suggested for my first time I get Pork Shoulder and Pork Rib. So I decided to get two of each. While I was talking to Marco his cook, who was slicing the carnitas to make my 4 tacos, offered me a sample of the meat. I thought that was really nice. I had already ordered but he wanted me to have a sample still. I think he was proud of his pig. The process of roasting the pig is two hours until it transforms into succulent pieces of pork.Marco suggested I get the shoulder and rib because those were the safest choices for my first visit and because they are mostly meat. He said as I get more adventurous I can start adding more fatty pieces of the pork like belly. So you really need to know your pig. Don&#39;t look at this and be afraid. Look at this as a culinary challenge to make the most delicious carnitas ever.I was carrying out my food and got my 4 carnitas and a bag of fresh Chicharrón all for $5 and some change. Thanks to the secret word and checking in. Social Media Rocks! The bag was very heavy. They do not mess around here with there meat.When I got home my wife remarked at how delicious the smell was. I had to prep her on the know your pork, before we dived in. I explained which tacos were which, before our eating adventure began.I must say we enjoyed them. We loved the pork rib carnitas because they were the juiciest. You must be careful with this one because the bones and cartilage are still on there. I quickly pulled the bones out and saved them for my home made stock. Score! The carnitas came with a nice big container of green salsa that was very delicious. I wish I could make the salsa they make here. It worked so well with the carnitas. Yes I&#39;m having salsa envy.There was so much food we couldn&#39;t finish it all. I think one taco might be enough for one person, in fact I was stuffed. I was just happy that I had a meal of carnitas waiting for me the next day.  These leftovers are worth it. You definitely get your monies worth when eating here.I also enjoyed my Chicharrón. This was the first time I ever had real Chicharrón and not out of a processed bag. It was yummy and I&#39;ve been nibbling on it all week. For those of you who have never had it, it is deep fried pig skin and it is so delicious. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not healthy because something that tastes that good can&#39;t be healthy.Thanks to Marco and his friendly staff for making me feel welcome on my first visit. I can not wait to return. The menu also expands on the weekend (Sat &amp; Sun) with more available dishes. I&#39;m now thinking that those items must be really special and I&#39;m sure this place is packed on the weekends. This is also a family business. Marco&#39;s Dad started this place in 1975 and 39 years later they are still pumping out quality food. Congrats to Marco for keeping the family tradition alive and to another 40 years of carnitas love in Chicago.So know your Pork, pick your meat &amp; get ready for the best carnitas that Chicago has to offer. Enjoy because I know I did."

White Borscht and Beef Barley are two of my favorites.The cheese crepes are also delicious. The crepe skin light, thin, but not too thin, crisp and just perfect. Never had anything here that wasn&#39;t fresh, homemade and tasty. Check out some photos before your go so you understand the place and it&#39;s food."
francescas-on-taylor-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/francescas-on-taylor-chicago-2,06/21/14 , 5 , My party of 3 secured a reservation through open table.When we arrived 4 minutes early we were greeted by the manager.  He was so friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we were dining at his establishment.  We were then seated immediately and once again thanked for choosing Francesca&#39;s.The lighting was low and there candles on the table.  The decor was a classic wood with a modern/contemporary underscore.  The music was indie/alt rock at a very reasonable volume.  The ambiance was overall very nice.Our server was friendly as could be although he was a little slow at times.  This would be the only negative part of our experience.I ordered the tortellini al funghetto.  The dish contained mushroom stuffed tortellini in a aromatic white wine cream sauce covered in mushrooms and garnished with Parmigiano Reggiano.  The meal had a beautiful smokey and woodsie flavor.  It was really unexpected but very well done.I will definitely be back sometime and I will suggest Francesca&#39;s to my friends on the hunt for some yummy Italian or vegetarian meals!
blackwood-bbq-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago,12/05/14 , 5 , Can I give the corn bread 5 stars? I like it that much. it had real sweet corn in it!this was the 2nd time my office ordered lunch from here and I have never been at the store so I can&#39;t speak for service or ambiance. The food is just okay. I suppose this can cure your bbq fix and you can try out the different sauces (Memphis was good). The brisket was kind of dry and lacked flavor both times...I kept chewing on it and I got bored eating it. I liked the pulled pork more. They have a nice crust on the mac and cheese too.

Pancakes, eggs, meat, are good but the rest of the menu is a little bland. Biscuit for example is very floury and bland...no amount of butter, gravy, or even syrup can help this. Their &#34;spicy&#34; sausage gravy is also very bland with no sign of spice or sausage. Cheddar grits were also very bland...could not taste the cheddar here at all.Come here for an old fashioned breakfast but stick to that. Their southern offerings aren&#39;t worth the try."

My colleagues kept saying we should have lunch there one day so I figure I would eat there very soon. Then half year later, I was sitting here thinking how much I missed.I ate the whole plate of Chicken Roti Rice plate for lunch which I didn&#39;t know how was it even possible. I had rice, couscous, hummus, tomato and cucumber, eggplant, and chicken chunks on a big plate. Pita and hummus were decent. The stir fried Eggplant was soft, smooth and a bit on a salty side which makes it delicious when eating with pita or rice. The best part is Chicken was truly juicy with a nice flavor. They cooked it just right and didn&#39;t over-season the meat.The line for lunch was long. They do have a nice seating area outside. But there was construction on the road side so people chose to sit inside instead.  It was very crowded and noisy to the level it was difficult to carry a conversation.. I need to learn how to order online to take it to-go. Want to get Falafel next time!"

I wish I knew about this restaurant earlier, but the flavors are off the wall. Not spicy, just full of zest and the food is very fresh. The chicken is juicy and not over cooked and goes well with the fresh pita bread that they make. The mixture can be enjoyed as is or placed into your pita. The sauce the goes with it has some heat, but is simply delicious.

Although almost deserted of patrons when I went for dinner, I had a wonderful experience in terms of food quality and taste, and enjoyed a relaxing meal.The food is fantastic. Despite noone else eating at the time we were there, the food was fresh and hot. Baba ganoush was soo silky, smoky, and smooth. I cleaned that up with the hot and buttery bread. There&#39;s nothing like the smell of hot fresh bread to start a meal on a cold winter night. The entrees were great too, although my lamb meat wrapped in &#34;thin bread&#34; looked a lot like enchiladas. Still good though. And the service was personal and great!"

I did have this type of &#34;grown up&#34; root beer float that was delectable.Okay so on with the not so great stuff.  It&#39;s a type of dive bar, but only in the way of cleanliness.  I get the decor &amp; loved it.. I mean who doesn&#39;t like a skeleton head at the bar to drink with,  right? But seriously owners. . Clean the bar, the menus &amp; the bathroom. .

scofflaw-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/scofflaw-chicago,08/04/14 , 5 ," I was excited to try this place out....but it fell short. I was not impressed at all. I went on a Saturday afternoon and my first thought was to sit outside since it was such a beautiful day. I changed my mind after seeing how small and claustrophobic the patio area was. So we went inside and yet again I thought this place is tiny, but the friendly door guy told us there was seating around the corner.At first I was sort of like this is cute, but then as we sat there we realized it wasn&#39;t really cute, but just different. Not necessarily in a good way. I just can&#39;t help but to compare it to other places I&#39;ve been to and although it was different it didn&#39;t really do anything for me. The couches weren&#39;t that comfortable and the service was rather slow. We really wanted a Pina Colada and I enjoyed mine, but my friend was excepting it to be a little bit creamier. My other friend wasn&#39;t that impressed with her drink either (can&#39;t remember which one she got).The most disappointing part was the burger. It had no flavor at all. I actually didn&#39;t even finish it cause it wasn&#39;t worth the calories. The best part of our entire visit was the fries. I thought they were delicious! I probably won&#39;t be coming back here, but Logan Square is such an up and coming neighborhood and I can&#39;t wait to venture and try other places."
el-habanero-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-habanero-chicago,09/10/14 , 5 ," This is my favorite Mexican joint that I have been to so far in Chicago.The owner here is super friendly, and his wife and family are all really friendly and welcoming, I love coming here because I always feel so at home.I have tried a large variety of items on the menu and each one is flavored so well, and they all taste delicious. I have tried the pambazo/antojito, gordita, tacos, burritos, chilaquiles, tres leches, horchata ( made in house and they add a chocolate bar to the pot for good measure) My favorite so far has got to be the pambazo.The pambazo is a toasted sandwich doused in a red guajillo pepper sauce and filled with chorizo.  The bread itself was so soft and crunch on the outside, and the guajillo pepper sauce made the sandwich addicting.  I could have eaten the entire sandwich myself but I stopped because I still wanted to try the other food.The carne asada here has the best flavor out of any carne asada I have ever tried, I didn&#39;t even have to add that much spicy sauce because the burrito itself already had so much flavor. The gorditas here are super filling for only $4, and I could be full of a single one.  They are stuffed with meat, cheese, and a light frijoles on one gordita.The chilaquiles here come on a huge plate, and they have the perfect amount of burn and spice.  You must order the horchata here, it is so creamy and doesn&#39;t taste like any other horchata I have had, perhaps because it is made in house and not mass produced."

Everything about the experience is near perfection, from the extremely professional yet friendly service to the plating of the food, which turns each dish into an individual work of art, combining delicate and varied flavors in surprising and visually appealing ways.The dining room is sophisticated, understated, and calm, a serenity that extends even into the visible kitchen, yet the contemporary soundtrack keeps the experience upbeat and fun.My only quibble is with the winelist, which has a strong focus on wines from the Loire region, not my favorite.  This focus extends to the wine pairings served with the meal, some of which didn&#39;t seem a great match, although the friendly and articulate sommelier explained the reasoning behind each match in such a captivating manner I was glad we had selected the pairing, even if next time I will strike out on my own."

It isn&#39;t a huge place so it could get crowded very quickly. There&#39;s a very nice selection of wines and cheeses and each cheese has it&#39;s own accompanying garnish from dulce de leche to tomato relish. So tasty. I&#39;ve also discovered a new grape- grillo from Sicily- which is a great summer sipping wine. Other than cheese the only other thing I&#39;ve off their food menu is the pizza nuts which I wasn&#39;t a big fan of but my friend seemed to like. The service here is very good. The bar inside is absolutely gorgeous, the finish is really amazing. Very chic. If you sit outside the tables are a bit of a tight squeeze and they are at a slant.Definitely a winner in my book!"
wings-around-the-world-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wings-around-the-world-chicago,01/21/11 , 5 ," I counted 9 countries and 43 wing flavorings offered here.  I picked up 20 fried wings for $12.99.  10 were American lemon pepper, and 10 were Jamaican mango jerk.  The mango jerk tasted pretty close to the lemon pepper, but with a sweet and not very mango flavored adder.  Both servings were nonetheless tasty and satisfying.  The wings and drumsticks were also good sized and plump.  I&#39;ll probably go with 30 wings for $15.99 next time, and there will indeed be a next time!The store is quite spartan, with just a couple of worn bench seats.  Your order your wings, and it takes about 15 minutes if no one is ahead of you.  Just a note - the internet menu may say they have grilled wings, but they only do fried I was told.A good stop, and a lot of choices.  There was easy and close street parking out front on 75th street.  They&#39;re also open til 5am (apparently a night club is next door), so any wings craving you may have can be satisfied almost anytime!"
yan-bang-cai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yan-bang-cai-chicago,11/28/14 , 5 ," This restaurant was alright for me. The decor is unique, service pretty decent, food came out fast and hot, and prices are a little on the high side for Chinatown (closer to suburban pricing). The flavors are pretty good, but doesn&#39;t seem too distinguished from other similar restaurants - for one that boasts several pages on their menu about regional specialties. With that said, they do have a wide variety of spicy dishes that come in a good portion size with nice presentation. But really nothing stands out that would really pull me away from one of Tony&#39;s restaurants.Here are some of my notes on specific dishes:Song&#39;s Three-Bean and fish soup: Nice light soup with pea shoots and seasoned with just the right amount of white pepper. The fish is tender and lightly flavored. A bit pricey for a soup that doesn&#39;t contain more complexity and body.Quick-fried Seven-step duck: Probably the most skillfully prepared dish I tried. With the multiple cooking steps, in the end it tastes something like a mix between twice cooked pork and smoked duck with tender meat witht he flavors of onion and jalapeno coming through strongly. However, chopping it into pieces rather than slicing in a way to minimize the inconvience of bones while eating really took away from a great dish.Spicy cumin lamb: The lamb and its marination are flavorful and tender - salty with a light aroma. The cumin here is definitely noticable but not robust like preparations you find elsewhere although the flavor of the garlic was nice and strong. Not too spicy and good for a nice meal in the winter.Zigong Salt Miners Spicy Pork: The pork has a bouncy texture and the pepper flavor is noticable, however this dish really could&#39;ve had stronger and more distinctive flavors.Crispy eggplant in fragrant sauce: The batter for the eggplant was definitely crispy, however it was fried fluffy like what you find in a Chinese Buffet rather than using a nice thin tempura-like batter. The eggplant flavor itself was barely noticable although the sweet vinegar sauce tasted great with the batter.Squirrel-shaped fish w. two flavors: Comes in two flavors. The orange sauce is tongue-numbing spicy but really has little depth to it. The brown sauce is a sweet vinegar. Both pieces of fish looked great with a real flower next to it, but it did not come out crispy at all.Pork belly with mustard greens: Pork belly come out very tender with a great amount of fat on it. But this dish tastes exactly the same as any other preparation in Chinatown for the same dish. I would&#39;ve preferred maybe to see a slightly different type of pork used or a regional flair to it.Glutinous rice balls w. sesame stuffing: Strong egg flavor balanced with a light wine. A little on the sweeter side but not excessively so. Light hint of ginger and good body to the soup. The sesame filled rice balls are soft and provide just the right amount of chewiness. This one was the best executed dish of the ones I tried.In summary, the food here is pretty good however I put it at 3 instead of 4 stars because of its prices for the quality, lack of uniqueness, and inconsistent execution accross dishes."

They were incredibly fresh when I ordered... around 7pm on a Monday. Their chicken shwarma bowl is where it&#39;s at. Get everything, especially the garlic sauce and mix it all together.The downside: I looked at their nutrition facts! YEESH. Seriously so much sodium goes into that bowl. You&#39;d think a salad bowl is healthy but it actually has a lot of calories when you mix everything in there!BUT THE FALAFEL!!!! WOW! 50 cents each and sooo tasty!

Also, the tacos come with beans and rice in the taco, sliced cabbage slaw on top, and a side of fresh tomato salsa. I was really impressed with the steak and pork in verde sauce tacos, although everything else was super tasty and flavorful. The horchata was just ok.There are a million other items I&#39;d love to try at El Milagro so I will definitely be back/bring friends!"

I went for the lunch but after hearing about the breakfast buffet I can&#39;t wait to go back!!!I have gone to other Soul Food Restaurants and leave thinking I could have just stayed home and cooked myself but this place although I could have stayed home and cooked myself; I was glad I didn&#39;t because they were the real deal.  The sweet potatoes, the chicken, the collard greens and the Mac n&#39; Cheese.  I swear I can taste it now, but I digress!  They also have a little salad bar and plenty more meats like turkey meatloaf, pork, turkey, and of a host of other veggies!Their buffet is a little different then other places; you do not touch the plates or the food!! You tell them what you want and they serve you!  I have to say at first I was like umm I think I know how to get my own food but when the waiter explained it was for health and safety reasons for the customers it did make me conjure up thoughts and times of people not washing their hands, sneezing, etc. at the traditional buffets that made a lot of sense.You can go up as many times as you like but make sure when you are feeling stuffed don&#39;t head back up if you don&#39;t think you will finish your plate because they do have in writing that they can charge you for wasted food and/or have an extra charge if you want to bring your leftover homes.The buffet also includes all you can drink but it is only one dessert per each buffet ordered!!!The prices of the buffet varies depending on if you go for breakfast, lunch, a weekday or weekend!!!  When I find out the correct amounts I will update my review!They also have a regular menu but the buffet is the best value!"

We also all got smoothies/bubble tea.For the 4 of us and allll thatbomb.comfood it came out to $16.25/pp. I feel that was  great price especially bc we had a ton of leftovers too.

grand-palace-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-palace-chicago,08/21/14 , 5 ," One star for the irony of an ugly duckling like this place being named the &#34;Grand Palace.&#34;  This family friendly neighborhood joint is the perfect place to come to after watching pretty much any Chinese movie.  In every Chinese movie I&#39;ve seen, there have been multiple scenes of families sharing big meals, and if you&#39;re prone to suggestion like me, then you need to know about a place like this after watching a movie like that.  It&#39;s very Chinese here, the customers are all Han, all regulars, it&#39;s a vicarious thrill for a sociologist or cultural anthropologist and others so inclined.  I had the shrimp noodle soup which was pretty good, I wanted to join the family next to me because they ordered a nice combination and were obviously enjoying themselves.  The Han language menu is considerably longer than the English version, if I came here with more people I would have just said, &#34;we&#39;ll have what they&#39;re having.&#34;  Being a little outside of Chinatown there are some distinct advantages, easy on off from the Dan Ryan, they have their own little inadequate parking lot in front, lower prices, no tourists.  I came in here because of an enticing positive Yelp review, the proximity to the expressway on/off ramp, I was on my own and in between destinations, so it worked for me to be alone.  However, it&#39;s an authentic Chinese family joint, so it would be much more fun with more people, and it&#39;s very kid friendly.  There were lots of children, extended families, a nice but not quiet atmosphere.  The staff is closer to elderly than middle age, one waitress-owner-manager-cashier, one busser, two cooks, it&#39;s not a speedy combination but service was adequate, friendly, and they knew just enough English to get me what I wanted.  That was the only English I heard the whole time I was in there, which was perfect.  A big screen television aired some Taiwanese soap opera, as a sociologist I&#39;m amazed that considering all the other differences in cultures, how similar soap operas are in Spanish, Korean, Chinese, and American English.  I guess we all like to see rich beautiful people with melodramatic problems and evil twins."

The burrito was more tortilla than ingredients, so it was a bit on the bland side. I ordered the matcha latte which was okay, I would try something different next time I go there for the waffle.Service: The service was good in the sense that they were nice,  but the order in which the food was delivered kind of put a damper on my experience: the breakfast burrito came first, then a few minutes later our drinks, then about 5 minutes later my waffle.  I thought the order in serving was the beverages first, then the food to the table at the same time or one after the other so that people can eat together not stare at each other eat."

For the record, waitress said it would be on top of the benedict. There was no sauce on the spinach and eggs didn&#39;t ooze over so it was dry and hard to incorporate.Ordered a size of chicken apple sausage because the dish didn&#39;t come with potatoes or vegetables (besides the awkward spinach), and paid $3.50 for 2 thin and tiny sausages, which are not even made in house so that&#39;s pretty pathetic (see photo). I will say that they were incredibly delicious, the apple (or honey?) came through strongly.Rojo Bloody Mary is good but doesn&#39;t taste that uniqueKale smoothie is fantastic."

We had wanted to check it out and went on Sunday night with no real wait and it was maybe half full.We started with the pretzel, which is the second best I&#39;ve had but better than the ones at Prost. I really liked the wheat butter and blackberry jam. Yum!I had the Oktoberfest pork shank with apples, sauerkraut, and some root veggies. This isn&#39;t your parents&#39; Oktoberfest meal, it&#39;s definitely gone through the hipster wash here. It was good, but I wasn&#39;t crazy about the skin on the pork shank. No big deal. Bf got the pork roulade which he really liked. I got the weinerstephaner hefe which was really good.Service wasn&#39;t the best. Our server definitely seemed bothered that we had questions but there were some things that we couldn&#39;t tell what they were on the menu. In addition, I wanted to get a beer that I was likely to enjoy so I had a few questions. We just seemed like a bother for him. On the other hand, the woman who brought over our drinks was more than happy to answer whatever we wanted to know.As others have mentioned the atmosphere here is fun: brews, brats and bikes. I would come back with a group to sit at a long table and pass around a boot and eat some pretzels. There is some pretty stiff competition on the block, I would prefer to go to Revolution before here next time I&#39;m in the hood."

(That&#39;s me.)Step 2. Put a tiny fireman&#39;s hat on said fool&#39;s head. (Giant head, tiny hat!)Step 3.

lao-sze-chuan-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-sze-chuan-chicago-2,07/19/14 , 5 ," This sichuan style restaurant is aimed towards American customers.I came in on a Friday night, and they were very busy, but we were still able to be seated right away.They gave us a red chili oil cabbage appetizer ( which was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night asides from the dessert).We ordered shui dzu niu rou ( spicy beef and cabbage ), la dzi dza dzi ( the famous chili deep fried chicken ) gai lan xia ( broccoli shrimp the only non spicy dish), sichuan style fried thinly sliced potato with chili, and the sichuan style sesame tong yuan.The dishes are all at least $4 more than I have paid at other places, and when you take out all the chilis there was barely any meat left.  Speaking about the meat, the shui dzu niu rou was not spicy at all, and compared the the chili deep fried chicken, it was tasteless.The &#39;famous&#39; chili deep fried chicken was the saltiest deep fried chicken I have ever had in my life. I had to have 3 mouthfuls of rice for every bite of chicken because it was so freaking salty.  It wasn&#39;t even spicy AT ALL. The broccoli chicken was fresh and edible, but so overpriced at $15.The sichuan style fried sliced potato didn&#39;t have the vinegar flavor that I was looking for, I could have made this dish so much better myself.The sesame tong yuan with the rice wine, was a good finisher, except they gave such a tiny bowl for $6.I honestly don&#39;t think I would ever come here again because the food wasn&#39;t spicy at all, it was overpriced, and way too salty.  I usually don&#39;t eat that much rice, but I had to eat 3 bowls of rice here because of all the salt."
johnnies-snack-shop-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/johnnies-snack-shop-chicago-2,03/09/14 , 5 ," It wasn&#39;t bad... No. I take that back. It was pretty bad.My friend asked me if I would ever return to Johnny&#39;s Snack Shop and my answer was ready and on the table: NO.I explained: there are plenty of better cheap restaurants close to where I live and there is no reason for me to make a trek to Johnny&#39;s Snack Shop. If I lived on the same block and needed a quick, cheap meal then sure thing. I&#39;d go back; however, that reality doesn&#39;t exist for me.Our only reason for going to Johnny&#39;s Snack Shop was that my friend didn&#39;t want to wait an hour for The Little Goat around the corner. IMHO, we should have waited that freakin&#39; hour.My Tuna Caesar Salad cost $7.50, but I would have rather paid $15 for something that I couldn&#39;t have made myself. All of my homemade breakfasts out-shined Johnny&#39;s Snack Shop.Sure. We got a table right away. But there were folks sitting a few tables over who (obviously) were dressed in clubbing clothes (defined as glittery, slinky tops, leather mini-skirts, and thigh-highs) and smeared make-up on their youthful faces who had partied the night through and were going strong into the morning. Next to them were two or three tables of cops. It was a very different scene from the yuppies at my destination of choice.This is what we ordered: my aforementioned salad, cinnamon raisin French Toast, and some sort of skillet. I think that ALL of this food was perceived and appreciated as bodily sustenance to quiet ravenous hunger and not as a pleasant edible experience.I mean, my salad was made with iceberg lettuce and had ice-cream scoops of tuna salad on top. The two or three tomato wedges tasted funny. I can&#39;t really comment on the skillet except that I easily skipped over it on the menu and then felt validated when I saw it. The French Toast was made with cinnamon raisin bread that you get from Jewel: thin and small. It did not come with anything except for a few triangles of French Toast on a plate. Even my non-foodie companions commented that a visual once-over deemed those triangles lacking.Service was alright. It was quick and polite but rustic. Like, there was no charm or nuance that is found in surrounding restaurants. They brought us our check and we sat for one or two conversation topics waiting for them to take our money only to realize that we needed to pay at the counter. Nobody told us about that.My friends live over an hour-drive away from here. I wish they could have conquered their need for instant gratification so that they could enjoy an even more satisfying meal. Our only purpose for going to Johnny&#39;s Snack Shop was for a quick fix and it was just that. So two stars for not having a wait and serving us edible (but not delicious) food."
taza-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taza-cafe-chicago,11/22/14 , 5 ," Easily the best falafel I&#39;ve had in the Loop, and the freshness of everything else just rounds out the experience.I got a chicken shawarma plate. With a drink, it comes to just over $10, which seems like a lot, but you a good amount of food: the bottom of a steel disposable plate thick with hummus, two pitas, one falafel and a layer of chicken.The chicken was seasoned, but the hummus was fantastic. Fresh lemon juice makes all the difference with hummus. And the texture was good--smooth, and dippable with the pitas, which were nice and soft.Next time I&#39;m getting the falafel plate, because the falafel was the size of a hush puppy but tasted so, so much better. Fresh lemon (or is it lime?) juice on the inside, moderately crispy on the outside. I&#39;m looking forward to having more.Taza is a bit of a hike from River North, but it&#39;s worth making, and the accolades it has received are well deserved."

This is my new favorite lunch spot (as if I ever had one).It was nearly 0 degrees out and I dragged my lunch mate on a 15-minute walk for some grilled chicken. We each had an order of quarter chicken with dark meat, pita bread, and side of mashed potatoes and gravy. All that for less than $5! The chicken was well seasoned, moist, tender, distinctive, mouthwatering, enticing, etc. Okay, I&#39;m running out of adjectives. Just try it and thank me later.The only downside is it&#39;s messy and you will leave smelling like a grill. Don&#39;t take your office crush here.Note to self: I have to return and try the different bottles of sauce!"

I ordered the shrimp po Boy. The shrimp was wayyyy too fishy, tasted bad. :( they give you a massive amount of Bread too. The side of fries were bland, zero seasonings.The apps.

When walking up from the brown line I almost walked right by the place. It really feels like a neighborhood bar/pub. It was pretty empty, but that was probably due to being there so early. The weather was nice so we sat outside.Let&#39;s see here, beer selection was good though they were out of what I wanted. The bartender was pretty knowledgeable about their beers which is always nice. I had a burger which was quite big and cooked properly. Definitely made from scratch and not a frozen hockey puck. The toppings were fine and the bun was almost a large dinner roll. I liked it. The fries look to be handcut, but are pretty thick and were not crispy. Everything did come out hot and fresh though.Aside from the lackluster fries, I wasn&#39;t crazy about the other options on the menu. A Reuben would be an excellent addition I think. (If I missed it I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;ll edit the review later). The lady who was working the bar and waited on us was very pleasant and seemed to genuinely care that we were enjoying out visit. I really like places that are true to themselves and fit in well rather than catering to the pretentious hipster crowd. Definitely worth a return trip."

Are you freakin&#39; kidding me?!? I LOVE this place! I&#39;ve been coming here for years, since around the time it opened, and it&#39;s been better each time I&#39;ve come. I&#39;m not bringing my friend the pyro here though--there&#39;s not a candle she hasn&#39;t tried to reshape or stick something burnable into. A restaurant embarrassment.

How did I not know this place existed??Went there and ordered a chicken shawarma pita sandwich. Checked out their menu while I was waiting and saw that it&#39;s not just middle eastern but also wood fire oven pizzas! They all sound yummy too.I started talking to the owner (I think it was, just seemed like he would be) and I was telling him how I wish my work would cater from here instead of some of the very unhealthy food they usually do. Then my sandwich was ready but he had me a wait a couple mins longer and he ended up giving me two big sides of their homemade hummus and pita chips to bring back to my work for everyone.What a great, cheap place for a quick bite. (I left a menu along with the hummus in my works lunchroom- hopefully whoever does the ordering for catering sees it!)"

We were seated immediately and chose to soak in more sun on their outdoor patio. I like, I like.While we were taking our sweet time to order because we were waiting on another friend to arrive, our server went over the highlights. He was kinda awkward and a little condescending when someone asked how the menu is laid out and about making the burger at a certain temperature. That&#39;s the ish I don&#39;t like. Maybe he was just dehydrated?Everyone ordered a couple cold ones and a different funky menu item. I stuck with my veg burger, hubby had gyro, friends had forgettaboutit, wings, pulled pork mac, turkey burger and bison burger. Everyone loved it. I was proud of my restaurant-picking skillz. We enjoyed our time and didn&#39;t feel rushed even though the server kept being slightly weird.He did seperate our checks without giving us a hard time so that was a plus for a large group and we didn&#39;t get charged automatic gratuity or fees. Our waters were refilled 24/7 without being asked which was also essential on this mega hot day.Thanks for making me look slightly cool in front of my friends, BB!"

For starters, I tried the watermelon marg, which I enjoyed because I do love watermelon and the black salt they put around the rim added a cool touch. Our server said thier marg was voted top 10 in the city...I do beleive that is a slight exaggeration, although it was enjoyable.We tried both of the guacamoles which we enjoyed, but wished the helpings were bigger. small small smallFor tacos we tried:Ribeye Asada - DELICIOUS! The meat was tender and flavorful...I would try these again and wish we ordered morePastor de Trompo - 2nd favorite, very tasty!!Camaron en Salsa Verde - Just OK, the shrimp tasted fishy and I couldn&#39;t really taste the chorizo or bacon in itPancita - BLAH! I was excited for this one because I heart pork belly, but the meat was so flavorless... it needed salt bad, and that&#39;s never a good thing to admit!!When the waitress asked if we wanted to see a desert menu we politely declined and headed over to an ice cream shop in the west loop (see next review).In short, Mas has some potential. I would like to see them allow you to mix and match your tacos (big downfall). Maybe as it becomes MAS established, thier minor kinks will get worked out. :D"

I pass by this place many times and the vet I bring my dog is right across from here. I love Mediterranean food too, so I do not know what my excuse is for never coming here, but I sure do regret it. That is all in the past now because this place is yummy.I came here with my gf on a Sunday afternoon and it was kinda slow. We ordered herb fries, falafel wrap, and grilled steak shawarma. Everything was yummy and full of flavors! The herb fries is a must get.

Their rosemary chicken special looked very tasty as well. The employees are nice and they don&#39;t try to rush you out the door. The reason why I didn&#39;t give all 5 stars is because their high chairs were very dirty and sticky. I had to sit my two year old in that.
el-ideas-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ideas-chicago-2,06/15/14 , 5 ," I was planning on bringing my rescheduled Valentine&#39;s Day date here, but I was turned down. I know my fellow Yelper, you are stunned that (1) someone would turn down a free meal at a hot spot like EL Ideas and (2) that someone would actually turn down all this chocolate goodness.  Well it happened. Thankfully, I have awesome friends and one of them surprised me with an early birthday gift to EL Ideas.First, I need to say that the location of EL Ideas would make Mike Tyson a little nervous to venture into at night. However, once you step into EL Ideas you know you know you are in for an experience unlike one you have ever had before. There&#39;s limited seating, the stuffy atmosphere you experience at normal restaurants that do tasting menus will not be found here, the kitchen is in full view of the dining area and you can actually walk into the kitchen to talk with the chefs, it&#39;s BYOB, they have music playing that you would expect to hear at a frat party and you are encouraged to mingle with the other people dining there. **Note to reader - be sure to mingle with the other patrons dining there because you may get a bottle of wine from one of them like like I did. **Second, I want to acknowledge the EXCEPTIONAL service that you will find at EL Ideas. Everything was first rate! It was pretty awesome to get to talk and take pictures with the chefs and Phillip Foss (owner/head chef). Having them explain, in their own colorful way, each dish was highly entertaining.Third, the food was AMAZING. We were served 13 courses during the 3-hour tasting and of the 13 courses my friend and I went coco for cocoa puffs over 8 out of 13. I&#39;ve listed the courses below in the categories that they fall into.Amazeballs! So good I wouldn&#39;t share with the Pope or my mama#2 Halibut - This dish beautifully presented, cooked perfectly and tasted so good.#3 Cobia Collar - Which is a fish, was good and the flavors of curry, coconut and banana were like a firework of flavors to my sense of taste.#4 French Fries &amp; Ice Cream - When the dish was put in front of us, we were blown away by the drama of the presentation and we didn&#39;t believe it would taste like what we were told it would (a frosty from Wendy&#39;s with french fries dipped in it). However, as I brought my spoon to my mouth and took that first bite; I was thrilled that the taste matched the description spot on.#5 Soft Shell Crab - Now seeing how I love seafood, I knew exactly what this dish was when it was placed in front of me. This was my favorite of the night no diggity no doubt. Everything about this dish was perfection.#7 Foie Gras - It feels as if every fancy restaurant or tasting menu has foie gras on it. However, the chefs at EL Ideas stepped it up a notch with the huckleberry sauce that was poured atop of the foie gras.#8 Venison - I&#39;ve never seen Venison sausage until my bowl was placed in front of me. I thought the yogurt that came with the dish was a perfect compliment and really brought out the flavors in the sausage.#10 Antelope - I had never had antelope until dining at El Ideas and I am now a fan for sure. The meat was so tender and while the slice was on the small size, a lot of flavor was packed into that bite size portion.#13 Mudpie - The mudpie combined coffee, marshmallow an chocolate into a tasty dessert that concluded the tasting experience. The marshmallow was sticky like one you would find on a s&#39;more and the mini block of chocolate was fudgy goodness that made my teeth happy, but I&#39;m sure my dentist won&#39;t be.Really good#1 Roe#9 Bellota#12 ZucchiniInteresting (neither good or bad)#6 Snail - Was presented in a shot glass and had an interesting texture/taste to it.I would totally share with the Pope#11 Spruce - This dish was original in that we weren&#39;t given any utensils to eat it with; we had to lick the cream like substance off the little plate it came on. The chef warned us that some people love the dish and some people don&#39;t. I can tell you two things about this dish, which are (1) I felt like I was eating a Spruce Tree so the name fits it perfectly and (2) this was the only dish I of all 13 courses that I wasn&#39;t a fan of.Lastly, everyone who was celebrating a birthday, 3 of us, got a 14 course which was a confetti cake that had a chocolate cream like center. The cake was oh so good and a nice touch that just highlighted how awesome EL Ideas is.I&#39;ve been to a number of restaurants in Chicago that do tasting menus and EL Ideas is my favorite as of today because of the food, atmosphere, staff and service; which is why I am giving EL Ideas 5 stars.  I will definitely be going back to El Ideas in the near future!"

It&#39;s like your grandmother, if she were Mexican and a good cook, decided to install an industrial oven in her oversized kitchen and decided to sell food.The one bad is no liquor, but I guess in a way that is good. It is part of a store so you have to buy your drinks at the &#34;grocery&#34; part of the store. I hope you don&#39;t mind telenovelas because just like your at your Mexican grandmother&#39;s house (with the oversized industrial oven), it was on the one tv in the room.But hey, you are not here to hang. You are here to eat and eat good. They do carnitas on Sunday!"
312-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/312-chicago-chicago,02/17/14 , 5 ," My friend and I came here for a pre-theater dinner.  The place itself was nice and swanky, and we were able to score a booth by the window to watch the passerbyers. :D  We were given a basket of crusty bread, which came with a spicy oil (infused with chili peppers and such) - this was quite delicious!  Definitely different than just dipping the bread in olive oil and/or spreading it with butter.  I had the goat cheese ravioli with wild mushroom ragu - this was a little watered down, and I thought the sauce would be a little creamier; there were ample amounts of mushrooms and the raviolis were nicely filled with goat cheese.  For dessert, we had the chocolate tart and a cookie platter (with shortbread, amaretto, and biscotti).  The chocolate was encrusted with dark chocolate powder, and the cookie platter gave you a variety of the different cookies that you can try out.  Service was friendly!+spicy olive oil for bread dippage+friendly staff"
henrys-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-chicago-2,12/16/14 , 5 , Drinks - 5 starsFood - 3 starsGreat vibe and great drinks.They have a good list of unique cocktails.  I liked the one that was jalapeño infused.The food is mostly small bites but it&#39;s set in a way so you can order much or as little as you want and get your variety. it may not seem like much but things can add up quickly. Im sure the place gets a great profit margin with the menu set up with mostly sliders. The oyster slider with arugula was good and the pulled pork was okay too. I would probably try the lamb next time after having heard some good things.Their nacho appetizer is large and it needs to be shared.

From beginning to end, the staff is in character. Granted, there are many cheeseball and corn moments but overall it&#39;s interactive, it&#39;s lively and it&#39;s a great outing to change things up from your usual dinners out."
zizis-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zizis-cafe-chicago,08/29/13 , 5 ," Word to the wise...Don&#39;t go to Zizi&#39;s if you&#39;re on your way to some physical activity shortly after. I made that mistake and almost hurled up hummus which trust me is about as uncomfortable as it sounds.You literally can&#39;t stop eating here and they have huge portions so it&#39;s about the best place ever if you just plan on being a fatty for the rest of the day.The Iskander is insanely good. It&#39;s a lamb doner kebab and heavenly homemade Turkish bread covered with yogurt, garlic, and tomato sauce, Easily two meals, but as mentioned is tough to get your taste buds to quit so if you can&#39;t show restraint then you may want to stick with a sandwich or a wrap.The place works as a casual date spot cause it&#39;s BYOB or if you just want to pick up a quick lunch on your own it&#39;s great as well since there&#39;s a really attractive Turkish server to talk to.Overall an amazing experience!"
outdoor-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/outdoor-grill-chicago,05/27/14 , 5 ," Came here based on the Yelp reviews and I was going to be in the area. I had super high expectations for a great gyros place. I came in with a group of 4 and I ordered a #1 and a cream of chicken rice soup. The guy at the counter (presumably the owner) was very welcoming and friendly. He took all our orders swiftly and promised my soup immediately--which didn&#39;t exactly happen. We got our orders fairly quickly (3 #1s, an outdoor grill platter, the soup, breaded mushrooms and mac n cheese bites). And he still forgot my soup...eventually he brought it ):The owner noticed that all the seats in the restaurant only seated 4, so he told us we could grab a small table to extend the booth. After we had a few minutes to indulge, the owner stopped by and asked us what brought us here today. Since I&#39;m usually the one in the group that looks at Yelp reviews, I told him it was my idea to come here and he said that many people had come in that day because of Yelp. And was happy to serve us. He seemed to take a liking toward my friend and his jokes, so the owner offered him a sample of a milkshake he had just made. Uhmm, okay? What about the rest of us?My gyro was decent; nothing to brag about. I tried some of the other things my friends got and again, not spectacular. I&#39;m not usually in this area so I wouldn&#39;t drive this far for a gyro. I must admit that the menu is quite extensive and would cater to one&#39;s cravings!"
knife-and-tine-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/knife-and-tine-chicago-2,12/11/14 , 5 ," I came here for dinner with a friend on a cold Sunday evening and really enjoyed our meal.We sat at a table by the windows in a beautiful dining area (I believe the host called it the indoor &#34;courtyard&#34;). There were tall ceilings, dark wood, dim lighting and grey stones like a castle. Gorgeous space.The dining staff was excellent, our server gave great recommendations and had spunk and a sense of humor.Between two people we ordered:(Complimentary pumpkin bread)1. Duck skin chips2. Cheese plate3. Bone marrow bread pudding4. Chicken &amp; Dumplings5. Duck BologneseFive plates family-style was more than enough to share with plenty of leftovers to take home.The food was flavorful, rich and heavy. In my head, I kept thinking, &#34;winter food&#34; like stews and rich, deep flavors. From what friends from the west coast have told me, food in the Midwest is much heavier, and the dinner here fits that description. (At least, because we didn&#39;t order any salads and mostly stuck with stuff like cheese, duck, chicken and marrow).My drawback was that the food was a little salty. However the portions that I took home made excellent leftovers- I added the chicken and dumplings to a rice porridge (congee) to balance out the saltiness and it worked out even better.You&#39;ll find creative, new American cuisine in a gorgeous setting and it&#39;s a great spot to take friends. They have long tables available for larger parties. My favorite dish was the cheese plate and our server recommended that we eat from lightest to heaviest. It was SO so good. And their dishes are creative. You won&#39;t find bland flavors here, everything has a bold and unique taste.When you differentiate between eating and dining, at &#34;Knife &amp; Tine&#34; you&#39;ll definitely be fine dining."

acadia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/acadia-chicago,11/11/14 , 5 ," Great date night or business dinner if you are looking to splurge.Very professional service and presentations. They certainly try to impress by providing a few amuse-bouche throughout the meal including when you leave. It&#39;ll all the little details, clearing plates between dishes, folding napkins when you step away.. etc.In order of preference: we enjoyed the scallops appetizer, and lobster entrée. We also ordered the venison. This was our 1st time trying venison and it was just not something we were used to as well as it was very rare for our liking. all the little complimentary additions in each dish was tasty (multi colored potatoes, the coconut crème sauce and etc.).the gooey cake and the chocolate dessert was not a let down.I would definitely come back for drinks and they has a quite a nice selection to choose from. I may try to sit at the bar next time as it can get very pricy."

I really wanted to like this place because it has the nicest young womannamed Crystal working there and she was working really hard and was nice toeveryone..So, this review is absolutely no reflection on Crystal...However, we started off on a bad foot when I pretty much came to Turkey Choptoday because I was craving Turkey Spaghetti and I was told due to a largecatering order they had this morning they had no more spaghetti..Well, that pretty much sucked big time because thats what I really wanted but Inow had to find a substitution..So, I decided on these Honey Q&#39;d Turkey Tips and Some Turkey Chili..And I was offered my choice of 2 sides with the turkey tips and I chose garlicmashed potatoes and Italian style green beans, the sides were fantastic, theturkey tips were horrible..There were pieces of bones and gristle and fat??(Where the hell did the fat comefrom on that turkey?) and I actually wound up throwing most of it away..The turkey chili I thought had more promise but it was extremely/hot spicyand that kind of threw me..Also had 2 pieces of garlic bread that had way too much garlic salty stuff on it,Warning to any vampires.. Turkey Chop has lotsa garlic.. stay away.. or enterat your own risk!The restaurant interior is quite small, but there are about 8 tables, and they havesome lovely artwork on the walls, and.. they have Crystal..But, I will not be returning most likely, because for the most part exceptfor the phenominal sides this was not a good dining experience..2 gobbles is the best I can do..So disappointed...."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coalfire-pizza-chicago,04/05/14 , 5 ," I don&#39;t get the hype. I first learned of Coalfire on an episode of &#34;Check Please&#34; and couldn&#39;t wait to try it out. I love this type of pizza and prefer a thin, crisp crust over deep dish any day of the week. The boyfriend and I ordered 2 pizzas: a white pie (our favorite) and an &#39;Nduja pie (salami, mozzarella, basil). Not gonna lie, the crust was pretty good. It definitely wasn&#39;t on the same level as Grimaldi&#39;s in NYC but it was decent. Unfortunately, the pizzas didn&#39;t have much flavor. The white pie was pretty boring and the only thing that saved the &#39;Nduja pie was the spicy salami.On a side note, we also tried their cupcakes (courtesy of Chicago Cupcake). Take my advice and skip it! I&#39;m not sure if all the flavors are the same but the one we tried was more like a pie than a cake. It was super heavy and sweet -- definitely not my style."

I go get my hair cut across the street and although this place doesn&#39;t take plastic, I decided I have $10 bucks on me, let em get one of the #10. It is totally not what I thought it was. It was a long Sub like torta bread with milanesa (breaded steak) BACON, pineapple, avocado, and all the fixins. Not since Cemitas on the Northside have I tasted such bliss. I mean, I finally know what its like to have a taste bud orgasm! Sorry.....I am coming back to try some more but first another #10 because I have to relive this taste again and again.The place is rather small but can stuff quite a few people inside its Futball (spanish soccer) jerseys all over the place. What a rush I must say!If you are so tired of tortas and tacos, and feel like being adventurous (okay dramatics so what), this is the place. I am really loving it and those who know me realize that I never (or rarely) give out a five star. This place hit a home run for sure and I am elated for that!"

This restaurant is really small and very authentic. When I came here, I had a carne asada torta. My boyfriend ordered the barbacoa torta and we ordered a red tamale and a green tamale. The tamales were so good that I wanted to order like 20 more. The carne asada was hands down the best that I have ever had. It was a little crispy and just super delicious. I will definitely be back soon!"
papas-cache-sabroso-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/papas-cache-sabroso-chicago,03/17/14 , 5 ," I would just like to start this review with: Everyone should try a jibarito.On a recent trip to Chicago my wife and I were looking for a place to have lunch. We like to try types of food we haven&#39;t had before and whenever we end up in a bigger city than where we live I immediately search for something new. Reading about Chicago, I noticed they have a large Puerto Rican community. I was immediately interested and began looking for places and foods to eat. I noticed that there was a sandwich available called a jibarito that used fried plantains instead of bread. I decided I had to try this sandwich and set out on picking a restaurant.I picked Papa&#39;s Cache Sabroso and am so glad that I did. It&#39;s a little place that appears a bit run down on the inside and it was full so we had to wait a bit to be seated. When we sat down, I looked over the menu to find the jibarito. It is available with steak, chicken, or vegetarian option. I chose the steak jibarito and my wife chose the 2-piece dark rotisserie chicken.  They both came with rice and beans. The jibarito was so good. The simplicity of just steak, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and some sauce sandwiched between two starchy plantains was perfect. It made me want to eat every sandwich with plantains instead of bread. My wife&#39;s chicken was also perfectly roasted. I tried a piece of it and loved the perfectly spiced flavor and she was very happy with it.We will definitely be eating here again on future trips to Chicago."

The steak quesadilla here is the best I have ever had so far! I am not a fan of their steak tacos though. The service here is friendly and they open late. They also have a really good selection of ice cream here! I will definitely come back here. Good food good price!"

If I wanted Chinese food, I&#39;d ask my friend&#39;s mom to cook it because she&#39;s the best. It would be quite interesting to try this dish again with it sitting on top of something much more interesting like a passion fruit, red peppercorn orzo. I&#39;ve never EATEN or seen that offered before, but i can already TASTE it. :)And the plate ware is pretty dated. I&#39;m not hating on you, it just doesn&#39;t sell the dish or feel special whatsoever.But please never change what you&#39;re doing when it comes to selecting and cooking up such wonderful quality seafood."

It&#39;s like an old school Italian deli, with a section of tables so you can order at the counter and then eat in. I don&#39;t remember what I ordered -it was some kind of Italian sub sandwich -but it was really good. Nice crowd, good ambiance. It&#39;s really exciting to find some new places and get out of the Cicero rut!"

I also tried the empanadas de guayava, they are good. The size of the sandwiches is unbelievably huge at a really cheap price.The service is excellent. The owner/cook is really nice and helpfulThe place is very simple and clean.  This place is good for lunch or take out. Would not be good for a romantic dinner or upscale service.BTW, they have delivery, which is helpful when I don&#39;t want ot drive.The sandwich break has some real good food, better prices and helpful service."
big-bricks-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-bricks-chicago,07/25/14 , 5 ," I love Bricks pizza. And I love BBQ. So when I heard that Bricks had a second location with both of those things, my mind was blown and I knew I had to visit. Not sure what the crowd situation would be, I made a reservation for 4 at 8:00. When we arrived, the place was kind of crowded, but we could have definitely walked in without a reservation. The back patio area has a bunch of picnic tables and we opted to sit outside.Our waiter came over and was very helpful in guiding us through the menu. First, Big Bricks has a unique selection of draft beers which is awesome. Second, our goal was to try as much BBQ as possible, and we did just that. Starting with the nachos with brisket on top was a great move. The brisket is chopped in big pieces and incredibly flavorful. It really adds to the other delicious nachos components. This was also a huge serving. more than enough for the four of us. Deciding to add something remotely healthy into the mix, we ordered the beet salad, which was pretty standard and came with goat cheese and red onion. For pizza, we had to do BBQ chicken and it did not disappoint. As a semi-impulsive move, we also ordered some smoked chicken wings. We saw them going by to another table and, after staring longingly, could not resist. They were super tasty and delicious as well.Overall, I definitely recommend Big Bricks for a casual dinner. The back patio ambiance is great, our server was very attentive, and the food/beers were fantastic. Can&#39;t wait to head back and try more of that BBQ!"

I have passed this place a few times and decided I want to try it out.We sat down for drinks and some snacks. It is very fast and great for a quick drink/grub. The atmosphere is very relaxed and relatively dark. The music selection was ... Okay but I didn&#39;t mind it. The bartender greeted us immediately and told us the specials. We got the soup special.Pozole - $7 - this was soooo good. I absolutely loved the broth. It was flavorful without being too salty. The pork shoulder was tender and plentiful. The add ins were traditional: thinly sliced radish, cilantro, tortilla chips, minced onions and longitudinal sliced avocado. Of course we tossed EVERYTHING in the soup, as you do, and INDULGE YOUR FACE OFFFFF.Rock shrimp - $12 - the rock shrimp was great quality and tender. The fried portion was balanced and crunchy. I only wish there was more shrimp.I forgot the two cocktails we got but I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of either :-( they were only $10 tho so I was still content. I had the cocktail with the house made infused clove vanilla liquor. It had a smoky taste to it, I think the cloves were a bit over powering.Anyway, I would definitely check out this place. The food is great and cheap. Their fries sound deliciousssss. I wish I got them oh well. Next time."

berghoff-restaurant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/berghoff-restaurant-chicago-3,10/28/14 , 5 ," 3.5 StarsMy buddy and I walked aimlessly looking for a place to eat during lunch. I was being a child and kept vetoing everything. When he suggested Berghoff I was like &#34;Isn&#39;t that place expensive?&#34; Didn&#39;t realize they have a cheap café downstairs from the restaurant! It was a bit crowded, but the line moves fast. All of the Panini&#39;s and pasta&#39;s they had on display looked really good, but I opted to go with the Turkey Burger with Guacamole. It also came with a side of chips. The Turkey burger was tender and the Guacamole to me really made the burger. The confusing thing about ordering here though is they nickel and dime you for extra toppings. So for example if I wanted to add cheese it was going to be an extra 60 cents.If you don&#39;t add any extras though it was a reasonably price meal. There is also plenty of seating, which is nice, but I would opt to take my meal to go because it&#39;s so dark and windowless. Glad there is another option I can add to my list of places to go for lunch. Oh...and yes I did try the root beer they are known for and it&#39;s not bad. Pretty good compliment coming from someone that doesn&#39;t like beer/nor root beer. :)"

One bite later and I must confess that Heaven on Earth exists. This place was and is amazing. The chicken wings were freshly made to order. They were roughly $1 a piece but they are large and extremely flavorful. The sweet garlic and the spicy Korean sauce are a must try. In addition to this, I also had the opportunity to try the bibimbap and gyoza which were also phenomenal. Food is enough of a reason to give this place a try.Another outstanding quality that this place possesses lies within its customer service. The lady at the front was offering so much guidance in choosing what to order and she even gave us a few extra wings. She had a smile on the entire time and really valued her customers. She even thanked us when we left - so generous. Her efforts to keep us satisfied don&#39;t go unnoticed. I love this place and will definitely be back!"
la-scarola-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-scarola-chicago,08/19/14 , 5 ," As far as Italian food goes, I can&#39;t say I have had much that was better than La Scarola. The walk in to the restaurant is a little intimidating- packed with people, cramped space, and you feel like everyone is looking at you as you walk by.We had an 8pm reservation, and they had the appropriate sized table ready for us when we got there. We loved looking at all the pictures on the wall of famous, and not famous people who came to the restaurant. There was such a sense of pride in their restaurant. It definitely gave off that Italian family, old school vibe.Waters arrived quickly, as did someone to take drink orders. Beer selection is limited, but there was a nice wine selection.Large baskets of crusty Italian bread then arrived, which was good, but not hot out of the oven like I&#39;ve experienced elsewhere. For apps, we tried the mussels, grilled and fried calamari, and the shrimp armani. I&#39;d never had mussels before, and they were good, nothing I would think to order again, but my table deemed them the best mussels they&#39;d ever had. The shrimp armani was so fantastic- huge shrimp over delectable mashed potatoes in a red sauce... mmmmmmm.... and the fried calamari was the best I&#39;d ever had too! I did not try the grilled-- looked &#34;too real&#34; for me. My table said it was good, albeit a little too chewy.For the main course, I stuck with bowtie pasta with meatballs. A giant portion was given with 3 garlicky, perfect meatballs. It totaled up to 3 meals over a few days for me! Everyone else loved their dinners too, and everyone left with extras. Prices were very reasonable for what you got.The owner took time to speak to everyone there. He seemed to have some favorites who were given free shots, but alas, that was not us.Overall, it was a truly different but amazing Italian dining experience. I would go back in a heartbeat. On the way out, I realized that even though it is cramped, everyone was focused on their fantastic food and could care less at who was walking by! Thanks for a great night!!"

While there was a 30-40 minute wait this morning and no room inside to wait, the hostess offered us coffee while we were outside. Not a super cold day, but chilly enough where hot coffee was appreciated.Decided to try something new today. Went with The Works and it was amazing. Poached eggs with kale, cheddar cheese, potato hash, hollandaise sauce, a tomato and bacon.

However, there are a few things I can definitely say:(1) The value for money is outrageously good. The Polish plate is around 10 bucks and the amount you get is very generous. Not only that, but its savory and satisfying. It&#39;s really fast-food prices (or cheaper given the amount) but true, homecooked-tasting non-processed tasty food.(2) The service is friendly. Our waitress -- genuinely Polish 4 years in the States -- explained the options, provided recommendations, followed-up and gamely answered my parents&#39; questions about her life in Poland.(3) The interior definitely felt like I&#39;d stepped into a European family-owned restaurant reminiscent of our trips to Germany etc. It&#39;s comfortable, clean, charming and unpretentious.The cost versus value makes this a four-star review."
nookies-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nookies-chicago,11/30/14 , 5 ," Great portion.  Superbly bland in both visits.  Carb centric menu.  Flavor is derived from ketchup, sour cream, hot sauce and a side of greasy salty bacon.HUEVOS CON CHORIZO ($9.45) -- flour tortilla was the sign.  Beans tasted from can.  Greek rice pilaf instead of Mexican rice.  Bland chorizo was nicely blended with egg.BLACKENED TILAPIA -- overcooked tilapia, spinach overwhelmed by garlic slice, and the questionable sweet potato mash.BOTTOMLESS COFFEE ($2.45) -- in both instances: slow refill, coffee is barely hot.  Ordinarily bitter.SWEET AUTUMN TRIO -- love the tasting concept that is loaded with 100% empty carbs.MENU -- a whole lot of nothingness.VENUE -- dining floors are unreasonably dirty at 11:45 am, even though they opened at 6:45 am.SERVICE -- the only reason for 2 stars.  Wally is great as he is conscientious of coffee refill, helpful, a team worker.  Ruben showed up and disappeared.  The Host Dude seats you at table first, then counter."
a-tavola-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-tavola-chicago,05/18/13 , 5 ," A Tavola is one of those places that you almost don&#39;t want to share with others as it is so delightful that you selfishly want to keep it to yourself.  It is a Chicago gem.  It&#39;s location inside a townhouse makes the experience even more intimate and special.  The Chef owner is charming and makes you feel like a welcome and special guest in his home.  There has been lots said about the gnocchi, and food in general, and there is nothing I can add other than it is fabulous.The menu selection is small and changes frequently but the few items that are on the menu are  fresh, well executed and delicious without being overly fancy in presentation. The Chef, who lived in Italy for years, uses fresh spices and ingredients from his own garden to create menus he designs from various regions of northern Italy.Weeks later, we still talk fondly with our friends about the wonderful, tasty food and delightful experience we had at A Tavola. Can&#39;t wait to go back!"
bullhead-cantina-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bullhead-cantina-chicago,08/19/13 , 5 ," Wise men say...Only fools rush in,But I ~ can&#39;t ~ help ~ falling in love ~ with you...I fell in love with Bullhead Cantina Saturday evening. They have a couple tables outside on their little patio but my friends and I hung out inside. We all commented on how nice it was that they were playing great music at a normal human being volume. It wasn&#39;t so loud we couldn&#39;t hear a thing! We were able to speak to each other at normal levels and enjoy each other&#39;s company. Oh! And we saw Nishan P. randomly here! :)The tables are nice high tops and made for comfy seating. I loved the decor, loved the atmosphere, had such a relaxing fun time. The staff was really friendly and accommodating which was appreciated. Cash Only!!!! They have an ATM in the back just in case you need it. One side of the street is meter parking but the other side is FREE! Why not park on the free side, right? And the best part of it all....$6 for a taco, beer and shot!!! The shot was of a Whiskey and the waitress put all of ours on the rocks - super sweet to help us weaksauces out. The tall boy was a PBR and I had to assist in finishing some of my friends&#39; off....I&#39;m here to help! Their craft beer prices are fabulous aside from this super $6 special &amp; great daily specials, as well.The taco choices are AWESOME! They have a ton of cool tacos to choose from including some really unique combinations. I had a Sweet Potato Taco and the kitchen had no issue leaving an ingredient off for me. I&#39;ve never had a sweet potato taco before and hesitated a bit when ordering. When the taco came and I had my first bite any whiff of indecision dissipated completely. The creamy lime &amp; avocado sauce on the potato paired with it surprisingly well. Explosion of flavor! My friends all added tacos onto the special and at $3 each, they&#39;re a fantastic deal.This is my new favorite place. I&#39;m dying to go back yesterday. Who&#39;s coming with me!?"
paladar-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/paladar-chicago-2,11/16/14 , 5 ," I dined here last week with my husband and parents after seeing this place featured on Check Please. We all adored Paladar!! We went on a Monday so didn&#39;t try any cocktails or rum flights, but have to save something for next time right??We started with the tostones, and the dipping sauces they give you to supplement your apps are just awesome!!Next time I go, I will have a hard time not getting the same exact thing I ordered the first go round - the Palomilla. It was a thin steak topped with seasoned onions and I opted for the side of Fufu (mashed plantains) instead of rice. I would have a hard time finding a fault with any of it, and next time I&#39;ll be tempted to order about 4 sides of the Fufu. Amazing.My whole party basically didn&#39;t speak after our food was delivered- we just shoveled. It was that good.I look forward to returning on a weekend so I can try the cocktails!"
pl-zen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pl-zen-chicago,08/17/14 , 5 ," I didn&#39;t know much about this place going in, but was pleasantly surprised and highly satisfied.  Based on appearance, I pegged it for merely a glorified bar; but the menu is somewhat more sophisticated, though without egregiously higher prices to match.  Best of all, the food turned out to be excellent, so I would chalk this up as a great value and unexpected gem.  Plus the service was really sweet. too.To start off with, I ordered the cocktail of the day, which included gin, St Germain, green tea, lemon juice, chia seeds and maybe one or two other ingredients which I&#39;ve forgotten.  It was pretty good, especially for the price.The brussels sprouts side was our only disappointment, but a mild one.  We asked to omit the bacon, and the sprouts were steamed, which does not bring out the inherent flavors of the vegetable like roasting or frying.  But still, there was a nice balsamic glaze, and a mediocre brussels sprout is still worth eating.Other than that, the food was outstanding.  I absolutely loved the calamari, which was not as crisp as it could have been but also was not sodden with grease like at most places.  The batter had a really engaging flavor, and I could have eaten the calamari on their own, but the accompanying sauce was delicious too.  The fish tacos were really good, the sesame seeds enhancing an otherwise traditional preparation.  I never order a veggie burger in a restaurant, but theirs sounded so compelling that I couldn&#39;t resist.  It was delightful--mushrooms, onions, guacamole, and all the other ingredients singing together in beautiful harmony.The burger came unexpectedly with a giant pile of fries, making this meal an even better value.  (Plus the fries and accompanying special ketchup were as great as the rest of the food.)  Our bill came to only $50 for two appetizers, two entrees, a cocktail, and tax.  That was money very well spent.We don&#39;t get down to Pilsen very often, but Pl-zen is now permanently bookmarked in my restaurant cortex."
gios-cafe-and-deli-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gios-cafe-and-deli-chicago,05/02/14 , 5 , Great food!BYOB.The grilled calamari is a must!Will definitely go back to explore the rest of the menu!
esencia-urban-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/esencia-urban-kitchen-chicago,10/14/14 , 5 ," Yet another place to go out for breakfast within a few blocks of our apartment, this time with a faintly Mexican theme.  The dishes are pretty tasty, although service is a little uneven (not a lot of staff) and so is some of the quality (my salad greens were wilted).In a neighborhood thick with breakfast joints, Esencia&#39;s comparative advantage is probably the ambience and charm.  This is a tiny little glass-covered storefront filled with light and seating only about a dozen people.  The result is that it&#39;s cheerful and lively, but without the kid-dominated chaos of Ann Sather, the eternal florescence of Melrose Diner, or the hipness of Kanela Breakfast Club.  Sometimes that&#39;s exactly the feeling you want, and for that reasons Esencia retains some merit in the crowded breakfast field of East Lakeview."
breakfast-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/breakfast-house-chicago,04/28/14 , 5 ," Breakfast House was stop #1 for a friend and me when we had a big day planned, consisting of power shopping and then some power hitting in volleyball. I can&#39;t say this meal helped with the shopping at all, but my athletic ability was greatly enhanced that day and I would like to attribute it to the magic hash I consumed.For starters, $2.50 for unlimited intelligentsia coffee is already a win. My dining companion had the cornmeal cakes, while I had the breakfast house hash, and we were both very pleased with our meals. The portions aren&#39;t outrageous like some other brunch places, but just the right amount so you can lick your plate clean and not feel like a total cow afterwards. The service was a little slow, but given that it&#39;s a small spot and they&#39;re already very busy at 9am, you really can&#39;t dock them too many points. Plus, whatever points you do dock can be easily made up by the readily available (free) parking and cute, welcoming atmosphere."
red-hot-ranch-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hot-ranch-chicago-3,06/02/14 , 5 , For a burger similar to in n out this is probably the best spot in Chicago.The patties are thin and the sauce works well with the burger.For burger and fries you&#39;re looking at under five bucks which is a pretty solid deal.The main problem I had with this place was ordering. For a QSR they are pretty slow and don&#39;t really tell you how their ordering process goes. Some signs or verbal guidelines would be helpful. I ended up sitting down for longer than expected and waiting but not knowing if I should pay or if my ordered would be called out when ready.
honky-tonk-bbq-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/honky-tonk-bbq-chicago,09/23/14 , 5 ," I think that this is a 3-4 star place.  But I am bordering on 3 for a few reasons.  (Side note, my meal was a 4).I was with a friend there- their ribs were quite fatty and cooked to non-precision.  The music in the front room was good, but the volume was blaring so loud that I could not think while making my order.  We went to the eccentric back room and enjoyed the experience much- MUCH more.  I had pulled pork- it was terrific.  The mac &#39;n cheese.  My god its rich and wonderful.So... the food was good on my end.  The atmosphere once escaped form that dreadful noise was great- and my co-diners meal was &#34;meh.&#34;I would go back."
theory-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/theory-chicago-2,04/30/14 , 5 ," I love THEORY!! :) This is my go to happy hour spot and I take everyone here. Every day of the week there are specials (even the weekends). The service is great, the location is great, and the owner is definitely great. Such a friendly young guy that goes around and greets all of the patrons. Once me and my girls came in here and his friends were sitting at one of the table. He made them move so we could sit down. Another time my friends and I came after work to celebrate my friends new job and he gave us all free shots....see a trend. The owner is great, so it makes the establishment great.I would definitely recommend the steak quesadillas. I get them every time I come here. Recently I went away from my normal drink and tried the Salted Carmeltini....delicious! Another plus is the music and it&#39;s definitely a great place to watch a game. Sometimes I have spent 4+ hours here in one visit."
petterinos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/petterinos-chicago,11/17/14 , 5 ," We ate at Petterino&#39;s before IL Trovatore at the Lyric opera.  We were there around noon and subsequently ordered off of the brunch menu.First, I ordered a &#34;Matilda&#34; cocktail.  Heaven!!  Highly recommended!For brunch I ordered the Short Rib Chilaquiles -  (look it up!)  A -  This dish was a somewhat latin influenced crispy tortilla tower.  It was truly unique, huge and really tasty.Service was solid and the dessert cart was overwhelming.  I would definitely eat here again!  (see photos as well!)"
talay-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/talay-chicago-chicago,06/26/14 , 5 ," I had never heard of Talay before, but saw it on the listing of establishments participating in sushi week. What won us over was it&#39;s BYOB and we love venturing to West Loop for the free parking. Our reservations were at 7:30pm. The place is cute, but we were a little taken aback there was absolutely no one there. That&#39;s hard to believe after trying there food....everything was amazing!!! We were there from 7:30pm till close at 10:00 and had the whole restaurant to ourselves. There were many people stopping in for pick up orders though and I believe they also do delivery.It was already a good night cause I got to hang with my &#34;black version&#34; of sex and the city crew :) The service was great! Our waitress was really friendly and fast. We were starving and our meals were prepared fresh and brought out to us moments after ordering. We started with the Crab Rangoon,  Shrimp cakes, and Thai rice. I&#39;m not a huge fan of fried food, but it was sooo good! They had some sort of red sauce at the table we paired with the Thai rice and it really brought out the flavor.Now onto the sushi...which I was extremely impressed with the presentation. It looked like a work of art. (Please definitely view pictures). We ordered 3 rolls (Godzilla (1/2 off during sushi week), Black Hawk, and Black Pearl). All three were yummy, but my favorites were a tie between the Godzilla and the Black Pearl. We were stuffed! The rolls are extremely big...totally not complaining. You definitely get your money&#39;s worth. I must talk about the price because for this quality of food the price was really affordable. Since it&#39;s BYOB your already saving money, but between the four of us for all that food we paid about $17.00 apiece. Sushi week at Talay was a very enjoyable experience and we will be back for more sushi rolls and the excellent service of the staff."
tabaq-restaurant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tabaq-restaurant-chicago-3,12/18/14 , 5 ," ALWAYS OPENI have been dying to eat here for years. I always drive by &amp; there is not a single parking spot outside on the street. All of those spots are always occupied by taxis. I even got an incredible recommendation from Dr. Nishan, a fellow Yelper, whose review about Tabaq is quite humorous. Nishan calls it his favorite and now I know why.We were driving down the street when I saw a cab pulling out of a parking spot. We were hungry &amp; decided today was the day we try Tabaq. We walked in &amp; were greeted by the owner. He was so friendly and we loved talking to him. He went through all of the dishes and pointed out his favorites. We were so excited and couldn&#39;t decide. He even gave us a sample. After our sample we were sold &amp; placed our order.We ordered a Haleem which is ground dal (lentil) with shredded beef. It came with a salad, fresh baked naan &amp; a mint-cilantro sauce called raita. The haleem was so good and spicy. It was perfect food for a cold chilly day in Chicago. The spice warmed up every inch of my body. The dish would not win any awards for looks but it is a perfect 5 stars based on taste. If you don&#39;t believe me then go &amp; check my photo but it&#39;s an ugly dish. Ha! I can hardly wait to come back &amp; have this again.We read several reviews about the Chicken Biriyani being the best item on the menu. We couldn&#39;t deny all of those comments &amp; we went for it. The plate was huge. It was stacked so high it almost touched the ceiling &amp; I must admit it was everything everyone was is it would be. I would definitely order this item again on a return trip. It came with a side salad &amp;!three chunks of chicken on the bone. I really had to work the chicken because it was not the user friendly chicken we all get at an American restaurant. This was meat chunks with tiny little bones everywhere. If you&#39;re looking for easy then this place is not for you. I love authentic and in my heart I feel like this place delivered.Our two dishes were a ton of food and we had a feast on our table. The owner came over to check on us &amp; we were so excited about the food. He even brought over a ground chicken kabob patty with grilled onions &amp; jalapeños. The patty was dry but full of fantastic flavors. It was the best chicken burger I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m so glad the owner brought this over because I was curious about how it tasted. It was a new way of serving chicken kabobs and much more easier to eat.The owner even brought over Kheer which is a rice pudding with hints of cinnamon. He told us to eat it after we finished our food. It was really cute. He didn&#39;t want us to eat dessert before we cleaned our plates off. This was a perfect way to end our late lunch. It wasn&#39;t too sweet but had the right amount of flavor.We made our way back to the counter to pay for our meal. Yes they are very trusting here and you pay after you are done eating. All dishes are $8 except for the grilled fish which is $10. It makes it totally easy to order and pay.Of course we started talking to the owner and he talked about the special Halal meat. He also informed us that it was much more expensive the normal meat from Jewel. I knew most of this but it&#39;s great to hear a restaurant owner talk with pride about the quality of his food. He also told me to come back any time because he never closes. I wish I was still in my younger years because this place would be my new 3am burrito joint. It&#39;s funny how time changes and lifestyles change.The owner asked me to come back this Friday after 2pm because he is making chicken kabobs that will impress me. I told him I couldn&#39;t make this Friday but I would defiantly come back on an upcoming Friday. I just thought he was such a nice person and is everything you want in a restaurant owner. His friendliness &amp; kindness towards us makes us want to come back again &amp; again.If you do decide to come here then don&#39;t be afraid. There is a good chance you will be the only person here who doesn&#39;t drive for a living. Not once will you feel out of place. Eating here reminds me of my culinary adventures around the world but I&#39;m in my own backyard of Chicago. This is why I love this city. You can drive from neighborhood to neighborhood to get the most authentic traditional food ever. This makes Chicago a culinary treat for me.We also met a doctor who comes in here every day for a green tea chai with milk. He recommended we get one, while we were talking to the owner. Next thing we knew the owner had poured two for us to take. This place rocks. I had never had this drink but it was unique and good. Honestly this place is the best.In closing, thanks to the owner for caring about newbie customers. You invited us in &amp; treated us to a grand experience. We can not wait to come back &amp; eat here again. We also learned that the food changes daily at the back counter, so we could have a different food adventure every day of the week and at any hour. We&#39;re ready for that challenge."
mercat-a-la-planxa-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercat-a-la-planxa-chicago,06/23/14 , 5 ," We grabbed dinner here with a rather large group (I think there were 10 of us) late on a Saturday night, so I&#39;m glad they were able to accommodate us. We ordered a couple pitchers of the white sangria, which was delicious. Just a little pricey.I liked pretty much every dish that we ordered. The one that sticks out the most to me were the bacon wrapped dates (you can never go wrong with those) and the garlic shrimp. It was so juicy and flavorful.Oh yeah, the paella was amazeballs. I really loved the black rice!"
park-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-tavern-chicago,03/05/14 , 5 ," I am a return customer for a reason.Good selection of food,  good service,  and the atmosphere is nice and clean.Depending on when you go, it can get pretty busy. But nevertheless the food is Yum yum.I went there for lunch yesterday with my work partner.We shared the Italian beef pizza. Super delicious but after a while it was too cheesy for me.He had the pear salad which was so tasty and unique.  He also had the chicken tacos which comes with beans and rice.  It&#39;s a really big dish for lunch so you will have leftovers. I&#39;ve had the chicken tacos before and I can&#39;t really complain about them. They have a nice spicy kick to them."

Clarkes, however, it&#39;s no longer there.  Now it&#39;s Bellwether Meeting House &amp; Eatery.  Please note... this is an over due review....The owners certainly did an amazing job of decorating the restaurant with the hanging of the crystals from the ceiling to the brightness of the room to the bar area.  I will say, the only negative item are the &#34;booths&#34;.  The booths are a little uncomfortable.  The booth seating will be a little hard to explain so here goes.... the bench is shared between and the guest behind you.  When that person moves, you can really feel it.  Same with the backing of the booth.  The seating  can be a little frustrating.I was greeted by the hostess and was sat promptly.  The server was very prompt.  He went over the menu and took the drink order.  When he returned with my beverage, he took my order.  I had ordered the cheeseburger (medium).Within the appropriate time, my meal was delivered.  The burger was just right.  I was surprised how juicy the burger was.  No complaints here.  The serve did check in without being bothersome.Based on my experience, I would return."
soupbox-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soupbox-chicago-5,12/08/14 , 5 ," Just what I needed feeling under the weather on a December afternoon.My little peanut gave me her cold, so I decided to seek out some soup. A few coworkers recommended Soupbox, and so despite the 6-block walk (which is long enough to Divvy) I decided to give it a go.I sampled the clam chowder, which this day was served Manhattan-style. It was good but I prefer my clam chowder white, so I went with the wild rice and cream of chicken soup in a breadbowl.The breadbowl is excellent. I grabbed a sourdough breadbowl (I can&#39;t remember if there&#39;s any other type) and it was fine-crumbed, for a sourdough, and very flavorful. Then soup itself had discretely chewy rice and good chicken chunks and flavor. Better than anything I could pull together at home, that&#39;s for sure.Next time I&#39;m feeling under the weather, I&#39;ll be willing to give Soupbox a spin."
go-4-food-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/go-4-food-chicago,08/17/13 , 5 ," Great little place on a side street in Chinatown. Clean, friendly, and superb food. Lunch is an incredible bargain for under $7, but we chose to explore the main menu, which is also reasonably priced.We tried the Salty Egg Yolk Shrimp, Dungeness Crab Curry, and the French Beef. All were excellent.I would have liked the shrimp a bit crispier; it&#39;s definitely worth $2 extra to have it shelled.If only the crab could be shelled! It was our favorite dish because of the rich spices in the curry, but it was an absolute mess to eat because it&#39;s a whole crab covered in curry sauce, and you have to crack the shells; but hanging onto something covered in hot, slippery sauce is a real challenge. They can do other proteins with this sauce, and that&#39;s what I&#39;d get next time.I&#39;d definitely get the French Beef again. It was wonderfully tender cubes of beef with an aromatic crust. No Frenchmen were harmed in the preparation of this dish.This is definitely a non-touristy place to have great food in Chinatown."

The food is pretty decent, not much to complain about.However, my service tonight was deplorable.  A group of my friends had decided that this would be a nice place to meet for our annual girls night dinner/ drinks. We did it once before and the experience was decent. We came back tonight and were rushed, to say the least. We had a group of of six and were seated around 7pm. We ordered meals and drinks but after an hour were told the kitchen was closing, then, about 20 minutes later we told it was last call. I had barely touched my meal and was planning to have a few drinks. Anyway, within minutes we were asked to box everything up and were given the checks. We paid but continued to finish our drinks and were then kicked out! The man who kicked us out was soo rude! The place wasn&#39;t supposed to close until 10 and we were asked to leave before 9pm.Never in my life have I been treated in such a rude fashion. I was forced to stand outside in 20 degree weather to wait for my ride because they would not allow us to wait inside at 9pm! I understand wanting to close early on a slow night, but you do not do that when you have PAYING customers who intended to have a nice night out.Needless to say we will never be back. How rude, south branch."
la-bomba-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-bomba-chicago-4,01/23/14 , 5 ," Wanted something to eat on my way to work. I looked this place up and placed an order over the phone. I ordered a steak jibarito with the Puerto Rican rice. When I walked in to pick my order up, the entire place smelled delicious. My food was amazing and perfectly flavored.  The staff was just ok but the food was amazing. I will definitely visit again"
epic-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/epic-burger-chicago,03/04/14 , 5 ," This was a much improved experience from the Streeterville location. The people here actually seemed to care about their business, your experience, and what they are selling you. I enjoyed the burger more this time, but again its not the best burger in the world and for the price I would like it to be slightly better.Its also a difficult location to get to by any other way but on foot. The parking is not good in this area and you&#39;ll end up paying through the nose unless you take the el or are already in the area."

You can&#39;t miss the big green sign if you&#39;re driving on 90/94W. The parking lot is pretty small, but there is an attendant there to let you know of any open spots. If this were closer to home, I would probably come here more often. The prices are what you&#39;d expect from any Asian market: GREAT!!!There&#39;s also a little food stand at the back of the store with some good, fast eats."

But maybe it gets rowdier later.... we ended leaving for somewhere else with more liveliness.The drinks weren&#39;t bad though--- but then again, nothing really amazing. Doesn&#39;t make my list of memorable rooftops in Chicago."
the-art-of-chicken-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-art-of-chicken-chicago,06/17/14 , 5 ," Price has gone up from $10.99 to $13.99 for a whole chicken. The El Jefe was pretty darned tasty, whatever it is they smear it in. The skin was super crispy and full of flavor, although the flavor didn&#39;t fully penetrate the chicken. If they were to marinade the chicken for longer, find bigger chickens, and lower the price, that would probably bring this review up to 5 stars.Service was awesome I have to say. I was working out and called about 25 min before close to ask if I could place an order for pickup at around close. Lucky me, they said yes! The girl on the phone was friendly and my order was ready for pickup when I got there so I was in and out in 5 min."
may-st-café-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/may-st-caf%C3%A9-chicago-3,02/18/14 , 5 ," Disclaimer... I&#39;m not a huge fan of Mexican food, Latin flavors, or spicy stuff. I came here with a group from the office on a colleague&#39;s recommendation. I&#39;ve never ventured into the neighborhoods of Chicago beyond downtown/near north, so driving through Pilsen was quite an experience. The exterior of this restaurant? Sort of eerie, especially when it&#39;s dark and the middle of winter.I was pleasantly surprised by the interior of the place. Cozy and welcoming, but a tad too dark for me. The service was outstanding, everybody was warm and inviting.I&#39;m incredibly picky when it comes to my mojitos, they&#39;re usually too sweet or too tart, but the strawberry mojito was on-point. Actually, it was probably one of the best mojitos I&#39;ve ever had.To start, we ordered guacamole, queso fundido, Caesar salad, truffle mac &#39;n&#39; cheese, and a couple of other plates. As a main dish, I split the shrimp pasta with a colleague. Holy guacamole, everything was beyond delicious. How does a place like this have the best truffle mac &#39;n&#39; cheese I&#39;ve ever tasted?! I don&#39;t even know.I don&#39;t have a complex palette or array of descriptive words that foodies use to describe their culinary experiences, but let me just tell you: the food at this place is damn tasty. And the service was great, too. I ended up taking the shrimp pasta to go and gave it to my dad to reheat for his lunch the next day. He, like me, doesn&#39;t really like Latin foods, and was super hesitant about the dish. But that day, I received a text message from him telling me it was delicious. Who knew? I recommend May Street Cafe without any hesitation.EDIT: Forgot to mention, the white chocolate flan and lava cake are to die for."

Right away I put it on my to visit list.I was here with a friend for breakfast and I have to say that all we had was a chicken burrito and a steak burrito.They were huge in size but OK in flavor.The place is small and a little awkward, which I wouldn&#39;t care as long as the food was worth it. service is nice.They also close early."

fahlstroms-fresh-fish-market-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fahlstroms-fresh-fish-market-chicago-2,12/21/14 , 5 ," Look for seafood on 100 menus in Chicago and you can choose from exactly the same two, salmon and tilapia. And maybe whitefish. Then there was Glenn&#39;s, and now Fahlstrom&#39;s. Yes, seafood that actually runs the gamut and might cause you to try something new (cobia anyone?). So what if this fellow is a little eccentric---nice cereal boxes, guy!! He delivers the goods when it comes to seafood like few others in this city. He&#39;s in the restaurant a lot but never says hello or stops by to chat--that is a little off-putting for a repeat customer.At this new spot you will find the same wide selection of entrees and the same relatively high prices--but we get it, it&#39;s fresh seafood. I also noticed an inordinate number of kids under the age of 10 dining here--but who knows, maybe they&#39;re eating cereal. Adults can escape to the bar area. My swordfish steak couldn&#39;t have been better prepared, moist and tasty, with sides of cole slaw and potato salad that were fine and a buttery dinner roll. The key lime pie was nothing to write home about. Service was nice, with not just the bartender but others behind the counter stopping by to chatIf you&#39;re inspired, you can pick up fresh seafood to cook at home on the way out. But with Fahlstrom&#39;s open for business, you might think, why bother? I&#39;ll just come here."
el-faro-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-faro-restaurant-chicago-2,08/28/14 , 5 ," Started work in the Little Village area so naturally I had to check out el Faro. 12:30 on a weekday and this place is packed already with families and teens in the area. I came with a pretty big group so we had to all split up to sit down at once. I tried out the Bistec a la plancha (thin steak with avaocado) which was mighty tasty. The steak was seasoned well and tender and all the flavors on the plate worked well together. Nothing too unique about the experience but it&#39;s definitely a solid meal for under $10. While scrolling through yelp, I noticed a lot of people raving about the black beans so I had them. Definitely some of the best  I&#39;ve had (though I wondered to myself how good can black beans get?) although they are in great need of salt.Service here was friendly and our server came to check up on us a bunch. My friend really enjoyed the horchata so maybe that&#39;s something to try next time. Solid place for some grub!"

Place is BYOB, which was great. Everyone brought whatever they liked to drink and we shared. Everyone was super happy with their meals. I personally tried the bacon wrapped dates, the Southern Poutine (sweet potato fries w/ gravy and meat), the shredded beat salad and, for my entree, the root beer glazed brisket with grits. All really, really good.The actual restaurant is really cool. A very modern, open space. The server, Rianna, was very sweet and accommodating.This was a classy place. There were a few other tables occupied by either couples or groups of friends. Actually, we were a bit loud and rambunctious and I felt a little bad. We work in a heavy industrial workplace and our language can be quite colorful at times. However, the staff was cool and there were no complaints so I know next time that we likely need to dial it back a bit!This is located close to work so I&#39;m excited to try it for lunch too once the weather is a bit nicer!"
shawarma-garden-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shawarma-garden-chicago,02/21/14 , 5 ," I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It could easily be passed by for other, older Division Street establishments, but finally I made it in.It&#39;s very much fast mediterranean food. Not much in the way of ambience inside so I think Shwarma Garden will be a carry-out over a sit down place. That&#39;s exactly what I did. The employees (3 gentlemen) were attentive, polite, but definitely busy. I decided to go with the veggie combo platter. Not only do you get to try a variety of options, it&#39;s the cheapest item on the dinner entree section of the menu! Score for being a vegetarian! The veggie combo was delicious. You get 3 dolmades (stuffed grape leaves with rice), tabouleh salad, hummus, 3 falafel with 4 pieces of pita bread (technically two whole pitas sliced in half). Quite the feast!The only thing that is disappointing to me is the lack of french fries. Maybe that&#39;s a tradition to me but when I get mediterranean, I usually get some fries and tzatziki. Oh well, you can&#39;t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you might find yourself happily stuffed with yummy foods from Shawarma Garden. So if you&#39;re in the neighborhood, check it out!"

Apple fritter, coconut and pineapple, and my favorite - caramel covered pumpkin filled. The pumpkin filling was amazing. It was more like lightly whipped pie filling that you could taste the pumpkin in. In the plague of pumpkin spice that has set in - this was the authentic real deal.  The only one I was not crazy about was a ham and honey mustard one. I tried it because I was curious - and it was not bad, it was just not my taste.Coffee was great too - slow pour. I am a big fan of that!"

Delicate flavors blended artistically to create a very memorable dish!I also tasted a pork ( good, but not my thing) and a tortellini dish. The tortellini was excellent but needed a salt warning as it was heavily doused.Fantastic lunch!"
yummy-yummy-noodles-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yummy-yummy-noodles-chicago,10/27/14 , 5 ," For Asian moms who love noodle soup, this is manna from heaven. The aptly named Yummy Yummy Noodles (so tasty you have to moniker it twice) makes delicious bowls of soup with delicious noodles.It&#39;s located in the &#34;food court&#34; on one end of the new Chinatown plaza. Walk straight down, and it looks like one of the dilapidated food courts you find in Asia where your cousins take you to get the &#34;proper&#34; Asian food.Two bowls of soup--one wonton, one beef noodle--costs about as much as the El fare for two on the red line to get down here. The soups are Cantonese-based. Heck of a wonton soup, and the signature &#34;light and sweet&#34; beef broth that&#39;s closer to pho than my preferred Taiwanese niu rou mien.I&#39;m not quite sure when it opened, but the sparse reviews mean it&#39;s either pretty new or located in an absurdly bad spot. I&#39;m also not quite sure how my mother-in-law and aunt stumbled upon it, but they left raving. After a visit, I can vouch for this place being one of the hidden gems in Chicago&#39;s Chinatown."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/windy-city-cafe-chicago,08/09/13 , 5 ," Generic name, but still a great little neighborhood breakfast and lunch spot off of the Blue Line.Blindly you&#39;d probably be able to guess almost every single item on the menu. They do eggs, waffles, pancakes, sandwiches, and everything else you&#39;d imagine a neighborhood diner to be doing. All pretty tasty, but personally I go with their huevos rancheros. They&#39;re pretty legit.The price point isn&#39;t Denny&#39;s but you&#39;re definitely getting better quality, hot coffee, and super friendly service which is always worth a couple extra bucks."
bar-takito-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-takito-chicago,08/24/14 , 5 ," Takito.  A creative name for a new creative place in the W Loop.The space is set up the same way it was when it was Kaboucha with a large bar in the back corner and the seating areas up front.  There is also an outside patio area where you can listen to the &#34;El&#34; rumble by overhead as this place sits in the shadow of the Morgan/Lake &#34;El&#34; stop in the W. Loop.  But it&#39;s there where the similarity stops as this place is very cool with the graffiti wall art, large lit letters spelling out the name across the ceiling and the industrial, fun seating areas.We came during their second week of being open and there was none of the &#34;new restaurant blues&#34; that you can sometimes experience when a new place opens but this is probably due to the fact that this is a &#34;sister&#34; restaurant to Takito Kitchen in WIcker Park so they know how to service the customer.  The service was spot on, the pacing with the kitchen good and the food was tasty.  If there was any hiccup it was that the drinks were a little slow to come from the bar.We were seated on time for our reservation and Alex, our server, was over in a flash to tell us about Bar Takito.  The drink menu has plenty of specialty cocktails and all of the standards, including a delicious margarita made with fresh juices.  My friend had their cucumber margarita and that was delicious, cool and refreshing.As for food, Alex told us the best way to do the menu is through a series of share-able plates.  He pointed out his favorites and we just decided to let him lead the way.  First up- two kinds of ceviche and the grilled octopus.  The salmon ceviche was my favorite with jalapeno, corn and tomatoes.  This was served with fried plantains  but take the first bite without the chip just to savor the flavors.  The bass ceviche is also quite good but leans a little heavy into the cucumber for my taste.  And that grilled octopus?  Perfect and a very nice sized portion.For our entree, we went with the lamb barbacoa which was delicious served with corn tortillas (they have three kinds of these, herb, beer and turmeric flavored) and the pork belly tacos.  A wonderful explosion of flavors in both of these dishes.Our server let us know that later in the evening a DJ comes in and we should stop back for a drink . . .so we did.  And while the drinks were good and well poured, I doubt I would make this a late night spot but it was really too new to tell how this aspect of the bar will do given there are other clubs nearby.If you drive- they have valet parking for $10 out front but know that you can usually find free parking in and around the side streets in Fulton Market.  Dinner with plenty of drinks came to about $140 for two.Creative name for a creative place for food, drink and ambiance!  Check it out!"
taqueria-tayahua-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-tayahua-chicago,02/24/13 , 5 ," Checked in after a visit to 26th, thought we&#39;d try a local favorite. Fairly empty around 12:30 p.m., not usually a good sign. Greeted immediately and seated without wait. Without question, the chips sucked. Mostly stale and cold; greasy too. Salsa was decent, and helped with the less than appetizing fried tortillas. Fortunately, lunch was to the contrary. Veggie tacos were the tops, packed with avocado and all the trimmings. My buddy&#39;s steak torta was massive, and one of the better he&#39;s consumed. The rice and beans were a crowd pleaser as well. Menu is fairly extensive, fitting for the most diverse palate; a hard task in the taqueria world. Prices were market with plenty of daily specials.Tayahua got off to a rough start, they finished near the front by the end of the race. Worth a second try in my book. We&#39;ll be back..."

farmers-fridge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmers-fridge-chicago,11/12/14 , 5 ," They call it a kiosk, but that&#39;s the same thing as a janitor being referred to as a custodial technician. It&#39;s a fluff word for vending machine and no matter how good the salad might be your customer service is still coming from a robot instead of a real person. To me there&#39;s no substitute.That being said, if you told me before yesterday that I&#39;d ever enjoy eating a full meal from something that could potentially be a transformer I&#39;d call you crazy. The greens are pretty good though. They&#39;re served in jars and similar to the old Mac Deezy&#39;s marketing ploybuzzfeed.com/briangalind…(#6) are easy to take to go and distribute dressing all over each bite.Overall it&#39;s a great idea if you&#39;ve got to eat your lunch on the L, but for a fresh made meal there&#39;s other options in this food court that I think are better."

Paid two separate visits to Woodhaven within a few weeks because of an event.Woodhaven is well hidden as I don&#39;t recall seeing an obvious sign. The interior is dark with a rustic touch. Our group arrived at 6:30PM and the place was particularly empty even though it was a Friday night. We ordered our drinks and food but it took them so long to serve that I was convinced they had forgotten about us. The orders were eventually served and we tried the chicken fries, sliders, and tater tots. They were pretty standard bar food for about $6 each. I also really enjoyed the drink of the night which was a mix of iced tea and vodka."

So we decided to stop here for breakfast.We sat at the counter and it was a few minutes before anyone greeted us to take our order. It seemed like there was a lag time between greeting us, giving us water, etc but they were busy so I guess I will give them a pass.I got the Ultimate Meat Skillet - holy cow there was a lot of food! It came with a choice of toast or pancakes and I picked pancakes....bad choice for me because my eyes are bigger than my stomach. There was probably enough food to feed at least 2 people. My husband got biscuit &amp; gravy and he said that he got more biscuits than he expected - he scarfed them down like there was no tomorrow.I would go back again...for sure!"
owen-and-engine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/owen-and-engine-chicago,05/29/14 , 5 ," Since I&#39;ve just written up one five-star ampersand restaurant--Longman &amp; Eagle, natch--why not double down? Here it goes, with Owen &amp; Engine.I&#39;d been told that title rights to the best burger in Chicago belonged to Owen &amp; Engine. After a detailed fact-finding expedition, I&#39;m ready to award my belt. It goes not to the fine folks at O&amp;E, but instead to the divine burger produced by Au Cheval.That said, Owen &amp; Engine takes home the silver thus far, and not insignificant award considering my burger standards. One, I love me the thin patty. If I want a hunk of beef, I&#39;ll grab a steak. My personal opinion: thick patties sacrifice flavor for juiciness, and walk a fine line at producing said juiciness at that. Owen &amp; Engine&#39;s pub burger goes thick.It&#39;s a fine thick burger, though, and I like it above the legend that is Kuma&#39;s. There&#39;s more juice and more flavor at O&amp;E. Sure, Kuma&#39;s gives you virtually unlimited freedom to top, but that&#39;s like adding barbeque sauce and baked beans to your simplistic yet perfect brisket. It&#39;s about the meat, and O&amp;E does it better.There&#39;s plenty else on the menu other than just a burger, though. Start with the delectable malt vinegar aioli that accompanies the burger&#39;s fries or the fish and chips order that the wife picked. There&#39;s more British pub and general upscale bar favorites too--see the scotch egg or the locally sourced charcuterie board that Yelp&#39;s reviewers have chosen to feature. And no, I didn&#39;t try the bone marrow, but a second glance at that uni butter is making my mouth water.Ah, and the cherry on top: tea time is available, with homemade scones to boot. That&#39;s a wife-pleaser for sure. Also, fun fact: a blueberry scone tastes great with bourbon. It&#39;s science."

Great selections of wines and small bites.We ordered the shrimp avocado and the parma crostinis as well as the prosciutto and arugula rustic pizza, and to finish a slice of tiramisu, all I can say is that everything was well presented and delicious. Our server David, was super attentive also.I was a bit biased at first due to the location, but left impressed, glad I came, definitely coming back."
brown-bag-seafood-co-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brown-bag-seafood-co-chicago-4,07/25/14 , 5 ," There are so many mixed reviews about this new kid on the block, I didn&#39;t know what to expect walking in for lunch today! At first, it can be confusing - as in, where do I go? What do I do? Luckily, an employee walked over and explained the system to us. Once we reached the &#34;station&#34; where you write out your order, there was another employee to help with questions and recommendations. And they were actually helpful ones, like which options are the most substantial amount of food if you&#39;re hungry (which I was, because I always am).He pointed me in the direction of the powerbox, and I chose the blackened fish of the day for it - Halibut. Also had to try a side, and while everyone I was with went tot style, I settled on the intriguing sounding spicy peanut cilantro slaw. Both choices were great! I would definitely get them again. The key is to eat the powerbox with a little spinach, quinoa, and fish in each bite. The way they stack it in the box, you may be tempted to just dig in to whatever is on top but trust me on this one - the flavors and textures are meant to be together in one heaping delicious bite :)"
joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,09/08/14 , 5 ," Joy Yee&#39;s makes for a pretty fascinating psychological study. It&#39;s authentic enough to draw in foreigners who might not want to walk the gritty streets of Chinatown and have to order solely by pointing at pictures on a menu. It&#39;s cheap enough for people like my dad to eat there and comment for the rest of the night how great it was, even though we both know that he&#39;s really talking about the bill. Yet, because it&#39;s an amalgamation of 3-4 different ethnic cafeterias, you don&#39;t hold it to a very high esteem, which is actually great for Joy Yee&#39;s because you taste the food and it reminds you enough of what you&#39;ve had elsewhere, and then you&#39;re pleasantly pleased and stuffed. Joy Yee&#39;s has exceeded your expectations because your mind already set very attainable ones before you ordered. Make sense?My friend and I ordered the Green Curry w/ Chicken and the Basil Pork, both of which were actually quite good. the Green Curry was this synthetic-green color, but it tasted pretty alright. Just close your eyes, I say."

cellars-market-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cellars-market-chicago,05/15/14 , 5 ," I found this gem a few months ago and come here several times a month. It basically is a huge cafeteria, but the food items I&#39;ve tried are really delicious and filling, so I keep coming back. They have a salad bar, soups, a place for entrees, personal pizzas, sandwiches, burgers and now bbq/mexican.I&#39;ve tried their rigatoni chicken, chicken parmigiana, and their chicken burrito (never knew I got everything chicken). The burrito is amazing and they LOAD you on the chicken, good luck staying hungry after that beast. I like it better than Chipotle because they don&#39;t lather on sour cream - also ask for jalapenos in your burrito. The rigatoni chicken is very juicy and filling, feels like a home made cooked meal. I still have other things to try, but the service is pretty quick and the food is great.Update Feb 2015: They renovated the place and added some new selections. I had their shredded chicken sandwich w/ mac &amp; cheese, it was pretty good. They cut the beef brisket in front of you, so you know its fresh. Stop by this place if you work in the loop, you won&#39;t regret it.All this being said - if you&#39;re touring Chicago, try some other place since this doesn&#39;t scream Chicago."

Kind of a more approachable place than honey butter fried chicken. (Yes, I said it). Try the catfish po boy sandwich with remulaude sauce. So good. Especially try the collard greens as a side and its a great meal. We also tried the fried chicken sandwich and pulled pork. I liked the pulled pork better but the chicken was really juicy. Ask for the homemade honey mustard and it&#39;s even better.Place is small but just enough seating for a big group. Atmosphere is cool...very old school blues and bbq joint style.  Service is fast and very friendly that it makes you want to stay a while.End the meal with a great carrot cake that everyone enjoyed.

Wahla - I found this beautiful eatery.I caught them just at the tail end of the lunch rush but they were moving the line quickly. I grabbed a beef shwarma sandwich with some falafel and was quite happy with my choice. The shwarma sandwich had just enough meat to make me one happy camper. The falafel was as expected, which means it was equally amazing.I know I&#39;ll definitely be back if I&#39;m in the area. Thing to note: there are tables but they seem to specialize in takeout for the business crowd. Be prepared to wait for a table or a spot along the window."

I mean, it is thanksgiving, after all. friendly service, hot sake and hot miso brought out in the first 3 min of my escape from the nippy 25 deg weather outside brrrrr. I&#39;m missing that 85 dev heat at home right about now.The rest of the food was ick.  Summer roll made me wish I had stopped by a grocery store n picked up sushi. And, no, I&#39;m not talking about whole foods sushi, I&#39;m talking Ralph&#39;s sushi woulda been better.  The description sounded good: yellowtail cilantro jalenpenos: nope, there&#39;s no kick in that roll. Ditto on the sashimi.,,.... Tho I don&#39;t know if Ralph&#39;s sells sashimi HahaaThe pink ginger shoulda been a red flag. Damn hunger pains clearly impacted my judgement.I&#39;m gonna assume that all the high reviews are ppl eating the cooked rolls. There&#39;s simply no other explanation.... And the ambience??! What ambiance??? It looks and feels like a poorly put together ikea set in an out house. I don&#39;t get it. Well, the music was good. Sam smith fixes everything... The sake didn&#39;t hurt either ;P"
moxee-restaurant-and-mad-mouse-brewing-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/moxee-restaurant-and-mad-mouse-brewing-chicago,08/04/14 , 5 ," A couple weeks back... (I know they&#39;re new but there&#39;s no running from the &#34;meh&#34; burger)Excellent first impression: I walk in and marvel at the large space. A server pops over and tells me to sit anywhere that I want, so I chose a high top next to the window where the beer&#39;s brewed. She hands me a menu and even offers that I could probably get a tour. &#34;Great!&#34;When she returns, I&#39;d remark how clean it all is in there and she replies, &#34;That&#39;s because we don&#39;t brew here yet.&#34;I&#39;m thinking, &#34;huh?&#34; and I&#39;m wondering &#34;So I guess there&#39;s no tour.&#34;So I say, &#34;Do you know when they&#39;re starting up here?&#34;SIDENOTE: I&#39;m not the mistress of &#34;perfectly reasonable questions,&#34; but here, I thought I was being sensible. The reply,&#34;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not the brewmaster.&#34;So, who knows? Did she get scolded by someone in back for offering a tour? Anyway, a different server came to take my order.I had the burger with bleu cheese and I can&#39;t say that I run into many &#34;icky&#34; burgers, but here it was. The patty was pre-formed meat (like pulled from frozen? I don&#39;t know but it had that feel about it) and tasteless. The bun was great, but that&#39;s about it.Two stars all the way - especially when this other server runs my card and tells me &#34;it&#39;s declined.&#34; So, I offer a different card and pop on the phone with my card company to hear, &#34;No, we haven&#39;t declined any transactions.&#34; When she returned with the card that &#34;did work&#34; I asked her if she realized that they didn&#39;t accept the other card. &#34;I don&#39;t really know.&#34;I really know...two stars."

I&#39;m not sure why they are empty because they food here is quite good. You can tell the chef has a deep passion for food and his work by the way presentation. For $35 you get like a 4 or 5 course meal. I honestly liked all of them. Unfortunately, it&#39;s been a few months since I&#39;ve gone there so I don&#39;t remember the names of the food I ordered. Nonetheless, I will definitely go back."
rajun-cajun-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rajun-cajun-chicago,07/26/12 , 5 ," The color inside Rajun Cajun, which results from the combination of pink neon lighting with neon yellow painted walls, probably doesn&#39;t exist anywhere else in the world. And neither does the combination of Southern soul food (fried chicken, corn muffins, sweet potatoes) with curries and mango lassis and tandoori chicken.From the minute you step through the door and stand basking in Rajun Cajun&#39;s electric orange glow, you are greeted with the rich smells of spices and curries mixed with burning incense, usually a Bollywood movie or something else playing on the television, Indian music, and the smiling friendly faces of the owners (who are there to serve their customers every single day).This place is one of my favorite places to eat in Hyde Park, not only because the food is consistently absolutely delicious (my favorites include the butter chicken and paneer), but also because it delivers a kind of escape-- from the noise of 53rd Street, from standard American fast food, from the cold in winter. Just stepping in here during February when the whole world seems cold and gray will make you feel warmer.I&#39;m moving away from Chicago soon, and Rajun Cajun is one of the places I will miss the most! I hope I get to come back."

I like the fact that they list the calories for everything on the menu (for those that may track their calorie intake). Also, the employees working here were all friendly, which made dining here even more enjoyable.

bacchanalia-ristorante-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bacchanalia-ristorante-chicago-2,07/09/13 , 5 ," Rock solid Italian food.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s from the middle of the country and by the sea as  there are several seafood choices, and the food is not as &#34;refined&#34; as northern Italian nor uses as much red sauce as southern Italian food.  Result is large portions of fresh, delicious, savory fare from an interesting menu with lots of classic old school favorites for the not so adventurous.Any dish with the name house name &#34;Bacchanalia&#34; in it, is outstanding, which is good because the portions are so large you will be eating them for three days.  I thought the non-red sauce dishes were better than the red sauce dishes as the sauce was a little acidic. Southern Italians put a little sugar in the sauce to sweeten it so maybe its a regional difference so be prepared for it.  Still very good.The staff are delightful, friendly and professional.  Prices are very reasonable for the portions you receive. We were a party of 7 and ordered an appetizer that came in a portion of six so they threw an extra piece on the dish.. that&#39;s a class act!Come hungry and enjoy."

And understandably so since campus lunch options nearby don&#39;t have the healthiest options really, and this place having tasty kale salads and quinoa bowls it is good brain food for anyone needing a break from work on campus!I got their quinoa bowl with a tomato curry sauce and you can tell that everything was really fresh. Their pies are also super popular and they often run out I&#39;ve been told, so go earlier on in the day if that is something that you want. I definitely need to come back and try and their steak and ale pie (and then hopefully split that with someone who wants the kale salad with citrus and quinoa to try and make it a little healthier ha ha) But for the area, if you can find a spot sit here, they have great coffee drinks and such, and yes it is a little pricey, but hipster food land always is :-)"

I ordered online via GrubHub - I think theirs was a sponsored link. The delivery all the way down to where I live took a LONG time (more than 40 minutes after I was notified by GH that my food was out for delivery); I think that may have been a part of the issue in terms of food quality. Maybe they should not deliver to places that are too far from their location?Good:The hummus was goodDill rice were goodNot:Falafel - dryPita Bread - dry, stuck, brokenI paid for extra bread, but I don&#39;t know if it was provided. I know with a falafel plate and large hummus, I ran out of it. They did provide a two mini-containers each of tahini and hot sauce."
balena-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/balena-chicago,08/23/14 , 5 ," Second trip here, similar sentiments.  Great selection of cocktails and wine.  They also offer a refreshing lemon soda from Almafi, which is the same one sold at Eataly.  The table had a jar of peppery thin breadsticks that were nice and crispy.  We started with the Burrata di Panna, which is the most popular appetizer per our server.  It was so creamy and delicious; however, the cheese to whole wheat cracker ratio was definitely large.  I was disappointed it only came with 4 crackers.We split the Cacio e Pepe and Rigatoni pastas.  The cacio e pepe was good, but I&#39;ve had better.  At least it was al dente.  The rigatoni was overcooked.  We also split the Grilled Prawns, which is meant to be an entree for one so we added the side of glazed carrots at the recommendation of our server.  The prawn heads were crispy and seasoned well.  The side was a generous portion of carrots of different colors and shapes.  We had the pizza the first time around, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable.  The food was presented very nicely.I really wanted to try the Chocolate and Hazelnut Croccante, which the server described as a &#34;grown up Kit Kat bar&#34;, but was too stuffed for dessert.  She offered to have that or the Tiramisu to go, so that&#39;s definitely an option in the future.Overall, nice ambiance and a great place to grab a cocktail and share a few plates before heading over to the theater or shopping on North Ave.  The food itself was just okay."

The old Takoz from Taylor street has been reborn in a new location and a new taste of flavor.I believe you are really going to love the prices at the new location as well as the flavorful morsels of Mexican fare. The spices in food that we all missed for almost a year has returned to take it spot amongst the ever rivaling Mexican cuisine that has landed on Taylor street in the last few years. With the closing of Joe&#39;s and other spots, it is a very good landing in its new renovated spot.I think this time the restaurant has given itself a new life and a new outlook on what it considers to be REALLY GREAT MEXICAN FOOD,just how an abuela (grandma) would do in her own kitchen in off road site some-were in Mexico.Thank you for coming back and giving us probably the best Nachos with cheese and meat Taylor Street has witnessed.Burritos of charbroiled skirt steak rival the best ones on 26th street or in Pilsen. This time, the resurrection of a staple on Taylor is staying, and we are SO happy it has become the Phoenix in Little Italy."
mista-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mista-chicago,12/15/14 , 5 ," I quite enjoyed the food here, but I think it&#39;s a little expensive for what it is.Most pizzas will run you approximately 15 or so dollars for a 10&#34;, which I guess is owing to the fact that most of their ingredients are organic - so if you&#39;re willing to pay for that, this is the place for you. The crust is super thin - like a cracker - so it&#39;s not very substantial, and if you have a big appetite you&#39;ll probably leave feeling hungry. I had the prosciutto pizza, which I enjoyed, though I wish the cheese had been melted a bit more - it was fresh mozzarella, so it was on top of the pizza in lumps rather than spread out. Prosciutto itself was nice, and it was the perfect serving size for me (keeping in mind that I don&#39;t eat very large meals), just too expensive ($15) for how little *stuff* there actually was on the plate.It&#39;s pretty close to where I live, so I wouldn&#39;t rule out coming back - I&#39;m just not scrambling to plan my next trip.Also, there&#39;s an extra charge to use your credit card for orders under $10, which is both baffling and not actually a problem given that pretty much everything on the menu costs more than that. But the whole charging for credit card usage thing. What is this, 1997?"

ge-pa-de-caffe-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ge-pa-de-caffe-chicago-3,12/29/14 , 5 ," I had a mixed experience here.I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, nutella latte, and two scoops of (what was initially) hazelnut and raspberry. Let the story begin.I thought the sandwich wasn&#39;t anything special. Would&#39;ve preferred a stronger taste of pesto, and definitely could&#39;ve done WITHOUT the pickles. Thought they were too jarringly sour and didn&#39;t mix well with the rest of the sandwich.The nutella latte was sublime, and I was sad I only got two gulps of it before my partner finished the rest.Then comes the gelato. I had super high expectations and hopes for this as I read rave Yelp reviews on the owner&#39;s magic with his self-made gelato. The waitress was accommodating enough to put up with my many requests (around 5) to try different flavors. They were all good in those little samplers. I ordered a double scoop of hazelnut and raspberry (mixed with white chocolate and I forgot what else), and was super excited to devour it. It was embellished with two cookies on top. BUT THEN I FOUND A STRAND OF HAIR! Mind you, I always come across these back home in Thailand where people don&#39;t really care, but I expected better from an American establishment. I would&#39;ve carried on eating the gelato anyway after taking out the hair, only to realize it was really long and was lodged deep within my gelato. Lol.I went to the counter - I wasn&#39;t upset at all at this point, merely wanted it replaced - and encountered no problems with my request. However, when I received the replaced gelato the same waitress had given me pistachio instead of hazelnut, which my partner and I hadn&#39;t really liked during the samplers. This didn&#39;t go well with the raspberry, which made the combination too sweet for us. She also did not care to apologize or say a word when handing me the second gelato replacement.The only redeeming part of the gelato experience was that the other waitress behind the counter personally came over to our table to fully refund our gelato order in cash. She was great.I would still give this place another chance because of its nutella latte and drop in for a gelato, though."

The surrounding neighborhood is pretty rough, so I would recommend driving over to the restaurant. (We took the 4 bus here and walked two blocks -- have never seem my friend walk so fast in my life. Ended up uber-ing it back).They were filming for some sort of TV show or movie when we arrived, which was pretty cool.The service here is great -- we ordered two sets of 10 pc wings (garlic parm, honey bbq, banging spicy, and jalapeno). The honey bbq one was my favorite. The spicy had a real kick to it. All the wings I had were very delicious and flavorful. I would definitely recommend getting two contrasting flavors (e.g. one sweet, one spicy) to get a fuller experience here.While we were waiting for our wings, one of the workers here brought us out a cup of grapes lightly coated with peanuts and caramel. This gesture was very much appreciated! These little fellows were delish! If they are on the menu, you have to try them.Service is great here so this wasn&#39;t really a problem for us, but I can imagine that during busier hours it would be useful to have a napkin dispenser on each table since the wings are so messy."
blackwood-bbq-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago-4,12/10/14 , 5 ," Plenty to like, but some stingy practices prevent it from being 5 stars.Positives:Delicious brisket and the ability to choose lean, normal or fatty is great. Delicious pepper and smoke flavor, tender meat and a good pairing with the KC sauce (spicy). The cornbread was a good texture, not overly moist but enough that it wasn&#39;t breaking apart.Negatives:Weighing the meat. Good for the accountant, and while I didn&#39;t think I was underserved by any means, it doesn&#39;t give you a good impression as mentioned in other reviews. I don&#39;t like that the sauce is only on the line and not available at the table or at least by the fountain. I like drenching my sides in sauce or trying different ones with each bite.I&#39;d definitely come back, but will probably continue trying new places before making a second trip."

It&#39;s just different, though. Cold vs. toasted sandwiches...Anyway, the meat quality here is fabulous. I usually get the turkey -- thinly sliced layers of turkey with tomatoes and lettuce on soft, chewy bread. It&#39;s phenomenal. Make sure to get some crunchy chips with it to balance out the textures. For those of you who know me, I do love my balanced textures and flavors. You gotta have the crunchy with the soft and chewy, as well as the spicy with the salty, savory. Or whatever else balanced each other out. A lot of my coworkers (I work at UIC down the block) love the meatball sandwich as well. If you&#39;re in the mood for a hot sandwich, definitely try that one."

The chef is Paul Virant, and &#34;perennial&#34; refers to the seasonally changing menu.We sat at the bar at what turned out to be a slow weekday night, which turned out to be awesome for us.An in-training bartender named Drew originally started serving us, but when we started asking questions about liqueurs in the cocktails, as he tried to explain them, the more experienced Wesley jumped in and poured us little tastes -- a taste is worth a thousand words. From there, Wesley took over, answering our questions about their homemade pickles and charcuterie, and what farm they get their local produce from --- an indoor greenhouse in a huge warehouse in Chicago ran by at-risk youth.  He was personable, knowledgeable, and damn can he shake a drink. He&#39;s an awesome bartender and he knew everything about the food as well! Best service ever, thanks Wesley, you made our night!!!The Good:Everything! Food! Service! Drinks! Ambiance! Seasonal menu! Homemade pickles! Local vegetables! They have beer, they have cocktails, they have beer cocktails! All their creative and unique drinks were tasty -- and we tried a few ;) ALL our food was delicious and amazing. Awesome professional yet personable service from our hilarious &amp; knowledgeable bartender Wesley. We&#39;d go back constantly if we lived in Chicago! I loved the ambiance -- the restaurant was clean and modern, classy but unpretentious. There were even couches (classy ones obviously) in one corner. One of those places you feel cool just sitting there.The Bad:the fact that we don&#39;t live in Chicago and can&#39;t go here all the time!The Food:Everything was incredible from salads to homemade chocolate chip cookies. Worst thing (and it&#39;s not that bad) was the homemade gnocchi dish, which was tasty but just super heavy for spring. When we ordered it, Wesley suggested another, lighter dish, so we got them both -- and he was very right! Perfect service -- instead of saying &#34;oh that&#39;s not that good&#34; or &#34;get this instead&#34; (or nothing at all) when he knew one dish was better than the one we ordered, he just offered a relevant opinion, and we ended up getting both dishes and really appreciating his input!The Service:Amazing, awesome, honest, hilarious, fun and professional service from our Chicago-native bartender Wesley. At one point he said &#34;there&#39;s a red Power Ranger running down the street -- just so we all saw that&#34; -- we turned around and there was in fact a guy in a red Power Ranger outfit (uniform?) running down the street. A special moment. The memories we made.Overall:Amazing, wonderful, unforgettable experience! So much fun, so many tasty drinks, so many delicious seasonal local fresh dishes!Pro tip: (applies to most restaurants but especially Perennial) Instead of sitting at a table, ordering entrees and leaving, sit at the bar -- you can usually order food there, and it&#39;s way more fun, relaxed and interactive. Get appetizers, share them, talk to the bartender, ask questions, taste stuff, enjoy yourself! And if you&#39;re at Perennial -- cross your fingers Wesley&#39;s working!"
bricks-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bricks-chicago,11/05/14 , 5 ," We are staying at Hotel Lincoln and arrived fairly late on a Tuesday evening.  The excellent bellhop Joseph recommended that we walk the few blocks to Bricks.  Excellent suggestion!Our group of eight enjoyed the rather unique and interesting atmosphere.  It was cozy but comfortable and the server quickly pushed several tables together to accommodate our group.  We all ordered different pizzas from the wide selection of unique house pizzas.  Beware! The pizzas are served extremely hot so give them a few minutes to cool.My first love is deep dish, especially in Chicago but this was some of the best thin crust pizza I have ever had.  There were several vegetarian specialities on the menu, almost too many to choose from at least at the late hour of our arrival.  I finally settled on the Popeye and it was excellent.The beer menu is HUGE and there are various beer and wine specials on different days of the week.Highly recommend if you are in the area.....or even if you aren&#39;t it is worth a drive."

But this gentleman has and I&#39;m grateful to him for it. What an awesome combo!

naansense-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naansense-chicago,09/11/14 , 5 ," I absolutely love this place more than the place they replaced! What was the name of that place???? I don&#39;t remember and I don&#39;t care. The food was similar, but Nannsense wins by far.I wanted to be healthy and grab a salad, but since I know their known for the chicken naanwich I had to go with that. So glad I did! The chicken is season well and tender, ingredients are fresh, and the makhani sauce ties everything together.Since I&#39;m on a healthy streak I figured why not try the spiced fries. Ummmmm.....DELICIOUS! Definitely not spicy, but the flavor is far from the norm and I like the soft texture (not a fan of crunchy fries). The weird yellow dipping sauce for the fries wasn&#39;t that good, but to me anything beats ketchup so there still winning! Meal came to around $10 but the quality and portion size of the food made it worthwhile. I can&#39;t wait to try more of the menu.More of a takeout spot. Table seating is limited. If you go during off peak hours you can possibly snag a table, but prime time one is hard to come by."

While Jupiter is in no position to knock Nhu Lan off of my banh mi pedestal, I have to give them serious propers for coming out of left field to deliver a banh mi sandwich that was substantial, tasty and filling. Was it the best I have had? No. Was it tasty? Yes. I might need to try one again, so as to get the true taste of the thing. Truly, I was so shocked to be eating a banh mi from Jupiter that my mind might have been a little, uh, off-kilter.Why all the shock? Because, up until that experience, I knew Jupiter for decent coffee, ridiculously good cookies and alternatingly indifferent-to-chilly service. A couple of the employees are masters of the side-eye brush off. For real. I have almost had a &#39;moment&#39; there a couple of different times, but I now know to get in and get out and limit my time with them lest I be forced to say and do something that might cause harm... back. But, this section of Fulton is more populated with rolling tumbleweed than businesses open to the public, so coffee with &#39;tude is better than no coffee at all. But, that banh mi. Interesting. I might need to re-think this Jupiter Outpost thing."

I&#39;ve passed this a number of times, so this was time to actually stop in and try it.This is not a five star restaurant. They have a fairly large menu replete with burgers, dogs and fries of all different types. I chose the New York Street Dog - a great steamed hot dog in natural casing with sour kraut, grilled onions and spicy mustard. I also tried their fries. They fresh cut them and fry them crisp (the way I like them). Many of their dogs offer something called devil sauce, so I asked for some on the side. I would guess it is a mixture of ketchup, mayo and taco spices. It is quite tangy and has a nice burn. It was great on the fries.While there, I read an interesting review they had posted on their wall. It absolutely raved about their burgers. Next time I&#39;ll give them a try. I thought about getting one after finishing my dog, but I was just too full.Good, quick and the right price."

So, we ate inside where there were few people with so I felt like we were forgotten at times. The server seemed kind of disinterested and the woman who was bussing and served us water also didn&#39;t seem like she wanted to be bothered. But the food is high quality.I had the beet salad and loved it. When I didn&#39;t like my first choice dinner, they brought out an alternate right away and were very understanding.The desserts were spectacular. I had the tiramisu and tasted the cannolli. Good stuff!"

If you ain&#39;t scurred of the meat sweats though you&#39;ll be in hog heaven deciding between the Bacon Bomb, Bacon Grenades, or any other explosions of swine.Can&#39;t do the candy of meats? There&#39;s still a couple of things safe for your stomach here. And even if you don&#39;t eat you&#39;ll still love the vast beer selection, killer outdoor patio, and friendly neighborhood service.Overall a pretty awesome new addition at the end of Randolph that should make even the hipsters at Pitchfork happy this weekend."

I&#39;ve been here with friends, family and even hosted my hubby&#39;s surprise 30th bday party. For the party, the staff let me bring a cake beforehand, decorate the table with corny bday crap and when his fam rolled up with coolers to BYOB (which is why I love them), they didn&#39;t even bat an eye.Their food is phenomenal. Something that stands out here is the gobi manchurian which I always get. It tastes like calamari but it&#39;s cauliflower. How the f? I&#39;ve had the samosas, naan, roti, tikka, the kofta which were all excellent. Recently I said yolo and tried the navratan korma, which was sweet and peanuty and a beautiful break from spicy food when you need it. Hubby loves the lamb korma and pretty much every lamb dish here. Every time I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve shut the place down and they&#39;ve never said a thing. Truly the nicest staff ever!I love Rangoli forever ever."

Play to your strengths and that&#39;s what they do. The specialty burgers here are seasoned well and this summer I hope to run a train on their menu from the burgers to the fries to the spiked shakes.For starters I had the House of the Rising Sun that comes with a fried egg naturally. I guess my only beef would be that it didn&#39;t come topped with lettuce and tomato. No matter the specialty I feel all burgers should come with that. The sriacha pickles are damn good as well. I only got the regular house fries but I&#39;m sold on the pico and pork belly versions too. I see you summer.To make the visit that much more pleasant I was given a free drink by the lady at the register. And she was excited just because I was excited to be there for the first time haha. Service was on point and can get slow but I could tell the workers keep a close eye.The space is decorated pretty dope with rock memorabilia but again it&#39;s small. I don&#39;t like the feeling and act of battling and eyeing down tables with other patrons cause I promise you I will get to it first, nice guy or not.I know a second location just spawned and I&#39;m curious as to the size but either way this menu has no chance with me."

IT WAS ABOUT TIME to brunch outdoors in the lovely Lincoln Park!Dunlays had a great selection of brunch items, and their weekend brunch runs Saturdays and Sundays from 10am - 3pm.  I had no idea that Dunlays had such a lovely brunch menu.  It&#39;s on the corner of Wrightwood and Clark, semi-busy, but the outdoor seating area is on the quieter street (Wrightwood) but you can still people watch, but you&#39;re not directly next to traffic.The area was roomy, comfortable and the servers were attentive and nice.  I brought my dog, who hung out under our seats and table, and one of the servers even went to get a treat to give to my pup.  Really sweet of her.Anyways, between four people, here is what we ordered:1) Housemade Monkey Bread2) Strange Daze Omlette3) Oatmeal Pancakes with Maple Butter4)  Corned Beef HashTWO out of the FOUR dishes = phenom:The Housemade Monkey Bread itself gets 5 stars.  Imagine a warm, golden (duo of) gooey &amp; crusty cake that is smothered in rich frosting.. a bazillion times better than Cinnabon.  And I already love Cinnabon that much!The Corned Beef Hash was also great (5 stars).  It was the essence of a &#34;meat and potatoes&#34; dish, with chunks of hearty corned beef.. and NOT the canned kind!  The pepper sauce had a kick and just the right amount of spiciness.  Both these dishes were served on iron skillets that came out piping hot, so I think it&#39;s safe to say anything that is served in their skillets is most likely going to be phenomenally delicious.The Strange Daze Omlette was standard (it came with a side of hash browns) and the Oatmeal Pancakes were standard as well.  All portions are large enough to be shareable.  And their coffee is intelligentsia.Now that the weather is warming up... head on out to as many outdoor brunch places as possible!  Especially Dunlays on Clark for mid-day brunch bliss and next time I&#39;ll order a bloody mary."

I should have went with more of a traditional Italian dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Veal Braciole Platter which is Meatball, sausage, veal braciole, all simmered in homemade marinara.  He was also disappointed, and both of these dishes were top recommendations by our server... another disappointment.  We also ordered the Zucchini &amp; Calamari Combo - 1/2 zucchini, 1/2 calamari, which is pretty hard to mess up.  It was decent.  The bread and red sauce is great here but when we asked for another basket the server kind of gave us a weird look like we were obese people eating too much.For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake with really good banana fudge gelato.  Afer we demolished this dish, the server ask if we would like some bread to soak up the rest of the dish.  WTF!?  If he was trying to be funny, he wasn&#39;t... in fact it was just rude and annoying.I will not be back."

The margs are good but a bit small for my taste (since places like El Cid are serving them up cheap and BIG), but tasty nonetheless.  Beer is reasonable and there&#39;s domestics and imports, so go crazy.Apps were delish and clearly all made in-house.  I appreciate an establishment that isn&#39;t warming frozen meals but rather making all of the food on-site.  We had some empanadas, small salads and yummy entrees.  I chose to err on the side of vegetarian and all of my choices were yummy.  If offered the option, get the steamed cactus as your side - you won&#39;t regret it!  Their menu is fairly large, there&#39;s steak, chicken, seafood and veggie options and the plates are a nice size.  Prices are reasonable and the food is so good you likely won&#39;t have room for dessert (we didn&#39;t).Parking is abundant on North Ave. and they&#39;re not too busy on weeknights, so stop on in for a quick meal.  The atmosphere is nice, a bit romantic if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for and the music is nice.  Staff was very friendly and always around when we needed a drink refill."

It was around 11pm so the waitress did not look too happy to see us. Oh well. There were a few people at the bar and a few others came in while we were eating.I was famished so I got a mushroom burger which came with homemade chips. The food was good. Of course I was starving so may have been biased, but my friend likes this place.Funny: my friend spotted chocolate chip cream cheese on the salad bar that she just had to try. So she asked the grumpy waitress if she could have some which we got. I don&#39;t why she was so excited to try this, but she was. I have to say it was weird, but actually pretty tasty. Mostly it was just hilarious though.I&#39;d say if you are looking for a burger and a beer this is a pretty good place. Nothing outrageously outstanding, but it&#39;s good. They do have chocolate chip cream cheese though so there&#39;s that....."

Stopped in around 10am and grabbed a seat in what can virtually be described as a shack with a kitchen . Only about 10 seats inside...but man was it worth it. Tried their Media Noche Sandwich (a Friday Special) as opposed to their Cuban. Fortunately it was a near mirror image and worth every red cent! Tender pork and ham, pickles, plenty of Swiss cheese, and mustard topped off the dish perfectly. Their egg bread was similar to you&#39;re more often seen Hawaiian style bread. A side of maraquitas was icing on the cake! It&#39;s understandable the hype, and no doubt one of the best Cuban sandwiches in the city. Now I&#39;m looking to check out their other location, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just as great."

They will also serve any part of the goat that you&#39;d like, including &#34;inners&#34;. Plus, fresh corn tortillas made in house.Prices are a little higher than your typical Mexican joint worth it. My only issue with the amount of fat and gristle they serve with the meat.

It&#39;s just your regular old corner bar with great food, super friendly service, and some sidewalk seating for when weather permits.There&#39;s a good sized beer list with some great local flavors as well as imports. The food menu boasts bangers (sausage sandos) and grinders (open-faced sandos) that will knock your socks off and the jukebox always seems to be playing something that&#39;ll make you say, &#34;Damn...this is a great song!&#34;Overall Aberdeen gets an A+ as far as I&#39;m concerned."
zenwich-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zenwich-chicago,12/19/14 , 5 ," Zenwich recently opened on Van Buren near my office, in the space formerly occupied by Burrito Buggy.  Zenwich features Asian-fusion sandwiches, with several veggie, vegan and gluten free options.  My bud and I wandered in around noon, and there was a big crowd waiting for their orders.  However the ordering line was rather short, and we placed our orders not long after entering.  Our lunch orders were brought out to us within ten minutes, so that&#39;s not too bad considering the lunchtime crowd.  We ate at these high butcher block tabletops along the window, so I supposed you can eat sitting or standing if you dine in.Their signature Zenwiches come with a side of homemade chips and pickle spear.  My bud and I ordered two different sandwiches to share, and fortunately they are cut in half to facilitate eating.  The Mu Ping, seemingly their most notable selection, is stuffed with grilled cuts of caramelized pork, a heap of finely cut veggies (carrot, daikon, cucumber, red onion, jalapeno, cilantro) and tangy sweet aioli.  The Korean cheese steak is filled with chunks of grilled soy marinated steak, grilled onion, green onion, mushroom, and smoked gouda cheese.  The Mu Ping is good, with a level of spiciness (from the jalapeno, and possibly the somewhat runny aioli sauce) that seemed to build from bite to bite.  I really liked the flavorful Korean cheese steak.  It is more of a cousin to a standard Philly cheesesteak and not an identical twin, but definitely delicious.  My bud also enjoyed his fruity Yuzu lemonade.  There are lots of good lunch options in this corner of downtown, and Zenwich has shoehorned itself to become a new tasty spot as well."
señor-pan-cafe-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/se%C3%B1or-pan-cafe-chicago-4,12/23/14 , 5 , It&#39;s pretty sad that lately I have not been impressed with their sandwiches or the cafe con leche. They just changed the bread they use for the sandwiches so now I feel like they taste different and not in a good way. The cafe con leche has just been  &#34;blah&#34; as well with no real taste. Sucks that they pre-make the cafe con leche and just keep it in a carafe there unlike before where they used to make it for you on the spot when you order it.Might have to start to look for a new Cuban sandwich place in the area since I&#39;m pretty sure there have to be other places....sad day for me!

It didn&#39;t look like much from the outside, but once the food came out, I knew it was good. I went with my grandma and aunt (who swore it was great). They were right! We had the sweetest server. Rocio, I think her name was. She was very helpful when we were picking out what we wanted to eat and brought our food out very quickly.We ordered the mofongo and the rellena de papa as appetizers. They were delicious! Mofongo was quite garlic-y but I enjoyed it. Then my aunt and I got the guisado de res (beef stew) with white rice and beans. They even sell Maltas there, so I got one to drink! Grandma ordered the lechon with arroz con gandules. I tried her lechon and it was great! Everything was superb and the portions were huge! I ate a ton and couldn&#39;t even fit dessert. I ended up taking lots of food home!Bottom line: if you want to get the most for your money, come here. Delicious food and great service. Just beware it is metered street parking which is something like $3/hour."
ground-control-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ground-control-chicago,11/26/13 , 5 ," The first time I came here, I ordered the sweet potato tacos and they were very good.  The second time I went, I tried the beet burger and it was not very flavorful/ the bread was soo thick that I just took out one whole slice and ate the toppings on top of one slice of bread...My friend ordered the same entree both times (the po boy), which was really tasty because of the garlic mayo.  I guess it really matters what your order.  They made stir-fried collared greens for me on the side, instead of the beer-battered greens, which was really nice of them.  The greens were pretty good, and my friend got fries.  The fries were tasty but we usually prefer sweet potato fries.I wanted to try the chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting but it was sold out when we asked to order it.  I was a little dismayed that, even if available, it was $6.50 per slice.  I am not sure how big the slices are, but if the cake is amazing, I am willing to fork over the money to taste it, especially because it is vegan and has peanut butter/chocolate!Overall, it is good to check out but be careful what you order (or get the vegan garlic mayo on the side)"

schallers-pump-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/schallers-pump-chicago,11/06/09 , 5 ," OK now. Here was my surprise. I had for a long time heard about the bar and the butt steak, and the history. Especially the history. So I had pictured in my mind a big old 19th century bar with lot&#39;s of wood, old booths, not so much a salt-of-the-earth basement rec room that looks as if it dates back to about 1960 instead of the real date of 1881. I felt like the five of us who went there, four neophytes, and two of them unsuspecting West Coasters, had gotten into my Scion time machine and had been transported to Oconto, WI. Not that that&#39;s a BAD thing, mind you!Walking in is like entering a saloon in the Old West, where everyone turns to look at you, and you think: &#34;Gee, I better be friendly and say &#34;hi&#34;, or somebody might beat me up.&#34; So we all did. But a genuinely friendly crowd AND a waitress who calls you &#34;Hon.&#34; I just love that.So we all ordered the Butt Steak. Our lovely server sold us on their famous hash browns, so we had the bean soup:  a little salty but well-spiced and flavored and with chunks of ham in it, the steak, which was around 8 oz, sitting on soggy white bread, fries, the requisite thimble of cole slaw, fries, and the hash browns. if I were you, I&#39;d skip the must-have-been-frozen fries and get the hash Browns. They must use very sweet and fresh potatoes. Nicely browned and crunchy, too.The menu has a standard selection of other bar foods, but don&#39;t think &#34;appetizers&#34; because there is no such section. The subject of dessert never even came up. So it was five guys, five steaks, the side of hash browns, two pitchers of domestic beer (and two Heinies for the guy from Portland), all this for $84.50. A steak dinner with drinks for under $20 per person? That&#39;s it. My little Scion must be a magic time machine.Good food, decent steaks, excellent hospitality and salt of the earth dining with good company in Bridgeport, Chicago&#39;s own basement rec room neighborhood."
bombacignos-j-and-c-inn-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bombacignos-j-and-c-inn-chicago-2,03/25/13 , 5 ," Did I really just walk twenty blocks round-trip just for a sandwich? Yes. Yes, I did. You may ask why. I certainly did. Sometimes my willingness to travel for good food astonishes even me.Yet even when there&#39;s a bevy of sandwich places less than a stone&#39;s throw from my office (Corner Bakery, Potbelly, Subway), I almost never eat a sandwich for lunch and I certainly never crave them. They&#39;re typically unsatisfying and unappealing to me, and cold sandwiches even more so.Some intrepid Yelpers convinced me to take the plunge on this miraculous smoked turkey sandwich on focaccia bread, so cold weather and many blocks be damned, I did.This unassuming little place is a home run. Many, many items on the chalkboard menu called out to me and I will definitely be back to try them (lemon chicken breast sandwich, cottage fries, caprese sandwich, eggplant parmagiana) but on this day, I went with the turkey sandwich many others raved about.The menu warns that if you substitute ingredients or make modifications to the items that it will take longer to prepare, so if you&#39;re one of those &#34;Sally&#34; (from &#34;When Harry Met Sally&#34;) types, be warned. I suggest eating everything on the menu just as God and Bombacigno&#39;s intended and shut up and enjoy it. Because you will.It was a most tasty concoction. Plenty of smoked turkey, provolone, ripe tomatoes, crisp lettuce and mildly sweet balsamic vinegar nestled in delicious, tomato-y focaccia bread. The cold pasta salad served on the side (although I wish it was room temperature and not &#34;refrigerator&#34; cold) is as magical as everyone states. The sandwich is nearly $10 but you could probably split it with someone and be full, especially if you add on the cottage fries everyone and their mother seemed to be ordering.Suddenly, walking twenty blocks doesn&#39;t seem like such a crazy idea after all."

It is a nice laid back atmosphere. They have a great beer selection with a lot of different option on tap. They also had some nice ciders for those non-beer drinking folk like myself.  I&#39;ve also had cocktails which are excellent and reasonably priced for the area.Service has been a mixed bag.  The table service was just okay.  We now prefer to sit at the bar as we know the bartender and have had much better service.The food is just okay.  I wouldn&#39;t come out of my way to go for the food - this is really a bar.  However, if you are in for drinks and need a bit to eat, its a solid option. I&#39;ve tried a few things.  The burger was okay but over-hyped.  I prefer the wraps and like the tomato tortilla option. The wings are a solid starter too."

old-jerusalem-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-jerusalem-chicago,06/17/14 , 5 ," I went here last night after deciding fast food wasn&#39;t the way to go :) Glad we did. It was a beautiful night out (after the rain) and we wanted to eat outside.. The waiter and staff were very attentive and got our seats all dried off so we could enjoy our meal outdoors.We ordered the Tebouleh salad which was delicious and had a lot of flavor to it. For our main meal we split the Shawirma. It was was presented different from any place I have had before. Instead of shredded lamb and beef it was slices. It actually did taste like a gyros. Hummus was served underneath it. I appreciated the uniqueness of the presentation, but I have had better hummus.Guess I should mention what my friend really enjoyed about this place is it&#39;s BYOB. I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of BYOB establishments on Wells street, so will have to make sure we remember to go that route. Next time I plan on getting dessert and trying the Bakalava. Nice establishment and I will return to try more food items."
homestead-on-the-roof-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/homestead-on-the-roof-chicago,07/24/14 , 5 ," My review for Homestead is way, way, way over due.  My visit occurred during Restaurant Week, but it was a very memorable visit, and I definitely wanted to review it.  I start with my only complaint and that would be about the server.  She was borderline rude and didn&#39;t really add anything to our experience.  it wasn&#39;t enough to take away more than one star, but I wish servers were a little bit more professional in this city.Our visit was during Restaurant Week but was during the week, so even though my friend made reservations, we didn&#39;t need them.  My boyfriend and I arrived a little bit earlier than our friends who were joining us, so we grabbed a drink at that bar.  He couldn&#39;t stop raving even a couple of weeks after about his drink.  He ordered the Weston, which is a bourbon-based drink infused with both coffee and tobacco.  He to this day says that it is the best drink he has every had.  Mine was good, but not quite that memorable.We started with the most amazing breadbasket I have ever had!  Seriously, it was so, so delicious we all couldn&#39;t stop loving on it.  For the salad course, I went with the kale salad--clearly the healthier choice, but not the right choice. I had a bite of the duck egg salad and really regretted my choice in kale that night.  For the appetizer course, I ordered the mussels.  Mussels and scallops are tied as my favorite seafoods, so I&#39;ve had a lot of both.  These mussels were absolutely incredible.  I loved them!  My meal could have ended there, and I would have been totally satisfied.  If you are a mussel lover, you have to get them!  For my entree, I ordered the skatefish, which had a very interesting presentation with foam on top--literally, it looks like dishsoap foam.  It didn&#39;t add that much to the dish, and I wasn&#39;t blown away like I was with the mussels.  Last but certainly not least, dessert!   I ordered the beet and chocolate dessert.  I&#39;m a huge lover of beats and beets, but not really of super sweet desserts.  I loved this dessert.  It was incredible unique, and the flavor combination was just incredible.The only drawback of Homestead was the server.  I really, really wanted more bread to finish off the broth that the mussels came in, but that seemed to be big problem.  As was wrapping up my friend&#39;s dessert because she was to full to eat it.  She literally wouldn&#39;t wrap it up and insisted the chef made her bring it to the table for the presentation.  The customer should always be right."
antico-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/antico-chicago,01/24/14 , 5 ," We first stumbled upon Antico when we were apartment hunting.  It was such an added bonus to finding a neighborhood and apartment we really liked!  It was the summer so the back patio was open, and was lovely.  You dine among the fresh vegetables, lettuces, and herbs they grow in the garden for your meals.  The inside seating is also very cozy and warm in the colder months.We did the quattro corso the first time we dined there and proceed to have it every time.  $50 for an antipasti, primi, secondi, and dolci - many options within each category, and a great quality and quantity of food for the price. I honestly have never picked a combo of dishes that I did not love.  All of the pastas are made in house, and the brown butter gnocci is absolutely amazing.  In the fall/winder they do a pumpkin/squash gnocci that is also to die for.  All of the meat/fish secondi dishes are served with steamed broccoli and smokey potatoes ( the smokiness is spectacular).  The panna cotta and zepule are our favorite desserts, along with port and coffee.Of course we always wash it all down with a bottle of vino - the Nebbiolo selection is great and is our standard choice.  The waitstaff is always the same group of 4-5 people and all of them are very knowledgeable about the food and wines, and provide impeccable service.  We come to this gem for both nights out and special occasions, because we love it that much!"

It&#39;s a Bridgeport staple and I&#39;m happy that they renovated after the fire. It looks so much better and more modern.I came here earlier this week with a friend. I got a small Italian ice and he got a pizza puff. I have always liked their Italian ice. I haven&#39;t had Ricobene&#39;s Italian ice, so I can&#39;t compare the neighborhood competition. However, I saw my friend&#39;s pizza puff and it looked more like a calzone. It was huge! It was like half a football. It wasn&#39;t particularly tasty either. The crust was hard. Too hard to bite through so he just cut through it. He took a bite and pushed it away.Come for the italian ice because it&#39;s open until midnight. Don&#39;t come for pizza puff."
the-allis-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-allis-chicago-3,09/14/14 , 5 ," I&#39;m a fan. Love x2 the ambience and vibe. Classy but casual and unpretentious. We usually come here for drinks and end up getting a few items to share. Can&#39;t help but always end up wanting to munch on something here because of the table spread they have next to the bar. The old fashioned and negroni are fabulous.Not sure what the other reviewer is complaining about in terms of not plating the food well. Soho House is British-inspired and they have very classic British items on the menu like the Scotch egg, pork pie and sausage roll. You eat it just like and it&#39;s not supposed to be garnished like at a fine dining place. Even Jamie Oliver would have served it like it is served at The Allis. The Scotch egg is ahhhhmazing.Breakfast here is wonderful too. They have boiled eggs and soldiers (can&#39;t get these British classics anywhere else in Chicago)."

And I&#39;m not a cucumber fan, but the way it all comes together with the mayo sauce is ridic.Aaaaand I&#39;d like to take a bath in that Giardiniera.Fries are also quite good. I just give them to my 2 year old because I&#39;m a terrible parent, but whatever, he was hungry and I had fries I wasn&#39;t eating.It&#39;s worth a trip out if your way, but just remember, you&#39;re eating in your car or taking it home.

It hit the spot after a whole day of not eating anything.I was personally not a fan of the bun because I hate that flour-y doughy taste of the top bun. Also, my friend and I cut our burgers in half to split and by the time I got to eating his burger, the bottom of the bun had gotten pretty soggy - not fun to eat no matter how good the burger is!Sweet potato fries or the truffle aioli fries are perfect sides with the burger.Service was great.

riccardo-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/riccardo-enoteca-chicago,04/12/14 , 5 ," I&#39;ve been wanting to come to Riccardo Enoteca since moving to the neighborhood a year ago and falling in love with its sister restaurant across the street, Riccardo Trattoria.I have to say, our experience was pleasant and I have to believe that the negative reviews are from the time frame when the restaurant was new and just getting into its own groove.My fiancé and I were seated at 6 pm on a Friday without a reservation, but the place filled up quickly after we arrived (and isn&#39;t large to begin with). We were greeted by a nice server who peppered some Italian into his service all night, which was well played if not a little corny. Service was a reasonable speed throughout the meal, giving us time to order drinks, enjoy our appetizer, and decide on a main dish without feeling rushed.The fried mozzarella was an upscale twist on a fried mozzarella stick and went well with the arugula, cherry tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar it was served with. I loved the Orichette Puligese, which was a pasta dish with spinach, Italian sausage, and a hint of spice from chili flakes. My fiancé wasn&#39;t too happy with his pizza, but only because he failed to realize that the Caprese pizza would have whole slices of tomatoes on it...and he hates tomatoes. I thought it was delicious and that it was a nice option if you don&#39;t want a pizza with a ton of cheese.Overall this was a great option for dinner and I can see us coming back for drinks and small plates in the future."

Dissss mak meeeee very happpiiiii. Here&#39;s the order people! Prepare yourself:// rock shrimp tempura - $6 - tempura fried shrimpys that have a great spicy sauce on top. And get this.. 6$ gets you 10 MOTHER FLIPPIN&#39; pieces! Ha so basically. It&#39;s pretty filling.// spider roll - $9 - yummmmm i love spider rolls. Pretty standard but well made. And great! I think this one has soft shell crab in it and was huge!// shrimp tempura - $6 - pretty large roll and the shrimp was made very nicely.// UIC roll - $12 - WOO WOO REPRESENT SON&#39; UIC ALL THE WAY. Actually in all honestly this roll was delicious. It was topped with white tuna/fish (can&#39;t remember) and a little tempura crumbs. With a bit of spicy sauce on top. So good. The fish was so fresh and would just melt in your mouth. Definitely get this one.// salmon avocado - $6 - standard roll. We always get it because the fish is so good.I forgot home many pieces come with each roll but they include it on the menu. Another reason I love it. You don&#39;t have to ask your waiter/waitress how many blah blah blah. You get it. Right?Oh and did I mention.. It is BYOB?! DOUBLE WIN!So yeah, if you are in the south side area I would definitely checkOut this place. They also have group ons once in a while. Alsoooo free edamame if you check in on YELP!

I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what Hawaiian food is or how it is prepared. I was slightly intrigued. I learned chicken katsu is basically chicken thighs pounded out super thin and breaded with panko crumbs on steroids and deep fried. The result is extremely crunchy chicken.

You&#39;d never know that BDP existed if it weren&#39;t for the internet. Hidden among all the warehouses on the Near West Side this place puts together a pretty healthy lunch or coffee option if you&#39;re over this way.Mostly known for their catering but the canteen menu has featured lunch options each day, good coffee, and pre-made salads and sandwiches. Perfect for the busy bee who&#39;s always doing breakfast or lunch on the fly.It&#39;s pretty easy to park and I&#39;m guessing almost never super busy.

I can see why there are so many reviews since this place is cheap! A lot cheaper and better tasting than their newest location, Chiang Mai on Western.The only thing I would knock off is the smell upon walking through the door.

old-lviv-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-lviv-chicago,12/16/14 , 5 ," A couple years ago, this used to be one of my favorite homestyle, grandma-feeling places to go eat. It just made me feel like I was in an older Ukrainian couple&#39;s home and they were feeding me with pride. The buffet concept is great, too, although I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s the reason the quality of the food has gone so downhill. This past time I went, some of the food was so dry or old that it was practically inedible. The buffet is already kind of pricey per person for what you get, especially considering the pierogi are extra. It still has the grandma&#39;s home feeling, but now it feels more like grandma is on her deathbed trying to cook and run a business. I will say that I appreciated watching Wheel of Fortune while I waited for our check, although it appeared the owners were much more engulfed in figuring out the words than we were and we apparently had to wait until commercial to pay."

I am actually calling for pick-up for this place tonight to try more of their dishes.I had the Duck Curry and my girlfriend had the Pineapple Fried Rice.

Actually, any excuse will do for me to stop - I should do it more often - especially since I found out that eating a half pound of those wonderful, delightful, tasty pawns, is not so bad on my calorie intake. Yes, I went back out on my bicycle again today... And my tummy was so happy!There&#39;s a contest of sorts to win a shrimp dinner - all one has to do is &#34;like&#34; Troha&#39;s on Facebook - but I love them and there&#39;s no &#34;love&#34; them on Facebook.... Wait, I don&#39;t have a page, (I know, so NOT; 21st century - I&#39;m a face-to-face kind of gal)... I&#39;ll just go and buy another 1/2 pound for the road and a pound for home.You guys are the BEST!!!Oh, I just noticed my previous reviews - I&#39;ve missed reviewing a few times... But really folks this place is a gem,... No, it&#39;s gold. No... better, PLATINUM!Just go, see for yourself - you&#39;ll be hooked - (Fish House - hooked, hahaha:-). Pun intended."
puffs-of-doom-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/puffs-of-doom-chicago,08/13/12 , 5 ," I stumbled across Puffs of Doom at the Logan Square farmer&#39;s market this weekend.  To be honest, the little cream puffs caught my eye, and then the interesting business name drew me in.  My mom and I chatted with the guys working a bit and I decided I had to try one.  I had the strawberry Nutella puff (so adorable!) and it was delicious - a delectable bit of goodness and happiness!So, folks, if you see this stand at the farmer&#39;s market or if they are in the neighborhood, definitely try them out.  The BLT one looked amazing, but I had just consumed the biggest brunch ever, so I will save that one for next time."

home-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/home-bistro-chicago,11/05/14 , 5 ," Yowsa, this was one of the most delicious and flavorful dinners we have had in a while.  The flavors in every course were all so complimentary and distinctive.  To boot, we enjoyed the $33 pp prix fixe dining option on this Wednesday evening.  What was particularly nice for this prix fixe was that you pick whatever 3 courses you want from the regular menu, and it looked to be roughly a $12 pp discount.  It&#39;s also BYOB, and I brought in some FFF Gumballhead, but almost every other table had either wine or champagne it appeared (good for them, but beer was perfect for us).   So, I ordered up:- Housemade corn dogs (not from the ballpark, but rather made of beef short rib)- Braised beef cheek fettuccine- Cranberry bread puddingWife ordered:- Smoked eggplant appetizer- Belgian endive salad- Rainbow trout, which came with a fried egg (this was best course of all the very good ones we had).The menu photo has a much better description of the courses.  The only minor knock was the fettuccine was slightly undercooked.  Otherwise, awesome meal and a charming venue.  This place is tiny (we counted 14 tables) and can get noisy when filled, but it would also be a great date night sort of place.  At regular prices, I would say it would be on the spendy side.  Server was Amy, and she was very friendly, attentive, and always had a nice smile.  She and the help were also very efficient.  The place has been around for 10 years, and it&#39;s high average 4.5 star Yelp rating for 700 reviews is well deserved.  FYI - I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any free parking in the area - it&#39;s standard metered $2/hour with the rest of the area looking to be permit parking.  Overall, great place to try at least once and highly recommended."

They are very attentive and friendly.The food itself is pretty good! I like to get sandwiches as salads. Like the cranberry turkey sandwich. The Fresh Mozz is good and simple. The hot dog is really tasty! Their potato salad is decent.Also that Garbage Shake....decadent. Pumpkin shakes are awesome in the fall. Willing to go through the pain of lactose intolerance for those shakes...but only once a season.Overall, the Med is a solid hyde park restaurant with lots of variety on their menu, although I always end up opting for their neighbor Z&amp;H when it comes to sandwiches."

Make sure you get the Steak Tacos, not the beef ones(not that the beef ones are bad, but the steak tacos are amazing). The Tongue tacos are also amazing.  Burritos are huge and tamales have lots of flavor.  The tacos are expensive, but I only typically have two. Three are too much."
little-bucharest-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-bucharest-bistro-chicago,11/07/14 , 5 ," Little Bucharest Bistro has an airy, spacious interior and thanks to plenty of large windows, the setting isn&#39;t dim. For those who wish to sit outside, there is outside seating, but having arrived early, indoor seating next to a window worked perfectly for me. Although Eastern European food is something that I prefer mostly when the temperatures are chilly, I asked my server for recommendations, while informing her that vegetarian is my first preference and seafood is my second. The offerings that I got had exceeded my expectations.For a starter, I had borscht. At Little Bucharest Bistro, there was definitely a flavouring of cooked beets from a garden that didn&#39;t leave an overpowering taste. It was also nice that the soup was full of beets and not just beet juice. Second to the table was the village salad, which consisted of red bell peppers, green bell peppers, red onions, cucumber, feta cheese, tomatoes, and olives. Drizzled with a nice balsamic vinaigrette, this was rabbit food I would welcome anytime.A light appetizer that I got next was a plate of eggplant, prepared much like baba ganoush, that was served with pita bread, a small salad, and a melange of pickles, crepes with cream cheese, and salmon. What an offering and this small platter still packed a flavourful punch that I would gladly indulge on future visits. And in keeping with vegetarian dishes, there was the vegetarian goulash. This was a hearty dish of grilled eggplant, cabbage, peppers, spinach, and garlic couscous in a tomato sauce. I was expecting something along the lines of a spaetzle, but the goulash was a classic example of different being outstanding.This first experience is definitely all the more reason I shall have to return again very, very soon to see what other menu items they have to convert me into a regular customer."
the-artisan-cellar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-artisan-cellar-chicago,08/04/13 , 5 ," Audrey Hepburn or Marilyn Monroe?I hate that question. I hate that question and I can&#39;t exaggerate my eye roll enough when I hear someone ask it as if it&#39;s black and white, two categories that everyone and their mother, brother, neighbor have to fall into.I know they&#39;re two universally pretty popular figures in history, but I don&#39;t like either of them. At all. I&#39;ve never seen any of their movies, I think all the quotes I&#39;ve heard from them sounds dumb, and I don&#39;t find myself wanting to be or look like either them... Not that they aren&#39;t good looking ladies, but to me they just seem kinda basic. Coupla basic b*tches and I, personally, prefer my heroes, pin-ups, personalities, whatever they are, to be just a little less regular... just like how I like my sandwiches.I know everyone&#39;s loving AC&#39;s sammiches, but personally, I&#39;d go a 3 on the flavors of my Artisan Cellar Farmhouse panini... but then again, these kinds of sandwiches just aren&#39;t my style and I know I&#39;m in the minority.I mean, paninis are cool, I guess, but I hate when bread is hard and crusty and onions are limp, wet, and wormy, and overall I just felt like the stuff inside the sandwich was majorly boring and commonplace and the same kind of thing I&#39;ve had a hundred times before. No spice, no zest, no personality. Just meh.It was only $8, and it was size-able, but it was still what I would consider a basic b*tch&#39;s sandwich and I was hoping for something a little more extraordinary. Maybe their meat sandwiches and wine are where it&#39;s at, or maybe that this is one of the few places for noms within the merch mart that A. Is affordable and B. is decent, but if I&#39;m in the Merch Mart again and faced with a lunchtime dilemma, I&#39;d probably just grab a coffee somewhere to suppress the mid-day hunger over getting a veggie sandwich here again."

Pretty standard cafe with sandwiches, wraps, and salads, but everything is pretty well done. I have had a couple of the wraps such as the Chipotle Chicken and the Caribbean Jerk which were moist. The soup (tomato basil spinach bisque) was better than expected as well.Probably would have gave this place a solid four stars if they weren&#39;t so slow. Not sure if it&#39;s an issue with workflow or me coming in at the wrong times, but I have waited between 30-45 minutes for my food each time."

The poptart was phenomenal. If they weren&#39;t 4 bucks I would have taken one to go.If it wasnt for the quietness and strangeness I felt from the lack of music I would have given this place 5 stars."

small-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/small-burger-chicago,10/23/14 , 5 ," &#34;Small Burger...That&#39;s a HUGE Burger!&#34; I laughed at their sign, and if you can make a girl laugh, you can make her buy a cheeseburger, or something like that. I stopped in here last night since the other half was craving burgers and they are few and far between in Pilsen. The place is almost a literal hole-in-the-wall; it must have been converted from a first floor apartment by the looks of it. It&#39;s small but there were seats at the counter where you can watch the fryer and grill, and a few tables...where you can also watch the fryer and grill I guess since it&#39;s not very big, as I said. The space was clean, well-lit, and decorated festively for Halloween. It also smelled amazing in there due to the sizzling meats.There were just the two staff there last night who I assume are probably the owners, a man on the grill and the woman handling orders and register. The food didn&#39;t take long at all, and I was pleasantly surprised to find lots of ketchup packets in our to go bag - not being stingy on the ketchup is a sign of greatness to me, you can&#39;t eat a large fry with 2 ketchup packets! I&#39;m looking at you, Mickey D&#39;s. But I digress.The burgers are 1/2 lb patties; we got a regular cheeseburger and their signature &#34;Small Burger&#34; - 2 patties (yes, an entire pound of meat), bacon, lettuce, grilled onion, tomato, pickles, &amp; special sauce.  And an order of fries to share. With 2 cans of Pepsi it came to about $17. They cook the burgers two ways - on the flat top and finished on the grill, so you really get that flame cooked taste that I really enjoy at summer BBQs. The fries were hot and crispy on the outside, and soft inside. Even the pickle slices were superior - had a real crunch to them, not the soggy floppy kind. Other than burgers they have some hot dogs, sausage, Italian beef, a pork chop - not a whole lot but your typical burger place grub. We absolutely will go back since it&#39;s so close to us and a welcome respite from the sea of tacos on the street, the other half wants to try their jalapeno burger next!"
the-promontory-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-promontory-chicago,08/04/14 , 5 ," There&#39;s &#34;good&#34; and then there&#39;s &#34;Hyde Park good.&#34; I haven&#39;t written off this place yet, but for now I&#39;m putting it in the latter category.Right off the bat, the value doesn&#39;t feel as good as its sister spot, Dusek&#39;s. The prices seem similar, but I just like my experience in Pilsen better. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth trekking to Hyde Park from elsewhere just for a meal here.The space is very cool. I think next time I come here it will be for drinks because the patio is breezy and the bar area is warm and inviting. Also kudos for not placing the tables rightnexttoeachother (don&#39;t you hate when someone&#39;s arse is in your face just because they&#39;re trying to shimmy between tables?).The food was pretty good. I had the cornbread panzanella (will pass on this next time as it was pretty forgettable and not well composed) and the pork/fried clam po boy (tasty, but had to knife-and-fork it because it was impossible to eat--them fries doe, they were crispy and fatty the way I like &#39;em). I had the carbonated daiquiri to drink and it was major blerg--first, it tasted nothing like the name would suggest, and it had so much lime juice that hubs almost spit it out when he tried a taste.The service was OK except for this: friends told the waitress they&#39;d order wine when their meals came, and she insisted on taking the order then so that she could bring the wine out *with* the food. OK. Food came, no wine. Nearly halfway through our meal, no wine. Had to ask to bring the wine. Probably wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal if she hadn&#39;t made a point to tell us it would come out with the food.To be sure, there was nothing *wrong* with the experience. And I anticipate in the coming months, this place will be elevated to just plain &#34;good.&#34;PS: Make a reservation!"

By far the best proximity wise to me hands down though! My Mexican friends all swear by this place, so you know it is good. Last night, my friend and I decided to come here and give it a try because we been wanting to try this place for the longest, and we were both craving tacos. Upon arriving, the place is kinda older and hard to find, but the inside is surprisingly clean. They have a yellow sign on the outside, but for some reason it wasn&#39;t lit up at night, so we missed it the first time. Inside was packed to capacity, but the ordering to go line was only a few people. We&#39;ve decided to order to go and we both ordered 2 steak tacos with the green sauce and a jarritos to complete our order. The total came out to $5.99 per person, which is really cheap for the best tacos.The workers are really nice and the people working there are so fast. They wrapped the tacos perfectly so when you eat it on the go, it isn&#39;t too messy. The steak was so perfectly cooked and season to perfection. Make sure you ask for the green sauce because this is the icing on the cake to an already perfect taco. I will definitely come back here in the future and my biggest regret was not ordering more!"

Pleasant people -- all contributing to my higher than would have been rating.Food - imagine a fast food Chinese restaurant....only Japanese recipes used, kinda. My wife and son were more forgiving than me, hence they look much younger than I do.We ordered many dishes. I am glad we did not order sashimi. Checking it at another table, looked poorly cut and badly presented.Service - Good, albeit rushed. Please donot hand in the check with the desert. Regardless I really liked our server.Ambiance.  For Bucktown people kinda reminded me of Silver Cloud only obviously nowhere as good.  For an Izakaya (Japanese bar) interesting how many families with kids, like us were there.Other highly positive reviews. With all due respect to people&#39;s personal taste when a few reviews from people with limited reviews and &#34;friends&#34; come up, i do not take it seriously. Regardless the end result will be an overly bloated average rating.I had given Takashi, next door a one star too ....walking by it on after our meal at Mita i wished we had gone there instead.We had wanted to try Mita ever since they were doing construction, as they are a neighborhood restaurant. So I feel as bad for us as for them that the dinner was not good. Sorry guys, I really wanted to like your &#34;izakaya.&#34; Sincerely wishing you success."
hing-kee-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hing-kee-restaurant-chicago-2,11/04/14 , 5 ," Hands down, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago&#39;s Chinatown. I&#39;m genuinely perplexed why the reviews skew so low. Why is this place the bestest? The amazing hand-pulled noodles, that&#39;s why.The cost for a bowl of soup here has inflated since the first time I stopped by a year ago, but I&#39;m happy to pay the premium for some amazing noodles. I want to take these slurp-worthy strings of deliciousness home to my mom and pledge my undying love, that&#39;s how good they are. Order anything off their special one-page soup menu. You&#39;ll like it.Also, if you&#39;re looking for the best xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in the city, you can make your trip a two-for-one special by stopping by Hing Kee. We weren&#39;t intending to find xiao long bao, but my wife noticed it on the menu the first trip here, and we always order it even if it feels gluttonous on top of everything else we&#39;ve already picked out. Five of five members of her xiao long bao-loving extended family agree. These things rock socks.There&#39;s signage outside the store espousing Hing Kee as the best pho for some Grubhubbian food service or another, which is strange, since the owners and waitstaff are Cantonese. Now I do crave pho constantly, and maybe if I don&#39;t want to make the Chiberia trek to Argyle, I&#39;ll one day check it out. There&#39;s also a sushi bar, from which I&#39;ve seen approximately zero Asians eat. Perhaps the schizophrenic fusion nature of the restaurant leads to negative reviews?If you&#39;re coming here, remember. Noodle soup. Xiao long bao. And some other, Cantonese-y stuff if you&#39;re in the mood."
first-draft-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-draft-chicago,09/17/14 , 5 ," This is slowly becoming my go to spot in the Printers Row. The beer selection is amazing, and somewhat intimidating. I take the strategy of just slowly working my way through it from tip to tail. Just take your time, realize that you&#39;re never going to fully grasp the complexity of everything, and have fun. From a food standpoint, the menu is extensive. On Tuesday they have half price wings, which come in three flavors (all excellent). The service is great, and if you&#39;re sports fan, fear not because they have tons of tv&#39;s that are viewable from just about every seat. It gets a bit crowded in evenings, so if you want to get a table with a lot of people, get there early.If you&#39;re there and the weekends, and chicken and waffles is on the menu, go for it. It&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago."

It is a great place if you want to eat healthy, have a large group or even out with picky eaters. Trust me, even picky eaters will find something they will like! The nice thing is that for protein options they have seiten, tofu, chicken, beef, pork, fish, squid, and of course they&#39;ve longanisa!!! For those who don&#39;t know, longanisa is a Filipino pork sausage that is mighty tasty!!  Helpful hint: mooshu wrappers are huge...I mean personal pan size pizza with the thickness of a pancake. Sometimes they will give you 8 or 10 of them....just make sure you are hungry"

bangers-and-lace-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bangers-and-lace-chicago,03/12/14 , 5 ," I was inspired by Paul B&#39;s Review of the Day about Bangers &amp; Lace and just HAD to check it out.I started my evening with the North by Southeast cocktail for $10. It was my favorite libation of the evening. The flavors were mature, refreshing, with hints of smokey sweetness. Later on I enjoyed the Spruce Goose cocktail (also for $10). It was sour and refreshing, but I will pass on it next time.I ordered two appetizers right away: Pretzel ($4) and Chorizo Deviled Eggs ($6). I truly experienced both of them. The textures transformed while I ate them unleashing new flavors.The pretzel was a perfect size for just me. It was served warm and soft. The exterior was firm and a little chewy. The pretzel could stand on its own but the sauce certainly added a whimsical dimension. The soft texture of the pretzel combined with the molasses sweetness of the dipping sauce reminded me of eating pancakes with syrup.The Chorizo Deviled Eggs had a crusty shell exterior that added a fabulous warm crunch when biting into the otherwise supple, creaminess of the egg. Although the filling of the egg was incredible, that outer husk was an innovative surprise!I chose the Duck BLT ($9) for my entree. It was delicious but unexpected. When I think about BLT, I think of bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The bacon and duck element of this sandwich were combined in the sausage which were sliced into a few logs and pressed between the bread with lettuce and cheese. I adored the bread which is saying a lot. Normally the bread only serves to deliver the innards but, in this case, I loved the consistency and piquancy and could have consumed it all by itself.The service and ambiance at Bangers &amp; Lace was really retro, rustic, and chill. The bar tender rocked an enviable mountain-man beard and changed vinyl records between serving up beer and cocktails. There weren&#39;t many tables for privacy. In fact, the main dining room was dominated by the bar on one side and a single long table for Last Supper-style communion. There was dim, vintage lighting, dark wood, and lace window treatments.Thanks to Paul B and Yelp I have a new, cool place to eat and imbibe while not ransacking my bank account."
the-rosebud-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-rosebud-chicago,03/12/14 , 5 ," Meh. It was just alright. I was here for a reservation for a large group that was booked well in advance and everything that was wrong would have been better if they provided us with a second waitress for such a large group. Drinks didn&#39;t get refilled, some drinks were forgotten, we had to ask for butter for the bread and it came a half hour later. Some food was lukewarm and the wait time was long but I assumed that was because of dish variety. Maybe these things are super picky but when you pay for the prices you do at rosebud... You&#39;d think the experience would be worth it.Overall it was just okay. I assume it would be a better experience for a small table and not a big group??"

I had made a reso and still had to wait 20 min. Sorry, that automatically knocks off a star. We were seated by the aisle and usually this bugs me, but servers were very observant to not nudge or bump into me.Although our server looked like my former evil boss, I tried to not hold it against her as she was really prompt and helpful when we had questions. We order 2 glasses of Pinot noir and while they were decent, they required breathing to be drinkable. Maybe they just opened this bottle? Idk. They were very tangy at first. Decent but drinkable later.We received the complimentary bread which was definitely the best freaking bread I&#39;ve had in a while. Took all my strength to not eat a whole loaf. We ordered mujver since yelp told me to and it was exquisite. Not too heavily breaded to overstuff you, and the sauce was the boss. I had the salmon that came with gnocchi. Salmon was just ok, same taste as store bought. So much gnocchi in this dish, I had to box it up for another day. Gnocchi was also standard. He had the yogurt kabap which was the same sauce as the mujver but with lamb. He loved it.From the looks of the menu and reviews, this is definitely more of a lamb-driven spot. It seems the most popular dishes are lamb and that&#39;s all good. It&#39;s just not the spot I&#39;m really gonna enjoy most. Oh well, at least everyone saw my new, cute jeans."

My mom and I came in and I was just as impressed as the first time. My mom ordered a seafood linguini and I ordered the rack of lamb. Both were absolutely delicious. I can&#39;t get over the quality of food this restaurant is able to produce. The rack of lamb was so tender and juicy and the linguini was probably the best that I have ever had. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and it was just as good as the first time. I&#39;m constantly blown away by how amazing this restaurant is and I would highly suggest it to anyone and everyone!"

Very helpful and welcoming serviceIf you don&#39;t know what to get, just get pork. Cubans kick ass at porkIf you want variety, ask them about their sampler platter; it&#39;s great and is way more food than you think. It will easily feed two hungry people and leave them both a bit happier about the idea of opening up diplomatic and trade relations with this tiny county of happy people, beautiful women, gorgeous beaches, and FANTASTIC FOOD"
