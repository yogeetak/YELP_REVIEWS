Warning, the building is near the Pier, so you may want to wait for a couple of hours before leaving the building. \n\nGot there a little before 730PM &amp; was seated on the patio within minutes. Our server was great from beginning to end, made sure we were enjoying ourselves &amp; made sure to tell us not to rush anything since fireworks started at 930PM. We got bread upon sitting.

  8 While being touristy in Chicago with my boyfriend and his mom, we came to Pinstripes because it was within walking distance from Navy Pier and the Ogilvie train station. It was a solid find! \n\nIt&#39;s got an upscale twist on bar games with bowling, bocce, and decidedly not-bar-quality food. Unfortunately we didn&#39;t have time to enjoy a round of bocce before heading back to our train, but we did enjoy a leisurely meal. \n\nOn our way in we were given cards good for a free appetizer with entree purchase. Being Wisconsinites, we opted for the fried mozzarella. What&#39;s a meal without cheese, after all? It appeared they breaded and fried mozzarella pearls which made for a nice bite-sized snack without the unmanageable strings of melted cheese sticks tend to result in. \n\nFor my lunch I went for the Grilled Chicken Club.
